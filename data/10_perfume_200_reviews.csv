0,CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994," This has been my staple since 1994 when I was in high school, still love this today. The green tea base note is AMAZING!!🥰🥰🥰 U already know. First impression: Enjoyed the depth that the herbal and woody undertones added to the synthetic citrus body. However, the more I returned to the scent, the more like a cleaning product it smelled to me. Lemon Windex? Nonetheless, it layers very nicely with the organic sweetness of D&G's Light Blue which tempers the synthetic lemon and creates a light but fairly complex citrus scent. Totally unisex and timeless-- a clean, bright scent that would be appropriate for most occasions. You can't go wrong with it, but you certainly won't stand out either. looooove it, reminds me of my high school days. sadly doesn't last at all, i used to literally douse myself in this but it was gone in an hour lol. super fresh, clean and juicy! Urban normcore / Y2K techno-utopian soapy (modern, not aldehydic) vibe. The Smart Casual of perfumery. However, it feels like it might be approaching the cusp of becoming dated in the near future I bought it as a gift for my fiancé about two or three years ago, and he didn't like it, so I got this perfume. I think it's really cool, fresh, citrusy scent, but it still smells fruity. In summer, I like to wear it in the very heat, or at home, for example, when cleaning or after morning workouts and showers. I think it's a super everyday fragrance. There's nothing intrusive about it. Clean, easy to wear, absolutely unisex. Longevity is great, even on my skin, but especially on clothes. My heart sunk when I received my new bottle. It’s reformulated beyond no return. I was using a dupe brand that’s sold in stores and it smelled so good. Clean, Citrusy, And sexy. I thought well damn this smells just as Good as I remember ck1 smelling. I thought let me buy an authentic bottle of it since it’s a classic and it’s still smells delicious. Well I thought wrong. It’s powdery and tweaked way too much. It just doesn’t perform like it used to. I’ll wear it til it’s gone and forever leave it in the past. CK ONE.
Where to start, this fragrance is what originally got me into citrus fragrances. For the longest time when ever I smelled citrus I could only think of cleaning products. Luckily I smelled this when I did because sense then it has opened a whole new world to me. 
CK ONE has a pineapple opening but it's very distinct it's one of those things where it's hard to describe to someone unless they have smelled it as well.
Honestly this is a great fragrance for any age point be it 14 or 80. Great buy for the price lovely warm weather fragrance. 
Projection 5/10 Very personal scent.
Sillage 5/10 It's in the air but it's not refer to above.
Longevity 4/10 It's a freshy but it does not last as long as other alternatives.
Scent 7/10 This is where this fragrance really makes up ground.
Grade B+. Quite nice fresh back in the day fragrance that most like no wow factor with refreshing notes of green tea, papaya, and bergamot balanced with soft accents of nutmeg, violet, cardamom, and rose.just a everyday gym or work frag. Alberto Morillas. I shouldn't have to say anything else about this classic Generic soapy-mossy shower gel/Glade air freshener vibe. Smells cheap, is cheap. Won't offend anyone, but neither will it make an impression.
Outdated freshie. Time to move on to more natural scents vs. these synthetic concoctions.
Grade: C-
Quick take: generic mossy shower gel I remember this fragrance from when I was in high school in the mid 90s. A neighbor/teacher that I would catch a ride to school with practically bathed in this stuff. It was super trendy. I have a new bottle and I believe it’s fruiter smelling than it used to be. The initial smell before the dry down reminds me a little bit of Froot Loops cereal. A perfectly unisex fragrance that will have you smelling fresh and clean for a fantastic price. It opens up with bright citruses, and as it dries down, all the floral notes and the green notes come through. The green notes give a dewy vibe, so along with the floral accords, it smells like a fresh spring garden. Throughout the whole lifespan of the fragrance, the musk is quite prominent too, which gives it a bit more depth and intrigue, and balances out the florals to make it more unisex.
Performance is moderate, but better than expected given that it's a fresh, cheaper fragrance. Of course, it's nothing groundbreaking, but it's so difficult to dislike, and at such a low price point, is a fantastic fragrance for any occasion, especially for the warmer weather. This is what everyone should smell like all the time. I wore this all through high school. One sniff and it immediately takes me back. I still have my bottle. It has hardly any left. Now I just save it for the memories. In 1994, Calvin Klein advertising was everything. Wearing a unisex fragrance made us feel like we were shunning the high school girl norms. While our classmates were drowning themselves in cucumber melon or Clinique Happy and others I don’t remember, my best friend and I thought we were oh so edgy in our ck One. I still like the smell, but it’s nothing I would wear today. I’m practically anti citrus & fresh scents now. But at the time, Calvin knew how to make citrus fresh and clean SO sexy. As odd as it sounds, when I wasn’t wearing this I was dousing myself in patchouli oil, which I still love to this day. I've always smelled this one on people. It truly puts me in the mind of PE 360. I had a sample of this and only tried it once. It is very fresh on the initial spray, and I liked that it was a more masculine scent, but as the day went on I couldn't get the idea that this smelled *dirty* out of my head. It was so strange, like this after-cloud of someone with bad hygiene. I have no idea what was happening or why it went so sour on me but unfortunately this one really does not agree with my body chemistry. I could see why people like it, just get yourself a sample first to make sure it works for you. If you´re looking for a complicated and complex scent, this ain´t for you. But - if you´re looking for a clean, fresh scent which is good for the office, a dinner with your friends or even a date this is for you. LOVE IT! Fresh, airy lemon... pleasant, clean scent. I like the smell of this, but I bought this as a gift from my ex boyfriend who cheated on me and that's all I associate the scent with now. It's crazy how much fragrance causes ties to memories of times & people, my mind is trapped haha! I have memories of pretty teenage girls in the 90s that smelled like this (I was just a little kid so to me they seemed so sophisticated lol). Fresh, citrusy, green, unisex. It works really well in warmer weather without being overwhelming. It's certainly one of my favorites that I'll always keep a bottle of. I used to be a bit snobby about CK One but I’ve really come to appreciate what a lovely fragrance it is. Truly unisex and super fresh, it’s just comforting to wear on a nice day, fresh out of the shower with a clean t-shirt. Can it be more WC-duck than this?
Yuck, who wants to smell like a cleaning session of the toilet? Powdery citrus, opens up freshly. Mid and bottom notes deep and powdery. Cirtusy and fresh, a little bit sweet in the dry down on my skin. To me it smells very clean, just the perfect scent for everyday, and mostly the warmer seasons (but imo it works quite well in medium cold weather). A great, simple unisex scent. Only negative thing I can say about is that it has a weak longevity. Still a classic! I remember this being a bright citrus scent with a spicy dry down. The spicy aura must be the cardamom and nutmeg. To me it fell under the cologne category but I prefer more feminine scents. This frag is much more unisex than what is labeled unisex these days but people can where anything they like regardless of category. There's no wrong or right. Come on ladies and gents lol..., yea it’s weak but it’s a classic. We don’t need to smell like a king every where we go at all times plus let’s consider the younger demographic that will appreciate this like we used to do back in the day. My BEST advice, grab this bcs it’s super affordable and bathe in it and then layer it with Acua Di Gio. Your good stuff will last longer and you’ll smell good all the way around and you won’t need to worry about losing or break your good bottle and just leave the CK in the glove box or gym bag. The beginning of this perfume feels rather masculine to me (because of the strong citrus notes). However, as it starts to dry down, I can see how it leans towards a more unisex smell. I would say it smells quite soapy and citrusy. It is quite inoffensive and a very mass-appealing scent, something you could find in everything from body soaps to deodorants. Probably a very good choice when you want to smell clean and approachable. 
Overall score: 6/10 this was very good in the 90's when it first came out i had a bottle . it had a bitter citrus note in the old bottles thats what made it ck one special back then i remember it . the new bottles that note isn't there anymore it was replaced or took out completely . its not worth it really go buy acqua gio instead I would say it is a very safe but. Not fruity or floral but more ozonic green fresh. I loved wearing this in the 90s and I went and bought myself a bottle about 5 years ago knowing I already love it I could just get another one (I was in the hunt for perfumes). The memories from the 90s were too strong and I returned the bottle. They were not bad memories at all but it reminded me I smelled like the 90s and I could not stand it! Now any perfume that resembles that smell or memorie is a big no no for me! Great scent but it needs to stay in the 90s! A great fragrance. Mass appeal, cult following, universal use - it is what it is. 
However many people have been overexposed to it. We find similar notes in air freshners, shampoos, shower gels. It's versatility makes it a safe choise, devoid of true originality. It's not a bad thing sometimes. You can use it anywhere, anytime. 
However I noticed there are many similar fragrances and homage clones worth mentioning (if you cannot afford the real thing or want to save some money). 
A worthy mention could be:
Lidl Aura Unicke – Smells like Calvin Klein’s One original formula. I wish I could go back in time and not have been overexposed to CK One! It was so ubiquitous during my teenage years that I grew sick of it - over-sprayed by obnoxious, hormonal teenage boys in my high school. Ugh. Sadly, it will forever be stuck in that negative scent memory for me. That doesn't mean it's not a good fragrance!! It has its place in fragrance history and luckily for those who love it, it's still being produced and is easy to find in the marketplace today. One must acknowledge its importance (in the US at least) as a trailblazer for unisex fragrances, being the first unisex scent to be hugely popular in this country. I actually love unisex fragrances now and mostly wear citrus/fresh scents so while CK One should be right up my alley, I can't go near a bottle! Scent memory is too strong. Citrusy and spicy. Very cheerful and friendly. Classic unisex. This is a nice blast from the past. I first had a bottle of this when i was 16. Since then, maybe its been reformulated. I thought it was full of pheremones then. Now i love the citrusy opening blast. Dry down is a bit quick and faint. So this is a reach scent when you need a pick me up. I appreciate this is one i could share with my girlfriend. I still think CK Be is better but it doesn't mean this one is a bad choice. Very fresh citrusy scent , great price I wore this a lot 25 years ago. 
To my knowledge, this was the first, or one of the first, unisex fragrances. 
Now, almost everything is listed as unisex even if it's not (looking at you bond no 9)
I don't have a problem with that, wear whatever you want. I occasionally wear a couple womens fragrances. 
In any case, this was the true swiss army knife of fragrance. Could be used in just about any casual situation.
This was groundbreaking in another way that it was a much lighter fragrance than many of the 80's and 90's powerhouse scents that came before it.
Definitely a classic that established the fresh and clean genre of fragrances. It might be hard to write a review that does this scent justice. How do you review a fragrance that was so iconic it anchored an entire generation, nay, generations? Boomers, Gen X and millennials all have a special spot in their hippocampus for CK One. Like many of you I'm sure, 2020 and 2021 have made me so disgustingly nostalgic for the past. The past we took for granted. Clubbing, dining, even just walking down the damn street. We took all that shit for granted! 
Anyway, I've been listening to a lot of Utopia on Sirius radio. It's the station for dance hits from the 90s and 2000s. While listening to the remix of Deborah Cox's ""Nobody's Supposed to Be Here,"" I felt this painful gnaw of nostalgia, that same ache which scents like CK One give me. Actually, smelling CK One first makes me think of the Designer Imposter ""U"" that I owned at the time. The real thing was definitely out of my price range but the dupe was pretty good. After ""U"" my second memory is of the 7th grade dance. CeCe Peniston, La Bouche, Everything But the Girl. Plaid polyester and spaghetti straps. Steve Madden version 1.0. Were the mid 90s not the most innocent and invigorating time? Depending on your age you'll have a different answer. 
Perfume is armchair time-travel. I remember when this came out I was in my early teens. I remember all the ads featuring Kate Moss and Donnie Wahlberg and wishing I liked the smell because I liked the models.. I didn't really care for it. Pretty sure either this or the Paco Rabanne one was the first commercial unisex fragrance Citrus fresh smell. Smells good but lack of personality. More suitable for women. Clean smelling, but nothing unordinary. It’s not something that’ll bring attention, but it will make you smell nice. I like the crispness of the citrus and it’s a good casual scent Fully agree with „yourthemanowdog“. The current version smells nothing like CK One in the 90‘s when it came out. It was a pure crisp green sweet citrus. Now it‘s powdery, balsamic and nutmeg with a citrus hint. It was a revolution when it came out and the campaign pictures were very androgynous and sexy. Yes, Kate Moss was one of the models but the pictures always showed a crowd of people and were all black and white, all wearing jeans and white tank tops. CK One would organize underground parties with lots of creative crowd in Paris where I lived. It was the hipsters of the 90‘s, before the word was even invented. These days you find CK One being sold at your local drugstore where they also sell toilet paper. vitamins and hair color. I smelled it out of curiosity as I've worn it a few times 5 or 7 years ago, and it smells exactly like I remember! It's a very fresh scent, hard to dislike. It can probably fit anyone, the downside to this being that it lacks personality in my opinion. I wouldn't wear it myself but I don't think you can go wrong with it. Which is probably why it's a classic :) remember buying this at belks when it first came out in around 95 it smelled alot different back then . it was much better back then more sweeter and alot more fresher . it doesn't smell the same anymore its like a imposter now . anyways that bottle is long gone now and the vintage chrome 20 years back didn't smell like ck1 its been reformulated as well No offense, it started out veeerrry good for me, with green all in all, then.. it just smell like my father's friend, let's say it's a classic good, but I found it boring dried on my skin..
I have a very unique skin temperature, it sucks all the top notes like in the 1-2 minutes away.. to have it's top notes noticable on me is a great achievement in it's own way. For the price, I think it's a good catch for whoever love classic fresh fragrances A solid like, but definitely not a love. I like the whiff of its scent in the air, which is fresh and clean, clean, clean. But when I sniff at my wrist with my nose pretty close to my skin, the scent is slightly different - more powdery maybe? I don't know, but I remember this fragrance to be much more rounded in its edges, though perhaps it's just my memory playing tricks on me. All in all, a good fragrance for when you want to smell clean and neutral, though this smells more masculine than feminine to my nose, but it still is unisex.
EDIT: Oh my! This might get bumped up to a 'love' for me! Not as a body fragrance, though. I spritzed this on my bedsheet, blanket and pillows, and would you know it - it works wonders! Used this way, my room smells fresh and clean and I slept like a baby! So cozy and refreshing at the same time! I love it, such a full, well-rounded scent. Clean laundry and bergamot. Even for a EDT it is very weak unfortunately. Ck One smells a liitle like DG Light Blue but with a greener note. Both have a powdery blue linen scent similar to that in some I have smelt in women's deodorant. The green musk is divine though. Ck One is like a green melon, whereas Ck All is an amazingly life-like juicy rockmelon. This was the 90s cult classic fragrance, this reminds me of when i was in high school with my flannel shirts and bell bottom jeans, good times!!! I had deo spray when I was twelve. I remember only that it was named Paris-Moscow. It was green scent with citrus notes and I loved it. Unfortunately it was discontinued before year 2000. Yesterday I purchased CK-One and it was blind buy. I thought I should try this popular 90's scent. At least I think it is popular, people buy it very often from the store where I'm working. First sniff and I recognized this scent immediately, it's completely similar to Paris-Moscow. But I bet that Paris-Moscow was only cheap copy of Ck One. Fresh, green, and citrusy. Green note is quite sharp, but I like it. Great Fragrance for just smelling clean or going to the sport. It is aways in my sports bag and an easy to grab inoffensive grab. Can recommend it for this price. Classic unisex cologne. Simply one of the best! Great creation of Alberto Morillas. CK One is a really hard to hate fragrance, as I said in my CK All review, CK One (well, a cheap dupe for it) was what eased me into the world of fragrance and I will still always hold it in high regard.
I know what you're thinking and to be totally honest, I am also thinking it; what else can can be said thats not been said already?
Well, I wasn't actually a teen when this fragrance came out, so when I first smelt it, it was a whole new experience for me, it was a scent I actually wanted to smell of, clean, not overly masculine, just nice and neutral. Its a scent for people that dont like scent, dont want to wear anything olfactively challenging or just want to smell and feel clean, CK One on my skin is mostly lemon mixed with tea and cadromom, light floral accents from lily of the valley and a woody base of cedar and musk help to anchor everything into place, its vibrant, easy to wear and fresh, suitable for office wear, gym wear and so on.
Longevity is not amazing given that its a citrus based scent, but I manage to pull 5 hours from 5 sprays with a gentle ""wafty"" clean silage. Its widely available and very reasonably priced, so I'd happily buy this again, its a fail safe wardrobe staple like CK All is, spray it with abandon and enjoy! On me this is citrus and green, until the dry down, after which I am left with only a light, slightly floral musk. I like what is left after the dry down, but it doesn't rock my world. I see how this would be a ""safe"" fragrance for the office or for someone who doesn't want a lot of sillage. It is a nice, balanced scent - I can easily see why others like it. It's just not going to be a favorite for me. Nice smell, it gives me a citrusy-soap vibe like if you just got out of a bath. Not a good performing fragance but also you can get big bottles very cheap. Worth the money if you use this to enjoy it by yourself. The fragrance I received from my girlfriend on our anniversary. Ran through a 200 ml in 2 years. To me, this is a hall of fame beautiful, clean, sexy scent that just makes me happy. This scent smells like a garden. Not as citrusy as people say, mostly all I can smell from this fragrance is florals. Cheap and worth the money for sure though. This was groundbreaking in the beginning of the 90's. The thought of mixing ""male"" and ""female"" accords into a scent was somehow very bold, coming out of the 80's with power suits and Venice beach bodies...
It's not bold, of course, but still just a great fragance from that era. It was my signature for all thoose years from 94-99, i had just one perfume for day, night, spring, fall, etc, and it was CK.
My friends all said i was a poster boy for the metrosexual kid, growing up playing guitar in a rock band, dropping out of higher education, rather wanna travel the world, meet people, seeing countries, etc. There was nothing like the ""scent of the day"" and all that stuff. No collections of fragances, no office to go to, everything i had was two suitcases with clothes and a guitar and....my CK-bottle. 
My taste changed over the years. Citrus is not something i reach for when i choose a perfume, not as a dominant accord if you now what i mean. That doesn´t mean it´s boring or whatever, no. But today i need a bit more deep and complex blends to go crazy over a scent.
But make no mistake: CK is minimalism at it's best. It's a must try for all of us. Clean sheets, and later...dirty minds....
8/10
Instagram: @a_fraghags_tale I never tried CK One in the 90s as a little child, but this is a familiar scent. It doesn’t really smell of a spray type fragrance. It just smells soapy and clean. It’s a shower fresh smell. The citrus in this is pretty tame just the way I like it. 
It gets pretty light on the skin quickly after spraying. I’m not sure if I’d be able to identify this fragrance as a person wearing an edt vs someone just stepping out of the shower. Also, I can agree it is unisex because it smells like basic soap. However, I think I’d have a hard time convincing my male friends and family members to try it out. I would think they would say it smells too feminine leaning based on comments they have made on other fragrances. I hadn't smelled this in ages and got an itch to revisit it. Unfortunately, the shipping box was damaged and the perfume leaked. Wow, the box was aromatic. We're having some renovations at our house, and the construction crew all recognized it. And everyone remembered how much they liked it.
It's not the most complex thing going, but ckone is a great summer freshy. CK One opens up with citrus, then dries down to a musky and green scent. The only downside is it is a little bit synthetic. I would recommend this fragrance for teenagers/young adults who want to start a fragrance collection. Cheap, versatile, and everybody will love it. 
Scent: 7.5/10
Longevity: 7/10
Versatility: 8/10
Value: 9/10 Very safe and very minimalistic in its citrusy and clean tones. Not a favourite, too bland. Very groundbreaking though as many followed the trend of similar scents. You can't really say anything bad about this. It's fresh, zingy and very citrus without smelling like Lemon Pledge.
I'd say it's unisex, but leaning more on the masculine side potentially.
It's summer in a bottle and a staple in my collection.
Wouldn't use for an evening or a night out, unless I'm backpacking and haven't brought anything more expensive for the fear of losing it, having it stolen or damaged.
Wouldn't buy it as a gift either.
Can't go wrong! A safe blind-purchase. Smells like green soap. I compared it to Acqua di Gio,as they have the same parfumer. AdG smells a lot better and also have better longevity. As for unisex it definately is,smells quite feminine also. Clean and fresh. I wasn't a teen yet in the 90s but this scent worked for me in '16-17 and will continue to work for a lot of people until the end of time. Of course there's nothing new to it anymore. I just wish they make it last a lot longer even if it's too late I remember when this fragrance launched. My local mall distributed 3mL sample vials in a brushed metal packaging. I remember smelling it and really liking it. I never got around to getting my own bottle in the 90's because my best friend at the time thought it reeked and preferred Calvin Klein's Escape. Of course, my friend's opinions were always way more important back then!
I scored a free bottle in 2010, and I've worn it on and off since then. The smell of CKone is a very distinct one, but it's not one that I want to smell of anymore. I wish I had enjoyed it back in the 90's and left it there. I still think it's a pleasant smell, but it's a little too ""cold"" and sharp for my personal tastes. I think I'll use it up as a room spray. Calvin Klein CK One Unisex EDT opens with a moderate projection of mostly citrus and green accords. The opening is soft, unisex, fresh, common, and OK. The sharpness of the citrus notes is noticeable but short-lived, the fragrance develops a soft musky and powdery note, resulting from the musk, violet, and amber. The green notes are soft but noticeable, a fresh, grassy, greenery note. The musky note grows as time passes, the floral notes also become noticeable and the resulting scent leans to white florals creating a slight feminine touch. The fragrance contains several other notes, but they are not prominent, they come up as a faint fruity, spicy, and woody touch. The fragrance has one noticeable opening to dry-down change, the citrus notes dominate the opening and are very sharp, but that changes quickly, these citrus notes get enveloped by a powdery, musky, and projecting accord, simultaneously, the floral notes come up and become noticeable and the initial moderate projection takes one step down to low. Once Calvin Klein CK One Unisex EDT has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a soft projection, slightly sweet, musky powdery, green, citrus, and white floral fragrance with woody accords. The fragrance feels airy, breezy, casual, delicate, diluted, diurnal, dry, elegant, faint, feminine, floral, fresh, green, light, modern, musky, short-lived, slightly sour, sporty, unisex, white, and pleasant.

The fragrance feels airy, breezy, casual, delicate, diluted, diurnal, dry, elegant, faint, feminine, floral, fresh, green, light, modern, musky, short-lived, slightly sour, sporty, unisex, white, and pleasant. CK One is a good bathroom freshener OmegaLUL 2020 and hands down in that no other fragrance tackles lemon quite like CK One.. everyone else’s lemon comes across like wood cleaners.. It is no longer a smell as before. as if something has changed in content Very 90s. Like, Leonardo and Claire Danes probably wore this in the 1996 Romeo & Juliet. It's that 90s. If you were around back then you likely remember the marketing. As a result it's very familiar to a lot of people now. 
It's a ""fresh"" fragrance. I get equal parts ""citrus-y,"" equal party ""flower-y."" Consistent with the unisex designation, it gives me an androgynous vibe. On me it dries down more or less as it goes on, stays fruity/floral throughout. 
Silliage is fair. Longevity is moderate. My skin absorbs colognes pretty fast. I'd say with this one I get 5-5.5 hours max, usually more like 4+. I spray it pretty liberally, 5-8 sprays, and still that's all I get. 
I rarely if ever get comments on this one way or another. Maybe because it's so ubiquitous and generic now. Given what 80s scents were like, I can see how it was a shift in the 90s, but now seems run of the mill. Good for warmer weather in spring-summer. 
I never go wrong wearing this as a 30s male. It's inoffensive and doesn't stand out, leaves you smelling fresh. But I don't get many compliments on it either. Way too floral and feminine for my taste.
Overall a pleasant scent, but this has been copied so so so much that everyone has some kind of memory associated with this type of scent.
Smells nothing like Chrome or Paco.
Performance is dismal. 
There are better scents even from CK right about now. No need to get this in my mind.
It is a bit dated for sure. This has a light citrusy smell, which kind of reminds me of the fresh soapy smell after a shower. It's not a bad scent but I wouldn't recommend this one as the smell is very faint, doesn't project, and doesn't last long. Longevity 7/10
Sillage 7/10
Projection 7/10
Performance 7/10
Price 10/10 I remember loving this when it first came out, and that it was my signature scent back in the late 90s. So, it was a very happy surprise for me when I found a 5mL bottle in amongst some old boxes I was going through. 
Well, either my nose has completely changed or the bottle has, because it doesn't smell anything like I remember! 
I remember it as citrus-heavy and bright, and very green and fresh. Leaning toward the ""masculine"" side. Now, I perceive it as very soapy, and more feminine. I still get citrus in the opening, but it's nothing to write home about. 
I definitely wouldn't buy it again, and instead will remember it fondly from my younger days. Smells amazing but doesn't last. it is feminine so I don't know why it is marketed as unisex My first fragrance, bought it back in 1997. I still own it, mostly for nostalgic reasons, and wear it from time to time. I don't think the smell is dated, it's just a fresh citrus fragrance that will offend no one. Timeless classic! Ah CK One. Considered to be a bit of a classic. I remember smelling this back in the days and thinking it smelled quite fresh. Bought a bottle lately for pizza money, figured out it would be a nice enough summer scent. Well sometimes buying perfume on the basis of a quick paper strip test is a form of gambling. Chalk it up as a loss.
CK One starts off with some damp citrus and fruity notes with a muted feminine floral array lurking underneath. There is something familiar about it. The image that slowly materializes is that this smells like Acqua Di Gio for men who wear handbags. I mean I do have one too but only carry really manly shit in it like booze, cigars, vintage Playboys, steaks, big dogs and power tools.
I can't shake the impression that CK One smells like a watered down feminine perfume that is too boring to make anyone more alluring unless you live in a place where there is no running water. You might say it extends the coming out of the shower feeling but to me you will just smell like a person who doesn't know how to properly rinse off the soap you goddamn dummy. It smells cheap and barely fresh in a way that suggest a common household product.
Wish I bought that pizza. Pizza is truly unisex and smells better. There is a new place here that sells Italian style pizza, dude was in Italy for four months WOW! I put on CK One when I started to write this review and now it is just a boring hum. I recommend getting a decent citrus cologne over this. It is a bad perfume, an eau that belongs in the toilet. Zero points and five poopy emojis is my final verdict.
P.S. The shower gel is also bad. I mean it is a functional product and (probably) gets the Corona particles out of your bosom and bum but the structure is crap and using it makes me feel like a Barbie house is waiting behind the bathroom door when I get done with the joyless scrubbing. It smells like plastic and gives me nightmares of spending the rest of my life quarantined alone with a blowup doll. I'll save it for special occasions like when I have food poisoning or something equally disastrous. I expected it to be a lemon scented fragrance. It's not. Opening is synthetic, bergamot like. It morphs into something a little spicy like an orange peel mixed with some cedar or cardamom, or both. Very 90's. Safe blind gift perfume. Not exciting, slightly interesting. We used an old bottle as a bathroom spray growing up. No idea how that came to pass, but certainly worked better than an air freshener. (To paraphrase The Boys in the Band: ""It smelled like puke. Now it smells like someone puked in a gardenia patch."") Totally inoffensive, but if your first reaction is ""family friend's restroom"" there might be a good reason for that! I normally don't like citrus but I blind bought this and it turned out to be the frag I've gravitated to most this summer. Fresh and sweet. Then I remembered my highschool bf used to wear this long long ago and on him it smelled quite different. It's a fresh yellow kind of scent. Happy, perky and ready :)) 2019 batch; Zero projection, and very poor longevity. The opening smells nice, other than that, there's nothing good to be said about this fragrance. Regarding longevity complaints... A friend applied two sprays on me. On the next day it was still very, very present. Unless his bottle is super old (higher quality?), personally I don't see any reason to complain. This was my high school fragrance lol I loved wearing this. I haven't smelled this since then and am interested to see what I think of now. From what I remember, a nice clean scent. Nothing more, nothing less. Super minimalist that you really cannot go wrong with the scent. The longevity is questionable but for the price it really is a good staple fragrance. This would be an easy reach that is not super loud. Perfectly unisex. I can’t stress this enough, the fragrance is terrible but the lotion is a masterpiece. The lotion lasts, projects and gets compliments EVERY time I wear it. So fresh, clean and sexy. Best $10 spent in 2019. I agree with everything said in the last review....except I do feel strongly about it lol. It has been both my husband’s and my casual, daily go to fragrance since the mid nineties. On a boiling hot July evening in 1995, by coincidence, we both wore it on our first date. It has been to holiday destinations all over the world from Barbados to Australia and several seaside resorts in the uk. It has been on honeymoon, we have made and given birth to babies wearing it! When our daughter was younger she used to love wearing it. It is probably the only perfume in the world that is ok for a 40 year old man to wear while taking his 5 year old daughter to Sunday School, wearing the same fragrance it is that versatile lol. and for that reason it will always be a staple inside our bathroom cabinet. I hesitated to write a review of this. How can you review air? Or water? This is the most inobtrusive and universal fragrance I know. Never headache inducing, never cloying, never dirty. The downside to it is that it is very nondescript. But sometimes it is exactly what you need. Normcore and preppy. Of course I like CK One. It is not an option to not like it. But do I feel strongly about it? No. I'm loving the fresh, clean smell of citrus. It feels amazing to wear this after taking a shower. This is very suitable to use as an everyday fragrance due to it not being offending. Sadly, it only lasts for 1 hour on my skin. I received a bottle of CK All from a generous Fragrantican today, and I wore that for a bit. I wanted to compare it against this, which I have smelled frequently though the years (usually on men), because I ALSO received a bonus complimentary decant of this when I ordered something else. So it's been a good old fashioned CK spree for me, all for free, and thanks to the kindness of other fragheads <3
This has always been a slightly masculine, soapy green scent. The citrus is pretty tart and bordering on bitter in the opening (not a criticism, I love it), and it's a perfect out-of-the-shower scent. It's a classic piece at this time, and I do truly feel that it can be worn by all. It evokes fresh, cool air, clean white Tshirts, sunlight and springtime. Without the note pyramid to help, it's green lily of the valley with bergamot. On me, it lasts about 3 hours and wood with musk remains.
There's nothing very sweet in here (my nose fails to get thr pineapple), but it's inoffensive and stays on a moderate leash, and could easily be worn to the gym or to casual things. It's nostalgic in all the right reasons, and wonderfully tomboyish. SMELL 6/10
Clean, fresh, soft, quiet, soapy. Initially it's not bad, very citrusy and floreal but i don't like dry-down. 
PERFORMANCE 5/10
Weak sillage for about 2 hours, then becomes a skin scent for a few hours while it lasts longer on clothes.
UNIQUENESS 6/10
BOTTLE 6/10
SEASONS Spring/Summer
CONTEXT Casual, sporting, formal
VALUE FOR MONEY Right I have no idea what all these things are on the pyramid. Grant it I have an older batch but it doesn’t really smell off so maybe it’s not accurate but I get a fresh Citrus blast at the beginning, kind of like a more masculine and mature version of Canoe then it recedes into a soapy, lavender smell.it is very fresh and pleasing but it doesn’t seem to last very long and isn’t too complex. Again maybe my batch has lost some of its muster since it’s old but I really just get soapy lavender and some citrus. It isn’t bad at all but not entirely complex either. I think since it’s flowery it’s more suited for the spring time instead of summer One of the best fragrances ever. I love this. Puts me in a harmonious mood. Smells young, summery, sensual and fresh. Light, clean, and a true classic. This is the type of scent that works for any occasion at anytime. Both men and woman will love the clean, fresh and citrus scent. It appeals to almost all people and wears very nicely for those looking for a light and everyday scent. Nice generic soapy fragrance. Soap water. It’s very clean and fresh. Not something I would bother trying to smell like everyday though. it’s so generic, it does have more performance than its predecessor ‘CK Be’ which has negative zero performance. on my skin anyway. I wouldnt rave about this one or even spend more than 10$ on. Try Ck Shock or Ck One Goldfish Lasting and projection of this scent is amazing only if you have a 90s Edition.....all the Coty editions are crap This is a safe everyday scent. To me it’s more masculine and I usually spray my man with it, when I wear it is just a fresh scent. 
Weak projection, doesn’t last longer than couple of hours . My boyfriend used to wear this and has finished multiple bottles of it. To me, it's a cool, fresh fragrance but it was nothing spectacular. When I'm at work a lot of male customers come in wearing CK One or when I'm out and about I can also smell CK One on a lot of men that pass me by. It's a very common fragrance so you won't smell unique or turn heads when wearing this but it's inoffensive and good for office or school. I very much prefer CK Eternity on my boyfriend as that's not as common anymore. I dont find it similar to Azzaro Chrome at all, I dont know how that is possible so many ppl do, but whatever... For me what is importnant that on me it is such a fresh citrus-musk-violet smell. Not very intensive but lasting, close to the skin. I love some of the later flankers of the same line too, especially the recent ones. I love this perfume, i really do but due to its poor sillage i prefer azzaro chrome these days CK ONE is another 90s nostalgic scent. I keep a bottle in my collection because I like to smell it from time to time. It is fresh, clean and cool and a true unisex scent. I knew guys and girls who wore this back in the day. A classic in my books. This defines the 90s scent wise to me. Love the smell but longevity is less than poor!! Just a suggestion if u want the same accords but with 5 hrs longevity try Cologne
Belcam Gender One Eau De Toilette Spray it’s like 10 bucks at Walmart lol. A lot of cosmetic/beauty supplies mimic this scent and a lot of stores use this as an ambient scent. So, trust me when I say this, you have definitely smelled this at some point in your life whether you're 10, 20, or 50.
It's essentially a really soft and clean citrusy-floral scent with a slight sweetness to it which resembles that found in certain body lotions - mostly women's lotions.
Having said that, this is 100% unisex but more feminine-leaning and easier to pull off for a woman due to that creamy-sweet lotion nuance. I get citrus in the beginning and a little bit of tea in the dry down. Other than that it’s straight up 2000s freshie, loaded up with artificial greenery. It’s totally unisex, simplistic to the point of forgettable, and casual. Moderate longevity and close to skin sillage. Simply beautiful, non-cloying citrus-floral combo freshie. The citrus part is a cocktail of bright fruits, whilst the floral chord is subtle but gives the perfume a serious differential to everything that ever existed before and everything that still exists today in terms of open citruses. Perfect super hot summer frag. On the shelf of monstrous commercial successes of Morillas (alongside indisputable Acqua di Gio and 212 NYC), it asserts itself, in my judgment, as the most balanced of them and an eternal must-have in any good smelling closet, be it for the absurd high quality and excellent result for designer standards, be it for the great performance for the freshie proposal, be it for the absurdly inviting price tag. It definitely leans more toward feminine... The Rose is quite strong in this one. It could just be my bottle though. I still enjoy this fragrance a lot though. It doesn't project very well, but with enough sprays (10 for me) I can get about 6 hours of good performance. Solid scent. Will definitely purchase a bigger bottle when I run out. With the purchase. This is lovely. It's a nice daytime perfume, moderately lasting on skin and clothes, but if you reapply it, it's still inoffensive, it's fresh but not sharp. More for women than men.
I am 28, I see it as the perfect perfume for my age. I don't see it fitting a 17 year old. 
Such a good combination of notes. Smells very soapy and clean, like you've just got out of a fresh shower. Is not really catchy or mesmerizing, so if you're trying to wear a fragrance to make you more sexy, it wouldn't be the best choice. In fact, one might just assume you just got out of the shower, and that's what you smell like.
However, it does smell very pleasant, it's very discrete, very long lasting for me as well, I'm not sure why it has such bad votes on longevity, it's lasting for over 7 hours on my skin.
It's unisex, because the ""fresh"" smell you get from it, doesn't really have anything masculine or feminine in it, it's just... clean. 
Clean is really the one word you can use to sum up this whole fragrance, and the perception people are going to get for you when they smell it on you.
Overall, nothing too crazy, but considering how cheap it is and the performance, I'd rate it a strong 7/10. Very good for casual summer/spring occasions when you just want to boost your overall appeal without going to obvious about it. I love this fragrance. Is it smell similar to light blue by Dolce and Gabbana? Anyway, I love both of them. Light, clean, classic and the perfect unisex fragrance. This is the type of scent that works for any occasion at anytime. It is simple enough that it works as a great present for men and women of all ages. Some men may find it to be too sweet and feminine, but the scent is the definition of minimalism but it still comes across as a fresh and modern, even today. Very Light and Pleasant that everyone will like. Not super amazing but always does the job regardless of setting. More of a fragrance you would wear if you DONT want to wear anything strong/attention catching. I used CK One for 10 years and I'm sure at least 50 strangers, from every gender and orientation, approached and asked me what this amazing smell was. While sitting in a cafe, waiting on a line, in elevator, people even stopped me while I was walking down the street. I remember one elderly female neighbor instantly hugged me with closed eyes while uttering ""ooo my good this smells perfect"". I also remember that when I changed my perfume to something else, several of my friends got upset because they couldn't smell it anymore. Either it goes perfectly with my skin or CK one is magical. It lasted on my skin for days even after a bath, and it even lasted longer on my clothes even after washing. If it doesn't last on your skin, it could be caused by two things: first, your skin may be too dry. Dry skin doesn't hold perfume well, so make sure your skin is hydrated. Second, your batch could be old. I couldn't find the magic of CK One in other perfumes. Still searching. For me this starts as a musky water scent and then dries down to a spicy clean scent. It is a nice timeless unisex which is usually what I prefer for office use or a middle of the day refresher. Back in the day I would wear men's scents like Obsession because they worked better with my skin chemistry and I prefer a warmer scent over a flowery scent. I like that CK One is different on everyone who wears it. I have the body wash, too, and it matches the spray perfectly. I really love ck one and have never smelled anything similar. It’s citrus and aquatic. Lea say citriquatic. It lasts on me. Strictly for summer. it's a nice gluey citrus scent leading into some pleasant florals, and a very light ambery spicy base deep down in the base.
Most fragrances I have are more complex, provocative, enticing, musky, earthy etc, but sometimes, simple and easy is nice, and what I am looking for at the moment.
I never wore this, or thought it would be interesting at all when I saw those ads when it first came out, and lemon scents are not really my interest, but this one is not really a yellow lemon.
What I like about this one is it smells pretty good for what it is, for one - its not an aquatic (the genre I dislike the most for scent).
This one has a almost gluey smell of citrus and some florals which come in and they are pleasant. There is a very light amber and spice in the base. It actually smells pretty good for a simple easy going scent, with some soft interesting light complexity.
I tried it a few times at the store, and got myself a bottle. this perfume is a very fresh citrusy perfume i really love it but does not last long, you have to respray at the middle of ur day. 3 words: Fresh, summer, 90's Yes, another 90s person is here to say this is an iconic fragrance. I was a freshman in high school when it came out. I lived in a fairly large city with fairly small town, narrow minded attitudes. I was the only kid into Britrock and elephant flares, tiny band t-shirts and whatever skate sneaker was around. I wasn't into grunge, I was a girl who wanted to be someone between Liam Gallagher (i even had my cut my hair like him) and Louise Wener, with a heavy Smiths obsession. I was not considered cool in my city, but strange and moody. I wanted not to be there. This scent, along with a fantastic music collection, courtesy of my 10 yrs older AOL chat buddy/symbolically adopted older brother from Chicago, helped transport me and let me escape.
I had one local BFF and all we did (could do) was sit at the mall and people watch. One time some jocks from school got in a fight practically on top of us and got blood all over the Smiths denim jacket my grandma had custom made me. My BFFs mom hand washed it for me in her bathtub, and joked that she almost got high from the stench of CK One emanating from the hot water!
lol I will always remember that.
I own a mini bottle, so far just for nostalgically sniffing - - the sense memories of the quite dark emotional turmoil of that time make me hesitant to actually wear it.
However, there is no denying that it's a magnificent citrus scent that has aged amazingly well. You will obviously have memories attached to it if you grew up with it... Again, in my city, kids were NOT into this. It was considered for freaks and weirdos, or maybe older junkie types. So, for me, it is MY scent, not the scent of a generation.
I am a bit of a masochist about purposely putting myself into memories that weren't that good (of course, i love positive nostalgia just as much, though!), so I hope to always have a bottle of this to sniff and remember the magic of blasting Oasis albums by myself in the living room when my parents went out, wishing i were somewhere much cooler. 
If you don't have any memories attached to it, then just try it - - it is a truly unique scent and they DID nail the unisex thing. Personally, I think it's a shame to dismiss it solely because of its age or nostalgia, because when totally removed of any concepts, it's just a very confident and fresh scent that i dont find similar to anything else. Although young people may sometimes fall for a good ad campaign, I find it hard to believe it would've been THAT ubiquitous in most places based purely on some hot models. I mean look at my city: the ad campaign was why it was UNpopular! The fact is it was a widely appealing scent then and I think it still is now. CK One is the most compatible green perfume for extra summer days IMHO. Very nice and clean and does the job whenever you wear it. It lasts 6+ hours and projects good during the firs 4 hours for me When this was first released, I remember it being a unique classy scent. 
Clean and fresh. Silage is perfect and longevity is good. It lasts a long time, then slowly fades.
Perfect for lunch dates in the middle of summers heat.
Then on to a yuppie nightclub, where all the guys who wear this, drive European convertibles.
I love this scent, and everything it illuminates........
But only for summer. Yes, this for me is a summer essential. I get the citrus, green, woody notes. But I love that I also get clear floral notes. This is a really beautiful clean floral. A just showered, clean laundry kind of scent. There is a bit of sweetness but it's not a sweet perfume. I like it for the spring to summer seasons. It will appeal to most people yet doesn't seem generic. It may have come out of the 90s but it's not outdated by any means. This one is still very current and a good staple to have in your collection for the warmer months. The most basic perfume. It works well as a gift if you don't know what the person you're giving it to likes. Yes, it is inoffensive and clean but ordinary.To my nose it doesn't smell bad, but a tad boring. 
6.5/10 This fragrance is citrus, green and fresh ideal for hot days although its wake is not very good, I would consider it good for women and young men from 18 to 25 years because I think that for more adulthood it can become feminine
I am a teenager and girls like it when I use it daily to go to high school on very hot days I disagree withe comments describing this as clean and fresh. 
Yes, there is a refreshing quality in it due to the citrus, but to my nose, it feels like there is something deep, dark and sexy that lurks behind this 'fresh, clean' façade. 
For some reason whenever I sniff this, it strikes me as deeply erotic. Musky, intriguing, seductive. There is a 'bad girl'/ 'bad guy' vibe in this perfume. Whoever wears it, needs to have confidence, charisma and sex appeal. Sort of a 'I don't care, I know I'm sexy' sort of attitude, without it being arrogant or over the top. 
A firm favourite during my teenage years and early twenties, I'll always remember this scent fondly. This is very complimented cheap and really fresh fragrance. Really unisex. This is not an old or dated fragrance, and i explain why : if you are young, your friends do not know this fragrance, and for them it is still new! when i use ck one nobody can say which perfum i am wearing! only compliments! this is a masterpiece, very sublime. CK One is still nice, safe but IMO, it is out of dated - just like CK Eternity. Buy CK All if you want a same price, same quality, same kind of scent but belongs to the present. I agree with everything the review below said, so fresh, so clean, so perfect for when you are in your #mycalvins. iconic game-changing staple fragrance that is a must in anyone's collections. So clean, so classy, so nineties. This is that fresh out of the shower, crisp, citrusy goodness which feels absolutely made for a woman in a white shirt and Calvin Klein underwear.
It's been my work perfume for years because it's so pleasant and fresh. It transforms into a light skin scent that compliments deodorant and fresh clothes perfectly.
I've also had compliments from men on this perfume, despite it not being particularly feminine. On a warm night, CK One smells different - lemony and green and androgynous.
It's gorgeous, but if you're after something overtly sexy, feminine or sweet it won't be for you. It never became my signature for this reason - I just craved something a little sweeter and creamier. I really like this perfume. Smells very fresh I like to use it after shower it's refreshing clean citrusy creamy the Smell look like nivea creme with lemon I don't put it outside because it's not long lasting I use it only in home This transports me back to freshman year in high school [1994-1995] when I wore original Levi's 501 and classic Airwalk sneakers. Any time I want to smell as cool as I once was, I revisit this classic unisex frag.
Fresh, citrus, subtly spicy and floral. On my boyfriend the spice and floral is more pronounced and smells amazing. 
This one can go south if your skin rejects it with nasty body odor smell, most likely attributed to the cardamom. Luckily, it's not the case for everyone.
Worth a try - especially at the affordable price. CLASSIC & NOSTALGIC I like this, don't care if it was feminine. 
I wear what I like.
Pleasant citrus and floral, I get 1-2hrs soft projection and then skin scent for about 3-4hrs.
First impression meh, weird smell.
It grows on me after a few wearing, or maybe I'm bored with sauvage/aventus/invictus trend.
Very basic for everyday use on hot weather.
Rating: 7.5/10.
I like this. Very fresh scent- on me it opens with green and citrus notes..after 2 hours some powdery notes appear but it is still fresh...after 4 hours since first application I start to feel a metalic smell..which lasts a good 6-8 hours.. at this stage I do not feel the green or fresh notes anymore..just traces of metallic smell.. 
But, despite this,I like it, but will be not rebuying it due to poor longevity.( or perhaps I do not feel it, as people around me are commenting about the fresh and nice trail of smell I leave behind) 🙂. 
Nice to have if you want a neutral smell. Good for office environment . 
Few months back I found a good dupe, with better sillage and longevity at Pull and Bear..it is called "" Soft Canvas "" ,but I think it was discontinued since I cannot find it on their site anymore. Never understood a floral like this being called ""inoffensive"". Smelled many different bottles of this because I was convinced the first one I had smelled had gone bad. To me it comes off as mildewy. Really dislike all versions of this whether its the original, Azzaro Chrome or any other clone. Fantastic and revolutionary scent, though a tad too feminine for me these days (30 year old male). A refreshing and light spring and summer scent, it’s inoffensive, clean, and was truly revolutionary when it was first released, it’s hard not to enjoy it based on this merit alone! One of the best scents from CK, and still stands the test of time. While some CK scents get really boring and played out, for some reason this one doesn’t. It grows on you (example: I absolutely loved Euphoria when I first smelled it, and disliked ck one. Now I love CK one and dislike Euphoria, strange but true!).
If you are a guy and find this one a touch too feminine, try CK All! I find it to be quite a bit better than CK one, in terms of scent, longevity and projection, and it’s more masculine to my nose.
7/10! If you had a childhood in the 90's - buy this!
If you're born after 1995, avoid this like hell. You'll never understand it.
Best way I can describe this in modern terms is Versace Pour Homme's retarded little cousin. 20-30 mins and its gone from your skin even after 4 sprays. Terrible, terrible projection. Absolutely no sillage. I put 7 sprays before going to the grocery store just to smell nice, back less than 25 mins later and already no trace of it.
So, if you're looking for a signature scent, a main daily scent? Forget it. Stay away.
If you're looking to expand your collection by adding something just for the fun of it? Sure, why no.
If you're into nostalgia, like me, this is a cheap fragrance so why not. I bought it just to have it, because it reminds me of those days we got VHS tapes and audio casettes of Michael Jackson, Backstreet Boys, Spice Girls. That old party scent. Here's for the good times, the ""old"" times.
P.S. - In modern times, this scent is an exact reason of why Fragrantica should add something between Like and Dislike, called 'Tolerable/Able to tolerate'. “Fresh fabric softener, with a floral vibe”
A true masterpiece. Not expected by a brand like CK, but this is a to - go fragrance, fitting literally with any event; very versatile.
It’s super cheap for what it is, being worth a lot more than it actually costs for what it is.
This is my everyday fragrance. I get compliments with this probably more than some 100 dollars fragrances.
Beautiful.
Scent 8/10
Sillage 7/10
Performance 6/10 Two words: Fresh laundry. If you like the smell of fresh laundry, this is the fragrance for you. 
Initially, this has one of the best, citrus openings you will ever smell. It should only be applied under 25 degrees Celcius otherwise it begins to smells bitter and horrible. After the citrus opening dries down it smells exactly like fresh, clean laundry. Its a nice, fresh smell, don't over do it with the sprays though or it will give you a headache. 
Unfortunately the perofmrnace of this is poor, lasts about 30 minutes to1 hour, so don't spend a shiny penny on it. Nice. Smells like flowers and lemon up top and has a musky undertone, can even pass off as a little feminine. Lasts for about 3 to 4 hours on the skin. A good fragrance to have, can splash this on before heading to the gym, going to the grocers, running random errands etc.
Overall rating: 6/10 Very fresh fragrance that everyone should own. This is something you throw on when you're not sure what to wear. It's very good in all occasions, almost all year round. It's very cheap but certainly doesn't smell like it So agree with frag addict below OK, so I'll post the 537th review of this modern classic - 
which I only now tried out for the first time. What can I say?
My first thought was ""Hm. Boring. Smells just like soap.""
Now, seeing that this came out in 1994, I should acknowledge
that it has aged remarkably well. At the time, it must have been
quite innovative: Fresh, subtle, unisex, it showed that perfumes
didn't have to be overpowering, in-your-face ""masculine""
(whatever that means) in the style of Kouros, Drakkar Noir etc. in
order to be elegant. 
It is hard to dislike this. In an alignment chart of fragrances,
this one is ""True Neutral"". It's not the kind of scent that you
immediately fall in love with, either. ""Clean"" and ""inoffensive"" 
are words other reviewers have used to describe it. True, that.
It smells just like soap. Everyone used to wear this in the 1990s; the cleanest, most watery but citric and wonderfully androgynous smell. Easily dismissed today as a cliché that inspired the contemporary fascination with all things lemon for men, but that's unfair. CK One was an icon of its time. It came in an iconic bottle with a delicate little silver top and was the scent that drew me into the fragrance world. I wouldn't wear it now as it's too light and summery for me, but on a teenager it would still work great!
Update, May 2019: My local pharmacy has been selling 200ml bottles for £20. I had forgotten just how good, how fresh and endearing this was. I couldn't resist a sniff and, by surprise, it doesn't seem as light as I remember. A reminder of good, fun times. I'm in love again. Yes, I bought it! Omg...smelled this on someone at a pet expo today. Brings back memories from the 90s! We were so hopeful then lol. Nice, truly unisex green tea+ citrus. Both myself and boyfriend's have worn it. Good times. Kate Moss and Marky Mark. I think it was 4 bottles I got for Christmas the year this hit and I loved it. A mix of citrus, rain and NYC. Oddly enough, I just get a huge blast of muguet with faintly lemony facets to it when I spritz it on my skin, as compared to the dewy lemon that the notes above seem to suggest. It's not unpleasant, but I'm not sure if my sample has changed with age... This one, along with Paco, are my dumb reaches for summer hot days when I go out for a walk or to do chores. Very fresh, clean scent. One word: FRESH. My go to for summer or warm SoCal days. I think fondly of a scent memory, of when I first tried this in the mall that was attached to a movie theater, when I went to see the movie Little Women with Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Kirsten Dunst, etc. in '94. All in all, a great scent that I think most people will like if they're into fresh smells. i was impressed when i tried it... it is really refreshing citrusy/orange perfume. High versatiliy but i get impressed about longevity, it is not that weak how i am reading here. It's difficult to find better refreshing perfumes, this is 100% pleasant, for summer it runs great! Really beautifully put together scent that’s prettty basic and safe and not exactly a favorite of mine but it’s a scent I’ll always have in my collection.
This opens up very soapy,citrusy, bright and with some florals and in the opening it’s quite feminine for my liking but as thisdries down it does become more unisex. This heads into the drydown pretty quick and this scent doesn’t change much but as it develops CK One gets more creamy,smooth but at the same time more musky as well. If this wasn’t as musky this scent would be an easy love and not a like. In the drydown this becomes perfectly unisex as it’s simply afresh,out of the shower,creamy soap type of smell. Very pleasant but can be boring pretty quick.
This is also compared to Chrome and I can definitely see the comparison. The differences being are that the metallic note and apple in Chrome help it to be more bold and masculin.
Performance- people on here are saying this doesn’t perform but on my skin I get 4-6 hours with decent projection actually. This also leaves a lovely scent trail !
Overall rating-7 out of 10 ! Nothing amazing but it is a good,refreshing pick me up scent when you just want to smell clean. This is perfectly unisex and fresh, with a slightly sweet drydown. It's a great ""safe"" fragrance for any man and any woman who can appreciate a fresh scent. I went through a couple of bottles of this years ago. CK One is the ultimate 'easy grab' fragrance for anyone of any age and in almost any situation, which makes it such a perfect choice as a gift, no doubt this is why it's still around after all these years. 
There's nothing shocking or indeed stunning about this scent but it's...nice! Refreshing, comforting, clean, lightly spicy, floral, citrusy and slightly sweet. 
I tried this recently at a duty free and seven plus hours later, despite twice washing my hands I could still smell it as a skin scent. It's not very strong beyond the first 3O minutes or so though, still a timeless fragrance in a similar way to CK Be (although 'Be' is even softer!). its ok and fresh but so weak on me that its sad. CK One is a clean, fresh, floral fragrance perfect for spring and summer. On my skin CK One starts of with a blast of freshness. Bergamot, mandarin and green notes stand out at the top. As the green notes settle down, a sparkling and sweet lemon note comes through. The fragrance then turns floral as the sweet lemon note takes a back seat and the white flowers come through. I smell the freesia and the lily of the valley. The fragrance stays that way for a couple of hours before the base comes through. The base is soft musky, woody and powdery. Very light and comforting. The fragrance has a great silage and stays on my skin for four hours or so.
CK One is a unisex fragrance which can be pulled off by men and women of any age group. I love wearing CK One when it is a casual day at work or on easy going weekends in spring summer when I am spending time out doors. CK One by Calvin Klein is a modern classic fragrance, one that I remember as a middle school student walking the halls to get to my locker and my next class. It always seemed to be present and a breath of fresh air. It is a bouncy, soft and clean citrus composition reminiscent of cloud nine. It had no gender I designated to it, then and now. CK One, being a perfect unisex fragrance, stands precisely in the middle where the two sexes harmoniously meet. Fresh citrusy floral... pretty unisex by week performance... reminds me creed silver Mountain WATER and also some vibes of aqua Di Gio .... ok for spring and summer...
For more reviews please check out my YouTube channel: Mehdi Scent The description of the fragrance sounds so lovely and interesting I wish that is what I experienced. I find the citrus smell overpowers everything and feels like a punch in the nose. Instead of a complex fragrance all I get is a citrus sensation that is painful, like a sniff of ammonia. 
In the 90s my university campus was a thick cloud of CK One in the heat of summer and I held my breath whenever someone wearing CK jeans walked past. I like the freshness of this fragrance when first applied, but find it doesn't last long, and needs a respray every few hours. Smells good, but performs relatively poorly. I have to smell my shirt to remember it's there rather fast. My wife pointed it out and I started noticing it really smells like Irish Spring. Definitely lemony too. This is something I would like if I sprayed it and kept smelling it on me all day, but I don't.
Buy Again? If it's really really cheap - Like 10 bucks I might. I would have to impulse buy it at a store though.
Smell 3/5
Performance 2/5 This, overall, is fresh and clean with some bit of spiciness. Every time I have it on, I feel like I just stepped out of a shower (where I used a lemon-cardamom based shower gel), then put on freshly washed and conditioned clothes. Quite refreshing especially on a hot day. Plus, there's something timeless about this fragrance, like it will never run out of style. I must say, I quite enjoy CK One!
The opening is heavy on the citruses. I mostly get lemon and bergamot, and a ""juicy sweetness"" from the pineapple, though I am sure mandarin is somewhere in the mix as well. It's also a little green and bitter in the background. Quite interesting, but I am sure I could get other scents that would give me a similar effect (Shiseido Zen, I am looking at you).
The development is where things get interesting. I still get the strong citrus vibe, but the fragrance starts getting woody from the cedar and ""fresher"" from the LOTV. The cardamom and nutmeg are quite present here as well, and they do a good job of surrounding all that freshness with a kick of spice. Fantastic stuff. 
As it dries down, believe it or not, I also get some bit of powder, I am guessing from the violet, which somehow manages to work so well with the citruses and the fresh floral. The LOTV comes out so well here as well! CK One then turns into this beautiful, fresh floral, with some spice and powder in the background. I also get a little bit of musk and oak moss, but only if I move around. 
Now I understand why this had (and still has) such a mass following. Definitely unisex, but I think its the right balance: not too masculine, not too feminine. I'd say it's some good juice to start with for anyone just starting to explore unisex fragrances. 
Projection is about arms length, and it lasts quite a bit (about 6-7 hours on me). I'd say this is suitable for hot weather, but it could also work well for rainy spring type weather.
Definitely getting a full bottle once I am done with my current sample. 1990s in a bottle for him and her. Simply put a classic citrus blend of tranquility. Really love this stuff. And I’m honestly considering making this my signature scent. When I use this I don’t feel like I’m wearing cologne it feels more like I just stepped out the shower and use some clean soap and lotion and you can really tell others around love smelling it on you when they deeply inhale when they are close to you. Very fresh and alluring and Sexy when it’s not trying to be Oh sweet 90's how I miss you. This is an episode of My So Called Life in a bottle. Flannel shirts, Jansport backpacks, a hot late afternoon watching Ricki Lake before your parents get home from work. CK One in one word would be 'soft', and I don't mean that in regards to its silage. It's a woody muted floral that isn't sweet, isn't juicy despite all the citrus, and never screeches or beams even if its a textbook clean perfume. Just a pleasant and cheap summer fresher upper with that subtle trademark laundry vibe that stole the show in the 90's. Is it dated? Yeah, a bit. The previous tenant left this in my recent apartment and it was fun to re discover, but I doubt it'll be getting much usage despite being pleasant. Nostalgia is so bittersweet. first off I’ve never smelled a more unisex fragrance in my life. This has that powdery/makeup vibe you want from a female scent but yet has the acquatic/woody pine you want from a male scent! I’d say this Leand maybe 25% more to the men’s side. It smells like the 90s can’t go wrong. It’s a summer scent I like it. My current every day scent - I reapply if I stop by home in my travels. My teen self had no time for Calvin as I headed straight for the Shishedo beauty counter for a spray of the mythical Feminite Du Bois (divine irreplaceable - the reason I joined this site, my preciouss!!!),sometimes detouring to Mitsouko for a heavenly whiff. Although there are many comments on the dated nature of CK 1, I have no nostalgia for it and I get comments wearing it too. Maybe not so popular in good old Adelaide as in other places at the time. It is fresh, light, yet has depth. It works for my tanned oily skin, and I look young for my age. No headache inducing powers here, just good clean fun. young and fresh smell. top notes are too fruity for my likings although the middle and base notes are gorgeous and masculine Very old school scent. 
My mom wears this and I like it. 
The scent is fresh and suitable for her.
As for me, this scent isn't for me. 
It smells awkward on my skin. 
Overall, it's okay :) You know it, I know it, most distinctive citrus in the world.
It's popular because is good. A true classic. 4/5 My first scent memory.
I received a bottle of this in 1998, 6th grade, but rarely used it.
In 2001, a girl I took to a freshman high school dance wore CK One. By the end of the night, I was covered in this. I fell in love. She broke my heart. For the next two weeks, this scent was stuck in my head. All day, everyday I thought about her and had this scent stuck in my head.
When I want to relax and be at peace with the world, I will dab a little from my 1998 bottle on my wrist before I go to sleep.
My first scent memory. Such an amazing recipe, popular and probably overplayed in the past, but now finds itself perfect for the daily runner. Smells relatively generic, but expensive generic. Beautiful sparkling citruses especially the bergamot. Kinda reminds me of D&G Light Blue in how it has a masculine vibe. Fujiyama is a dupe for this but it is slightly off. Please, never discontinue this fragrance.
Period. I really love This fresh, soapy and squeaky clean perfume. For me this is by far the Best unisex scent ever made. For me it has all the elements a unisex should have... not too feminine nor too masculine. One of my all time favorites. Both silage and longevity could be better... but I love to respray so no hamre done. The price i fair for such a quality scent. cK one is the one for me. Soft and pleasant in every way.
Affordable luxury CK ONE is one of those fragrances that smells very different to me depending on the weather. It’s just the thing for a hot, sticky summer day as it’s very refreshing and has the right balance of sharp citrus and softer woody/floral/spicy notes. It isn’t sweet, there’s no vanilla and the citrus is the only fruity note that I can smell. (There’s pineapple in the notes, but it isn’t evident on me.) This is a versatile fragrance and can be dressed up or down, but I tend to wear it primarily as a casual day scent. I find the sillage to be pretty soft and I can apply very liberally without worrying about fumigating the room. Overall longevity is good, but on me it’s so soft that I sometimes like to reapply during the day for a nice citrus burst. 
On the other hand, if it’s a chilly day, CK ONE smells like straight-up lemon juice on me for the first hour or so. Once it dries down, I get the well-blended scent that I like and the rest of the progression is the same as it is in hot weather. Also, I prefer stronger fragrances in cool/cold weather and this fragrance is rather too soft for me when the temperatures are lower. So, now that we’re finally getting autumn weather around here, CK ONE goes to the back of the shelf until next summer.
(Batch code 7183, manufactured in July, 2017.) Ck One, a low-cost but high-quality perfume. Very fresh and limonose opening. The pineapple along with citrus fruit is something unique and reminds me very much of Chrome by Azzaro. Note green and fresh, then something floral. I do not think I did. Sore point: If you have an acidic PH you have to do 5 separate splashes to make it last for at least 4 hours. The scent of youth! No need to introduce this frag: like Acqua di Gio, it's a summer classic. Green/musky/floral with a noticeable oakmoss note in the base. Has been already smelt elsewhere since it was issued, but 20 years ago, it was a real revolution.
Easy casual for hotter days. You get a simple but solid fragrance, and you can't go wrong. I'd choose this one or Azzaro Chrome over Acqua di Gio' any day. (noting that CK One and Chrome retail for ~$20, while AdG retails for $50/60.... just nonsense).
Spring/summer days, 15-35, unisex leaning a bit feminine. If you were to distill the idea of tennis into a fragrance, it would probably smell like this. I don't get overt citrus with this but it's definitely there somewhere - it makes the whole thing smell fresher. 
I was born after the enormous ubiquity so I'm not affected by that in the way some other reviewers are. I'd still only wear this with casual clothes though - perhaps with a T-shirt and trousers when I want to feel a bit more professional. This smells indeed fresh and clean in a nice way. I also find it very calming. Glad I could try it, but don't need a bottle of this when my sample is finished. Guys, if you want a versatile, masculine, acquatic, not overpowered fragrance, this is your choice. This thing is a masterpiece, also because people need to get closer to you to smell, so It turns into a intimate fragrance. I prefere nonoverwhelming fragrances, because they are just perfect, people when come in with a ultra smelly fragrance, it’s just horrible.
Not perfect for date, this is more for a chill plan, but you want to smell incredible. Use this fragrance specially when I don’t know what to wear, or when it’s a super chill plan that I don’t need a strong fragrance.
If you are looking for a more elegant fragrace, try acqua di Gio if you want not a overpowering fragrance. For dates, D&G the one, CH privé, or playboy new york (Montblanc Legend - A&F Fierce Imitation) that will cost you like 14 dollars This scent itself is okay. It didn't even make it to work on me. I can barely even detect it when I sniff my arm where I applied it, and I was heavy-handed and tend to be extremely sensitive. Not a huge disappointment as I bought it in a set with some other scents I love. I love this fragrance, not one of my favourites, but even tho I love the innocence and the freshness of it, when I don’t know what perfume to wear, I wear ck one, because is versatile, I use it only for summer, or for bbq’s with my friend in hot weather, not so recommended for winter or cold weathers, doesn’t mean it smells bad in weather, it’s because the cold weather neutralizes a lot the fragrance, you’ll almost won’t feel it, for cold weathers I recommend Polo Red, D&G the one, Lacoste essential, Ch ch/privé, Zara pour homme II and for me adg with do in any weather, best in summer, but not the best performance in winter I always knew of this perfumes's legendary status as well as it's basic-ness. 
However, I bought a bottle for dirt cheap recently and I was surprised at how much I've come to like it. It's fresh, laid back and refreshing (particularly on hot summer days). Seeing as I was not around in the 90s when this perfume was all the rage (and could be smelt everywhere apparently) I think I can appreciate it. 
Go on, give it a try! Feminine/ Masculine/ Unsisex...etc. If it smells good on you, wear it. The lines in perfumery are blurring. Good starter perfume for anyone who does not normally wear a scent. Very fresh and citrus smelling perfume. Be wary though the chemistry of your skin changes this scent vastly, it smells nice on my slightly acidic oily skin but I have smelled it on others with dry skin and it smells like rubbing alcohol. CK One is a 'play-safe' sort of fragrance perfect for hot weather. It's clean, fresh and pleasing to the senses. However, it can't be classified as a impression-making scent and is best suited for daily use in the summer when your motive is just to smell clean and pleasant rather than grabbing attention. I know Ck One is considered an outdated fragrance however I keep buying it after the years. Being a doctor I like to wear something fresh and not over the top while going to work and I think this is perfect. It’s fresh, clean, youthful. It’s nice during the summer but also all year round, in my opinion, this is the kind of fragrance you can’t go wrong! My first and I hope only negative review and I appreciate that the biggest factor in fragrance preferenes is that it is purely subjective. However, with CK One;
I find the top notes quite offensive as to me they smell so synthetic and over-powering and additionally the sillage of these top notes must be a good half hour or even an hour. A nightmare start to my day during my commute is that some guy has liberally sprayed himself with this and the harsh, green, aquatic top notes absolutely fill the carriage. It's really offensive and that the individual clearly thinks it's a good thing just makes it worse; and not just CK One either - Thierry Mugler's Womanty has the same aquatic harsh overpowering effect. Luckily this has been discontinued - unluckily a woman in the office is wearing it right now :( may it slip from her hand the next time she applies it in her bathroom.
I have a little Amouage Interlude in my bag, I think I will put a little on my top lip. CK One is your no-nonsense kind of fragrance. Very laid back and casual. It's fresh, lemony clean and a little musky on the dry down. It's a safe inoffensive pleasant scent. This really does put a spring in your step and a smile on your face. Perfect when it's hot and sunny. Longevity is above average for me. Citrusy fresh 1st hour and then floral..why a fragrance has to be masculine or feminine...it's pleasing for both..keeps u fresh in hot summers..that's enough.. masterpiece Blind buy in 2008 because of sale. 
Used it on a few casual occassions and sometimes work. Tried to like it but I can't, maybe that jasmine and turpentine kinda smell linger that bothers me.
I gave it to someone I forgot who, the same year I bought. 
Sorry CK One I just can't handle u anymore This is really a great summertime fragrance. Bright, crisp and refreshing. It's a green citrus on me and you can't over use this fragrance as it is light and inoffensive. I love wearing this after a day at the beach or a dip in the pool. It's simply sunshine in a bottle that's always in style. I still have a little of this left in a bottle I purchased in the mid 90’s. Lots of memories associated with that bottle!
This scent still smells fairly good today. The citrus screams summer, and occasionally I’ll wear it to the beach or when going out on the boat. 
When I finish this bottle, I probably won’t replace it, I’ll let this one pass like a fond memory... and leave the bottle tucked away with nice pair of ripped up jeans from yester-year. If I want to travel back in time to the 90s when I was in high school, I just put this on. It's actually my husband's but we share it since it's unisex. I love green fragrances and this is one of the classics. love the freshness but doesnt last long, very disappointed. It's fresh and youthful. If you are an energetic person and full of youthful energy and are looking for a fragrance that doesn't scream 50+ yo retired businessman, this might be your jam.
It's weak and fades (being an EDT). So you will need several spritz and maybe play around with where you spritz to get a longer lasting effect.
If you are young and looking for cheap fresh fragrance for your first one, this is it. It's unisex in that there is no overbearing floral or spice scents.
As always, buy a test or go in-store to see whether you personally like it.
Scent : 8/10
Performance : 6/10
Value : 9/10 This straight up smells like white florals with some musk in the background its way too feminine in my opinion, but if your a classy gentleman you might pull this one off. Its fresh clean but smells like something a chic lady would wear rather than a man. Lasted a few hrs on my skin in the temperate weather becomes skin scent in an hour.
Scent : 6/10
Performance : 6/10
Value : 7/10 This smells almost identical to Azzaro's Chrome, and al-Rehab's Silver. Ok but not great.
3.5/5 One of the first frags I owned. I remember smelling it at age 15 around 2010, the scent was so intensely bright and fresh to my untrained nose. I have recently purchased this for my (female) partner because I find the florals and tea in the dry down far too feminine for a man in his 20s. 
The opening is a bitter, sharp lemon zest which within about 5 minutes mellows down to smooth dry citrus with a hint of tea leaf. Only in the opening does this fragrance resemble anything masculine.
Within half an hour this becomes a floral tea scent with a light musk undertone. To me, CK One leans more feminine due to its softness. Very similar to EA Green Tea.
Still a wonderful fragrance, very fresh and inoffensive. Not distracting and nice to wear, awesome dude! This was fantastic when I was in seventh grade and it’s fantastic now. Radiant citrus and tea freshness with a shot of spicy warmth from nutmeg and cardamom. Even though I actually wore this when it came out, it doesn’t feel dated to me- I think it’s still great for casual use. I don't like the top notes, I absolutely love the dry down. If anyone is reviewing this after the the first 2 minutes I suggest waiting a bit. Perfect for a summers night. It's soft enough but not too femenine for guys and a real people pleaser."
1,Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007," C90 (2020 batch)
After years of purchasing decants, I finally decided to buy a 100ml. It’s100% reformulated to trash. all the sweet notes have been toned down. All I’m getting it’s a dusty tobacco, lots of dry spices and the tobacco blossom note is quite prominent now.
This batch should just be renamed to Tobacco Épices. But some may love it. First spray on paper: Chai tea latte! Sweet, warm and delicious-- but basic. The initial spray was mouth-watering, but it was too reminiscent of a seasonal candle. The vanilla and the spices (cinnamon, clove, etc.) were immediately present. If you don't like gourmand scents, stay far away. The initial spray on paper made me think this scent lacked complexity and elevation. The dry-down on skin proved me wrong. The longer you smell it, the more it changes. 
On my skin: A distinct powderiness comes forward as it dries down-- tobacco blossom, perhaps? The notes of dried fruit (definitely some sort of berries) and cocoa are very prominent when sprayed on my skin, and they combine to create a boozy, almost medicinal, accord reminiscent of rum or even holiday fruit cake. The tobacco is elevated and ephemeral. If I put my nose directly to my skin, I won't get the tobacco note. Instead, the tobacco and vanilla notes are intertwined and exist in the sillage, wafting around you. 
The powder and berry notes make this distinctly feminine to me. The femininity is tempered slightly by the masculine tobacco aura, but it is nonetheless not the truly unisex scent many characterize it as. Avoid for summer-- the sweetness of the berries, cocoa and vanilla will mix poorly with sweat and natural musk-- but excellent for all other seasons. There's nothing juvenile or simple about this scent. Mature without being grannyish. Sexy, but not too try-hard. Bold notes are muted in a way that keeps this fragrance from being too garish or difficult to wear. The right woman could wear this with jeans and tee, but it's probably best reserved for an intimate night-time occasion. 
High-quality bottle, even with respect to the travel size. The travel size has a magnetic cap with a nice atomizer. Post Traumatic Stress Disorded In a Bottle!
I Used to wear the thing back in 2017! During a rough period for me! Well silly me! I absolutely thou i can overcome scent memory!
Here im 4 years later with PTSD just smelling this! Now you know! Never wear a fragrance when you are feelin some type of way!
To the actual thing! This smells like Tobacco! Vanilla! Booze! Dried Fruits!
Something in this composition is sickly sweet and annoying! Smelling this up close!
The Sillage however is another beast! I Must say this fragrance turns heads in the winter time!
This is the 1 Million of the Niche realm, This is the thing the ""economically independent kids"" used to rock a decade ago! Ofcoursed with Apple devices on hand!
I Respect it! I dont love it!
9.5/10 It's quite clear upon first sniff that you are dealing with a special fragrance made from high quality ingredients. First and foremost I smell a deliciously festive and spicy combination of cloves and cinnamon (notes which persist throughout the mid and deep dry down). Next, an earthy, sweet tobacco note begins to peek through. It is warm, sweet, and comforting, made zesty and uplifting by the spices. The vanilla in this is smooth and woody. The longer it sits on the skin, the sweeter it becomes but the sweetness here is not artificial, it is perfectly balanced and downright joyful. Be warned, however - if you are not a fan of spicy (as in spices) fragrances, this might not be the one for you. I feel like Tobacco Vanille would have been more aptly named if ""Clove"" or ""Spice"" were included somewhere in the name. Tobacco Vanille is my - i'm wearing all black tonight - scent. It's so sexy, addictive, and just yummy. To me, it's the perfect balance of sweetness blended seamlessly with a woody tobacco. Vanilla has always been (and probably always will be) my favorite scent - but this isn't your average vanilla fragrance. It's so dark and rich and really just a wow fragrance for me. I hope to always keep a bottle in my collection. This is the gold standard of tobacco vanilla scents. I have to be in the mood to wear it. The spices are up front and intense, and I find I’m worn out before the fragrance is. I can’t speak to the current formulations but I have an older bottle and it lasts for 8-10 hours easily. TF TV is rich and spicy and exudes quality. It scratches an itch for me that nothing like it does. But I could see someone not liking the spices in this. The tobacco and vanilla are lovely but the cinnamon/clove/nutmeg accord is anything but subtle in the early stages. This is not for people who can’t tolerate intense spices. Like I said, I have to be ready to wear this. It’s for nights you want to make an impression. And you will. I’m obsessed. I smelled this in the department store and let it sit on my skin. It dries down and you definitely smell the cinnamon. Hours later, I could still smell it. Haven’t purchased yet but definitely plan to. I tested it along with TF Tobbaco Oud, I feel that the TF TV is too weak is it only me? shall I try testing in another store? I heard some youtubers talking about reformulation for TF perfumes from 2020 onwards? Batch:	AB0 20344 (11-2020)
I really enjoy this scent but was quite surprised by the performance after reading reviews of it being almost to strong.
I was expecting similar sillage, as for instance spicebomb extreme, which is one of my favorite scents.
TV turns into a skin scent for me rather quickly. Spraying on clothes doesn’t really seem to make a difference. It does last long but I wish it would project more.
Definitely not what I was expecting. Does anyone else have a similar experience? Tobacco Vanille. 
I've got a lot to say about this one.
I'll start with three words (if I had to choose only three): Sweet, Sensual, Sophisticated. I have to say though, after developing a close relationship with this delicious beast, I think Mr. Ford got the name reversed; it should've been named 'Vanille et Tabac'; the vanilla note is commander-in-chief here. The tobacco is in there, but it's closer to the sweetness and mildness of a Danish tobacco than to the pungent and perfume-like aroma of Oriental tobacco, and it never gets a chance to truly shine, sadly. The vanilla always has the upper hand all the way through drydown. And it may just be my nose, but in the middle of it all I get the impression of a slight Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookie note. Does that make it bad? Certainly not, unless you can't stand really sweet scents, in which case I would tell you to stay far away from this one. If a more incense-like, Oriental tobacco presence is more your thing, I would direct you to Mancera Red Tobacco as my favorite alternative, but I digress... 
I am a tobacco note fanatic, it is my favorite aroma in perfumes. So far I've acquired about fifteen fragrances with tobacco either in their names, and/or as a major note, and out of all them, Tobacco Vanille takes the prize with regards to:
- Overall quality of ingredients (debatable, certainly, but I'm saying they are well above average when I compare it to the similar ones in my collection) 
- Steadfast longevity (this juice will last at least 12 hours on the skin, and around a week on a shirt if you don't wash it), 
- Aroma strength / scent bubble (you'll get at least a six-foot radius)
- Having the most consistent, linear lifespan (its character remains virtually the same from fresh out of the bottle to barely a whisper behind the ear) 
- Being the absolute Sweetest Beast Mode fragrance of the bunch!
Incidentally, if I were to compare Tobacco Vanille's outstanding qualities to those of an automobile, it would be a Porsche 911 Turbo S. 
All of the above qualities combined make it worth every penny of the high price it fetches, when you consider that a bottle will probably last you several years if you use it mostly for special occasions and you only spray it once per application, and trust me, you don't need to spray it any more than that, especially indoors; this juice has enough strungth to fill a large room with its aroma from just two sprays, so I offer a friendly recommendation/warning to go easy on this stuff. It's an amazing delight for the senses when used very sparingly, but it can quickly become a sickeningly sweet, cloying, obnoxious, migraine-inducing nightmare if it's overdone. If you must spray it twice, please, do it outside, and walk into it from a couple of feet back, that will do you just fine for the entire day. 
It is a straight up unisex scent, and I think it would be an awesome fragrance for the 25+ year old ladies and gentlemen to wear to a fancy dress do or wedding or outdoor party, but I would not wear this in the club; it's too nice of a fragrance, too luxurious, too expensive, and to me it demands a degree of discretion, but that's only my impression; you may get great results on the dancefloor, but for that setting, and for the price, I believe JPG Ultra Male, YSL 'Y' EdP, or Armani Code Profumo would be better sweetness contenders, but again, I digress... 
I find it odd to find myself saying this, given that I feel like it's too good for the club, but in a casual situation, like running errands around town, this would be a fun one to put on just to get strangers to turn their heads...but careful, you just might end up with a line of them following behind you ;) If worn right, this fragrance has an awesome Wow factor, and it can be a great compliment-getter! And if you do decide to go casual with it...I'm no fashion guru, but don't wear this with just jeans and a t-shirt; this deserves at least the addition of a sport coat and some comfortable leather dress shoes to complete the outfit.
I wouldn't wear this to work. It seems too sweet and distracting and intense for a work environment, at least an indoor one. 
Also, I would not put this on if I were going somewhere to eat. People may disagree with me, but this is a gourmand more than just an aromatic, due to the heavy vanilla, and gourmands distract me from my meal. I can't eat a savory main course and have a persistent aroma of a sugary dessert right under my nose the whole time, no thank you! 
Finally, if you're looking for a great introduction to Tom Ford's fragrance lines, I'd say, with the exceptions of Oud Wood and Ombre Leather (personal preferences), you don't need to look any further. 
My verdict: Overall 9 out of 10. Very, very nice if used with restraint. This fragrance really rides that fine line between sublime and repulsive; all it takes is one spray too many to tip that scale toward the latter. An excellent value despite the high cost; I think you really do get what you pay for here. It loses a point for being just a bit too sweet an aroma overall, and not having the tobacco note more prominent in the mix, but otherwise it's Excellent. 
I highly recommend that everyone at least gives Tobacco Vanille a sniff once in their life, if the chance comes along, and if you're interested in buying some, then I think it is imperative that you do sample it first. If you're a big fan of the main notes already, then this could be a very tempting blind buy. I think it is a wonderful treat for the senses, and if you have that wish list of fragrances you have to save up for, then this could be a very worthy addition to it. Best tobacco ever! So sexy so elegant I'm honestly really dissapointed. I was going to blind buy this but I'm very glad I got a 3ml decant first. It smells like Christmas if that makes sense? It's a huge cinnamon bomb for the first few hours and is really over powering. My girl friend didn't like it, she said it smells like an Xmas Yankee candle and I sadly agree.
It's STRONG and spillage is big but it took atleast 2 hours before it started to settle into a different smell, it loses some of the cinnamon and turns into the tobacco scent, I get zero vanilla and zero sweetness from this. Please please don't blind buy this it will save you a lot of money. When I first tried this, I sprayed it once on a shirt in the closet in a room and smelled it from up close, and I was like... who would want to wear this? Then I left the closet door half open, and left the room and that was at a young night. The next day, I went back in the room to grab something, and had forgotten about that spray, and I smelled something amazing sort of woody in the air! And I was like where is that smell coming from?? It felt like I have smelled this long time ago but couldn't put my finger on what it was. Since then this fragrance became an instant love for me! Great and refined better than niche quality imho! 10/10 with awesome performance. Great job Tom Ford. I succumbed to the hype. I bought a sizeable decant of this one. I'm not blind buying a 300 bone fragrance, as much as I think this would be fine in that instance. If you have the extra cash, you like tobacco and cinnamon based scents, well you may have a winner here. Can't comment on presentation or what have you... I'm sure it's good. It's Tom Ford.
So, the scent. Absolutely tobacco and spices... Mostly cinnamon but it's a melange of spices. A little sweetness from the vanilla and cacao. I think this is a case where it smells designer and the price tag doesn't justify what you get. Being brutally honest. It is a great scent. It lasts, too.... Is it worth the price tag though? I would say no. Starts with a nice blast of tobacco and spices, dries down to faint tobac and cinnamon. That's what you're getting. Maybe a little spiciness from cardamom (which isn't listed) but that's it. It's extremely basic. I feel like you could get something similar at a fraction of the cost.
Situationally? Formal. It does smell high end and masculine. If you want a black tie scent, here you go. Otherwise, you could skip it and find something similar for much less.. As far as scent alone, it is a magnificent marriage between tobacco and spices. I am weary of the cost/benefit ratio, though. In my personal opinion this is one of the best private blends Tom Ford does. 
I love when a perfume ""takes you somewhere"", and Tobacco Vanille takes me to a gentleman's sitting room, with dark rosewood furniture, cigars and scotch being poured from decanters.
The masculine vibes of tobacco and cognac and wood are balanced well with the vanilla. Sometimes vanilla can be very overpowering and make a perfume too sweet and feminine, however the way it is done here makes the perfume truly unisex. This would smell equally expensive and sexy on both men and women. #تجربتي

تقييم العطر من وجهة نظري
رائحه ٤.٥ من ٥
ثبات ٤.٥ من ٥
فوحان ٤ من ٥ Tip of the day ! Byredo eleventh hour smells quite similar but can be worn in warmer weather too ! Try and see ! Cheers I had a strong reaction to Lost Cherry and Bitter Peach... my tongue swelled... but with Tobacco Vanille... something else swelled. Let's just say the more I smelled, the more I wanted to hump the bottle. The more I sprayed myself, the more I wanted to hump myself. I f--king LOVE LOOOOVVVVEEEE this stuff!
I have tried a couple batches and I like the smokier for sure. The spices can get Chrismassy in a Santa non-f--kable way, which is sad. So keep it smoky, please Tom!
I am late to the party as usual on all things, and I actually first explored this just after Valentine's Day (2021) on vacation on Jekyll Island in GA. Our awesome fragrance guy at Nordstrom (near Philly) gave me great samples of TF and PdM, and I just was crazy for TF TV! A month on the island was magic and so was the fragrance... and I also like that this smoke kept bugs away. Bliss!!!!
Came home and bought my first bottle! Currently my signature and fave fave fave!!!! Beautiful scent with two dominant and obvious scents - tobacco and vanilla however the scents blended are lovely. Given the balance it’s a good unisex scent. Smells like fall or winter. I can’t tell you how much a I adore this perfume. 
It starts off with a dark, sexy and intoxicating blast of Vanilla and Tobacco. Think Cigars and a dark, twisted version of Vanilla which is the result of Tobacco, Vanilla and fruity notes giving it a slightly boozy, Whiskey like facade. 
The spices give it a moody edge, almost like the yellow light from the lamps inside a gentlemen’s club and their contrast from the mahogany covered walls and dark leather chairs. 
The dry down is a very beautiful vanilla-woody-spicy slightly fruity affair which makes it even more addictive. Have I anything to say that hasn't been said ?
This fragrance is exquisitely simple, and beautifully well balanced. The name depicts exactly what you will get greeted with: A pouring of thick vanilla cream over a freshly opened box of cigarets. It's a perfect balance of tobacco, vanilla, and some spices accompanying the fragrance from beginning to end very interestingly.
Tobacco lovers, or not. Vanilla fans, or not. I don't really know anyone who does not 'Like' Tobacco Vanille, or at least appreciate it. If it's not at first sniff, maybe the second....or third. This fragrance, imo, screams emotions and feelings. It is warm, deep, mature but playful at the same time. 
TF TV is one of a kind, and which possibly launched the sweet-tobacco trend since it's release in 2007. Very suitable in winter and fall, but equally beautiful for spring and humid summer nights - possibly wearing a blue linen shirt, on a rooftop bar, having some cocktails. 
For me, this is a 10/10 fragrance for the simplicity, depth, warmth, and emotions it triggers.. Im dissapointed! In the store I smelled it and bought it a week later but now after wearing it for a couple hours I don't like the smell. Gives me a headache, soooo much vanilla. Will be giving it to my sister. Smells too dirty for me. However it is VERY VERY VERY strong.. I did 2 sprays on my neck and my room smelled like it when I got home! Long lasting. Just not my taste. Molasses cookies, gingersnappy spices, syrupy vanilla. Delicious. My son says it reminds him of chai.
An hour later I'm starting to get a headache. Bummer. Dries down into a spicy leather.
This is delicious but not a scent I can wear for long. Solidly unisex fragrance. Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford is a really great one with good projection & longevity as well ( tobacco , vanilla , woody notes ) are balanced in this freg.
Thumps Up & keep up the good work. This perfume just screams “ I GOT MONEYYYYYYYY, AND I’M LETTING YOU KNOW”.
Heads will be turned wearing this perfume. A man wearing this perfume going out with his guy friends, will get the most attention. Everyone will look at him when the ober askes who to give the bill to.
A Woman wearing this perfume just screams “ I’m independent, and can take good care of myself “.
Wearing this scent to a normal 9-5 job will have your coworkers think you don’t need this job, and that you got stacks of money. LOL
The notes I pickup are: Spices, Vanilla, Cacao , Tobacco, and a little hint of Fruit wich makes the perfect blend.
I would personally wear this fragrance in the winter time or when I know that I will be in an airconditioned room. It last 8+ hours on my skin. 
Although this is the perfect fragrance, it is NOT for the weak !!!
5/5 Star I don't know what I can say about TV that hasn't already been said. To me, and many others, this is the gold standard for any gourmand, vanilla, tobacco. This is what any fragrance with those main notes or accords will get compared to, and depending on where it lands, will be sweeter or less sweet, smoky or less smoky than TV. And that's just how it is, this is a staple fragrance, and for good reason. No one does it like TF and if you haven't smelled it, do yourself a favour and try a decant or sample. You will not be disappointed. 
I also think this is a gold star for being one of the most perfectly unisex fragrances out there. While again, fragrance has no gender, this really is right in the middle. I think anyone could wear this and I would be hard pressed to find anyone who doesn't at least find this perfume to smell nice.
Longevity is excellent, 8-10 hours on my skin, silage is heavy. 
Overall 9.5/10, TF knows what he's doing and this is a top seller for a reason. I get greenish tobacco and a twist of spice. Then the darkest vanilla extract and then I am transported to a French bakery and I am mixing madeleines whilst eating sinful amounts of warm fruit cake.
I broke a bottle of this once and it was like vanilla extract. I like vanilla and all things sweet and vanilla. For me, it’s love in a bottle. The bottle that broke was the old formula though. I had to replace it with a 100ml of something not quite as lovely ahhh. The end x Perfect fragrance .... A must have by every fragrance connossieur or fragrance head .. a lovely opening of spiced vanilla and tobacco ... On the dry down i smell the dried fruits tobacco and vanilla 
This is my best fragrance ever. .... Got a sample of Tom Ford’s “Tobacco Vanille” today. Wow. This smell seriously makes me feel like I’m cruising around Havana, Cuba, in the evening with Fidel Castro as my chauffeur. But like...he just got a vanilla air refresher in a vain attempt to cover up the mustiness that is his 1950’s coupe deville. And there’s a wet dog in the backseat with me. He’s takes a puff of his a cigar and while turning around to apologize for the smoke, he spills a hot chocolate he’s been sipping all over my pants. 
That’s what this smells like; like Fidel Castro’s beard. Don't expect this to be a more sweet and easy vanilla, it is definetly tobacco and vanille. The spicy feeling leaves the sweet part leaning more sour, like a strong vanilla liquor drunk alongside a cigar, or maybe catching a whif of a smoker wearing a vanilla perfume. It's not that it is not pleasant, it is, but if you spect somehow for the vanilla to be like a madeleine-type instead of approaching honey territory, skip this. Definetly unisex, I don't think it leans towards any side and with the right attitude, anyone could pull this off. The performance is a roller coaster, it starts so intense it feels headache-inducing but then it drops suddenly and becomes a subtle but pleasant skin scent, even if not as intense, it still holds on fairly well on my skin. Perhaps the intensity drop is for the best, as i feel that overspraying this or a way too strong projection could easily make this perfume annoying, cloying or even offensive for some. Love the scent. 
However, on me it turns into a faint skin scent after 2-3 hours. Very disappointed...I cannot justify spending $300 on a weak 50ml EDP. (Has this been reformulated or is it just an issue with my skin chemistry?)
Not fbw. At the moment, this is my go to cologne for special occasions and date nights. The problem is it can be overpowering so you have to be careful with the sprays. The smell is similar to a smokey Vanilla candle with a touch of tobacco. I will also say this is definitely a Unisex Parfum. Expensive but a great buy for sure!! If i started writing I won’t finish today 
I will briefly say that this is the only TF private blend fragrance that If got discontinued I will run to the closest boutique to get a back up bottle Very unisex. Smells like a vanilla, cinnamon cigar. Makes me feel like I’m the most sexy and mysterious passerby sitting at a dimly lit bar table lol. This is a very rich fragrance. Spicy tobacco with a layer of vanilla bean and undercut by currents of Tonka bean and cacao. This scent is just delicious. I wish I could eat it. This is a very mature scent, I'd say for over 28+. 
This is one of those unique unisex perfumes that smells just as good on either sex. I'd wear this for intimate dates because when someone hugs you they don't want to pull away. 
There are many clones and interpretations of this that cost much less but they are not Tom Ford's Tobacco Vanille. The quality of this perfume is above reproach. It smells better than you'd expect it to.
The projection is enormous and the sillage is like a cruise ship's wake. This lasted over 30 hours on my skin and twice as long on my clothes.
I recommend everyone into tobacco Scents get a bottle of this. The cost is high but it is worth every single cent for this scent. I smelled this.. Loved it. Went shocked by the price.. Searched for a clone . bought Al Haramain Tobacco for a fraction of the price and much better sillage. Never looked back. So go for the better Clone. 
End of story I'm definitely gonna buy this for next fall/winter it's smells like a honey tobacco ,very classy ,grown and sexy fragrance I was so disappointed by this.
Let me preface my review with the fact that I LOVE THIS PERFUME. When I smelled it for this first time, I knew that it would be my signature scent. It's gorgeous: a warm, spicy vanilla with a hint of amber. It's sweet without being cloying, spicy without being musky. I could smell it all day. I bought a full-sized bottle for myself, the most expensive purchase I have ever made.
However... sillage on me is literally 0. When I did my research, I found a bunch of users who said that you could absolutely not spray this perfume more than twice without overwhelming a whole city block. This is totally not true in my case. I did 7 (SEVEN!!) sprays, went out with some friends, and not one of them could smell it on me unless they pressed their nose into my skin. Further, the lasting power is only ok (I can still smell it at the end of the day, but only if I also press my nose into my wrist).
I bought my bottle from a department store. It's real. I've stored it in the box, in a cool, dry location. I'm spraying on my pulse points with moisturized skin. There's absolutely no reason why this perfume would be performing badly, outside any issues with skin chemistry.
Anyways, just a word to the wise. Try it before you buy it to see if it projects on you.
I'm wondering if I'm totally crazy, or if anyone else has had this experience with this so-called 'powerhouse' perfume! This cologne is absolutely amazing. This is hands down the cologne of 2020/2021. I often like to wear two colognes: one for the skin, and one for my outerwear. This cologne is perfect for the skin as it leaves a strong musky yet very sweet smell on the skin, and I love to pair it with Margiela's Jazz club on my clothes (the ladies love it hahah). Christmas in a bottle. The beautiful cherry tobacco is so wonderfully intense and it’s paired with syrupy dried fruits that resemble a mince pie. There is a dry , powdery cocoa note that encapsulates the main notes in a delicious cloud. In the dry down the vanilla rises and pairs equally with the tobacco for a magical result. These are two of my favourite notes so paired together, it’s an inevitable love. This reminds me of Christmas in New York. It’s perfectly unisex. This perfume gave me the wrong impression at first. I purchased it with my partner because it's unisex and it could work for both of us. at first spritz, it does not feel regular or familiar, so it can be a bit annoying if you're more into soft romantic scents like I am. However, after a couple of hours of wearing this, I noticed it lingered beautifully on me. It's sweet, yet not too girly. It becomes intimate and sexy, but still not in a slutty way. Even my manager who's usually so strict and never comments on anything walked into the office and the first thing he did was asking where this beautiful scent was coming from. I gotta say... I really like this one! People describe this as 'spicy', but hey this isn't 'spicy'... IT HAS SPICES, YES!
Sweet, cozy, warm & opulent. 
'Spicy' is the term used for a food that brings tears, burns living tissues in the mouth & literally springs a river through the nose... and ofcourse the steam jetting out of one's ears! ;) 
TV doesn't do any such thing, it caresses the most vivid olfactory spots of an individual with some dark satin gloves. Rich, sophisticated and transcendental.
Again, TV has sweet comforting Spices,
and no it isn't 'SPICY'!
Must Try Before U Die sort of a thing... For me, tobacco + spicy notes equaled cinnamon. Fruity+ sweet vanilla= apple. Put it together and for me this smells like a cinnamon apple yankee candle in the best way possible. I would've loved to try it on during Christmas time. Very potent and long lasting. I love the scent however I think its very limited in functionality since you have to be in the right atmosphere. I recently bought a decant as I loved the sound of the notes and wanted to be absolutely certain before splashing out on a FB of this very expensive perfume. The smell blew me away. This is a simply gorgeous vanilla with a divine smoky dry down, not too sweet, totally unisex and utterly delicious. My criticism is that the lasting power is a joke. Its utterly pathetic for the price of this juice. I get 30 minutes and then it disappears into a skin scent. Much as this is beautiful, I couldn't justify a full bottle. Really wanted to like this fragrance. Was looking for a tobacco based cologne for the cold weather months. 
Tom Ford TV was at the top of my list and was looking forward to purchasing this but at the asking price decided to better buy a sample first. Which ended up being a wise choice because I did not like what I smelled. All I got out of this was incense and vanilla.
My search continues. This is STRONG and because it’s so rich it can at times make me feel nauseated. I love the fragrance itself and would be 100% on board with an EDT version with a more moderate projection. Dried fruit, tobacco, and vanilla. I also get a strong almond note that is not mentioned in the scent pyramid. My husband’s been largely tolerant of my fragrance obsession but this was the first scent that truly sparked for him, teleportation in a bottle to a time when his gruff but loving father smoked vanilla tobacco from a pipe that rested on a wood stand. 
It’s a good neck nuzzler. Cozy but classy. Been keeping him stocked with rollerball decants but at some point will need to spring for the undeniably pricey full bottle. Just a warning for anybody who is purchasing this on Ebay. DO NOT BUY FROM RUSSIA!!! I wish I could include a picture so I could show you what a shitty job they did boxing this fake. It was my own fault, I had that twinge of ""this is too good to be true"" at the price but I bought it anyway. Sellers name is aroma_chic. An unapologetically linear spicy vanilla gourmand with hints of rich dark chocolate and dried fruit in the background. The tobacco is very inoffensive, it is light, it is sweet, it is somewhat feminine. I have no issue with this as I believe all fragrances are truly unisex, but for a western nose it may be slightly feminine. 
I also pick up something somewhat nutty in the background, very subtle but there.. reminds me of a creamy macadamia nut (again this is very subtle!) The key players here are sweet vanilla, gentle sweet tobacco, tied together with some Christmas spices, dried fruits and dark chocolate. I have a “vintage” bottle (2010) and a 2019 decant. The reformulated version is a sparse thin veil of its former self. Unless you have money to burn, buy Al Haramain’s Amber Oud Tobacco Edition (which has no Oud despite the name). It’s five times the strength at one seventh the cost! I’ve found Al Haramain fragrances to be powerful, economical, and their customer service is superb.
Tom Ford has gone the way of many designers: All name, no game. When launched was a shock in 2007. Now many fragrances, even designer's ones, followed this path of oriental gourmand. I still remember my first spray and I was mesmerised. A dry bitter vanilla that confused my senses. It was like nothing smelled before. It does not remind me of something, but it takes away my conscience to a new mysterious world. I would lose my mind to sniff that on a man, but unfortunately never happened. A masterpiece that cannot be missed in collectors' cabinets. 3.5/5 Jesus, I was really expecting more. This fragrance smells of vanilla, dried fruits, cacao, spicy notes, tobacco blossom, and a weird lotion play-doh note. I was expecting a strong more masculine tobacco, but all I get is a very light feminine tobacco blossom note. 
This fragrance is extremely unisex and far more feminine leaning. I personally would not recommend this for a man, and even I am a big fan of unisex and even feminine fragrances for me, this just does not work.
This smells weirdly similar to Lancôme Hypnose, but in all honesty I really prefer hypnose to this. With new perfumes I often spray them on my wrist and close my eyes before the first molecules hit the nose.
The accidental notes sometimes are really funny when you open your eyes surprised that the perfume smells like something you know would never end up being used in perfumery.
Unfortunately with this scent that note to me was corned beef and I can't shake it off.
It's not something you know, but something you feel so how can one cheat oneself that it's not true and it's silly?
It's a shame as I really wanted to like this one!
I guess I'm going to blame my mum for buying very posh corned beef when I was little.
?/10 One of the all time greats! Great projection long lasting.
If your someone who dislikes Tobacco, do not be discouraged by this one, the Tobacco is very Light and blends in well with the Vanilla. Good for special occasions (Dates) and its a Winter evening scent. Its definitely one of the ture Unisex frag out there!!! 9.5/10 This smells like a fall candle to me. Albeit, a very nice candle. But still a candle. If fall was a smell it would be TV 
The tobacco is very light... In the opening I smell a lot of cacao mixed with some spices. After half an hour it develops to a spicy vanilla. I love to spray it on my wrist and smell it during the day. The smell is very intoxicating.
I have to admit that first time I smelled it I was kind of disappointed. I thought it would be heavier on the tobacco. But my disappointment quickly disappeared after smelling that delicious dry down!!
Sillage : 10+
Longevity : 12+ Hours 
Rating : 8/10 As someone used to cheaper scents, this has a lot of complexity and is definitely unique. Alxo, I don't want to smell like stone-fruit boozy vanilla Play-Doh. It smells expensive and is an experience I'm happy to have had. I just put this on I bought the travel spray and I have wafts of soft beautiful vanilla spice all around me, when I put my nose to my skin I smell the clove, but sitting here on my couch in heaven with how this is floating around me just beautiful My bottle is probably 5 or 6 years old. 
I haven't worn it in around a year but after wearing today the juice seems to have gone cinnamon heavy. 
I store it properly, so it shouldn't have gone bad.
Anyone else experience this?
The juice is still wearable just much much more cinnamon than usual. This is cloves, cloves and more cloves. Then a hint of chocolate cloves, then some vanilla with cloves and dry down I’d sweet tobacco and cloves. So, there you have it. There should be a label on it that says “Must love cloves” The heaviness of the clove scent makes it cloying to me. A man could pull this off, but I don’t want to smell this on a female. This one is a little hard to place! At first sniff, it's cold and strong, like vanilla ice cream. But, then settles into a spicy and warm vanilla. Tobacco vanille almost has a lotion-y aspect to it, that reminds me of Lush's vanilla scents, and Snowcake (their wintry marzipan soap). This fragrance smells like real vanilla, bean pod and all. On me the tobacco is light, the leather is present, and I think the wood and fruit come forward more. It's nice but is not my favorite TF fragrance. It doesn't really wow me in the same way they normally do. 'Best Ever' is in the nose of the beholder, so here's an objective description (rather than review). 
Boom! Sweet liquorice/clove on the open, softens quickly through natural leather into addictive pipe tobacco. The Vanilla is clever, it never 'swells', it's always there providing an underlying sweetness, linking everything together. Very clever indeed.
This probably won't be for everyone, and will probably leave untrained noses unimpressed, but make no mistake, this is an elite execution. Sigh, why does this smell like a catholic church to me? I wanted to like it, but I feel like it smells of cinnamon, incense and collection plates. Nice smell for a mass or candles if that's your thing. It's not mine. And this fragrance isn't for me, I guess. Super disappointed. [FEB.2021]
One of the best sweet fragrances of all time and quite possibly the best crowd-pleasing ""starter"" luxury perfume (as Tobacco Vanille Body Spray) of the early 2020s(!)
It is as addictive to my nose now as it was then. This was my perfume, since 2017, that started it all for me and got me hooked into the world of perfumery.
Buying the perfume for $115 (Australian Dollars) as a body spray this gives you a performance beyond what half the other fragrances around the $200+ range can achieve in projection and sniffability when it comes to being able to smell your own scent. In fact, you don't have to worry about not smelling this on yourself if you buy the body spray, whatsoever. 
If you can smell it with a <1 second spritz, you can bet others will wonder what that delicious salted caramellised dried fruit-chewing tobacco smoke-vanilla rum smell is and that is unmistakeably the realm of Tobacco Vanille. 
If you have this now and want more: get ready for the ""gourmands"" of the Niche Fragrance big league and reach for Guerlain's Spiriteuse Double Vanille / Gourmande Coequin(?) , Crivelli's Iris Malikhan, Amouage's Crimson Rocks, April Aromatics' Calling All Angels, Nasomatto's Pardon, Lubin's Gajah Mada, Santa Maria Novella's Vaniglia, and Carner's Palo Santo. 
My personal sweet-savoury vanillas are Tobacco Vanille, Double Vanille and Kurkdijan's Grand Soir. I love cigars and I love vanilla. If you love either of those two things, that alone makes this your perfect cologne. It begins smelling like opening a humidor full of Cuban cigars, mixed with a bit of cinnamon. This fades in an hour and you are left with a spicy vanilla scent for the next 12+ hours (yes, that long)! This might be one of the longest lasting things I’ve ever tried, I have woken up the next day and still smelt like vanilla. Fortunately, I love vanilla. Absolutely majestic and luxurious! What a unique scent, I can certainly understand where the hype comes from. And if I were more into heavy spice laden, rich tobacco smells I could easily see how this is probably the best one out there. Unfortunately it's just too much of everything it contains. It's tobacco, spices, real vanilla (think vanilla paste) to the extreme, so thick and dense that it's almost suffocating. On my skin, this veers too far into masculine territory for my comfort. Now I can handle the male sporty citruses, the barber-shop lavenders, but pipe tobacco will always remind me of my father, a man's man who wore Old Spice and was constantly covered in sawdust from the cabinetry he worked around all day. I just can't seem to pull it off, but I know many women who do. This might be for them, but it's just not for me. And it's such a beautiful scent, it almost pains me to let it go because there's a part of me that wants to keep it around, hoping that maybe with time and age, I'll be able to get over those hang ups and wear this scent the way I know it can be worn by a beautiful, powerful, and even seductive woman. But I just can't, and keeping it and holding onto it but never wearing it would be doing this wonderful artistry of perfume a disservice. I'm saying farwell to you Tobacco Vanille, but I hope to meet you again someday, maybe in passing on a stranger, and I'll smile knowing you were always meant to be worn by someone else. Unfortunately, this perfume is now nothing but a spicy water. I used to LOVE TV, rich, creamy, spicy, heavy vanilla, sweet heavy fruits and tobacco, cacao note was soooo good I could eat my arm..but now, this is just - nothing. I don't know when or why they did this unjustice to this beast of a perfume but I don't want to own it, so I'm getting rid of mine. I will wait for an old(er) batch or maybe for TF house to change something and make it amazing again. If you'll buy it now, have in mind it's nothing more than cinnamon and a hint of watery vanilla. What a shame, so long TV. I get absolutely no tobacco or vanilla. Smells like a fall candle I kid you not. It smells like wax with a cinnamon/ potpourri smell. Very misleading title for this fragrance. Batch is from the end of 2019. No silage skin scent only. Overpriced room spray not worth the hype. This is the scent that got me into fragrance. This is enchanting, warm, sexy, and inviting - it's out of this world. Unisex with a great duality of spicy tobacco and milky vanilla. Very lovely vanilla scent. ... sampled it at the store and am sure i am going to get it ... and make an honest review One of the best things I have ever smelled. If you love vanilla and tobacco in your fragrances this will probably be in your top 3, but since it's sooo expensive I recommend getting a decant/sample before you buy a whole thing. Also if you want a cheaper more feminine version MAC Velvet Teddy smells like 90% similar, the vanilla is less rich, it has a bit of honey, and doesn't last quite as long but it is a fraction of the cost.
Interestingly pulls a little more smoky on me, and a little more sweet on my bf. Nonetheless I'd still say it's unisex and I think it smells amazing on both of us. I sprayed it on at 6:30 and it’s 15:00 now and I can still smell it First blast of vanilla root beer, warm cozy sweet, becoming more dark and smokey as it dries down. It's a rich round sweet pipe tobacco rather than a tangy cigarette tobacco. The potency fades pretty fast on my skin but at least projection radiates a bit and doesn't sit super close. I would expect the strength to maintain some of its levels at $300/50 mL but that wasn't the case.
Unisex but leans a tad masculine and perfect for cold weather nights.
6+ hours later: still there, going moderately strong. When I bought a dab-on sample from lucky sent it smelled straight up like a chocolate milkshake so wasn’t too keen on it for a year or so. Then after that I transferred the perfume to a spray bottle and when I sprayed, it bloomed gorgeously and stayed that way for ages too! The prominent cinnamon clove spice blend at the top followed by the tobacco, woods and tonka in the middle and a lactonic, milky vanilla with chocolate at the base was well blended and not tacky at all. I guess you need to spray to really enjoy. Although similar and cheaper perfumes do exist out there, the sillage, longevity, balance of notes, and consistency of scent is why it’s so expensive in the first place. Great for fall, winter, nighttime or cool weather...not so much for humid climate regions or summer. This is totally unisex as well!! The tobacco clove combo gives it a prominent masculine edge while the cinnamon and the undertone of vanilla gives it a sweet edge that allows women to wear it and still feel distinctly feminine. If wearing to the office I suggest spraying like a day before on your clothes as this scent is a beast. Oh my! This is where you cross over that price point and it REALLY pays off.
A luxurious spicy gourmand, with the perfect balance of vanilla, spice and tobacco. The tobacco notes are quite bright and fresh, so you don't have to worry about that 'stale' ashy smell that can sometimes accompany poorer quality tobacco scents. 
To me, this smells really quite sexual, but understated. Pure class in a bottle. My OH says this smells like dark spicy chocolate to him, but for me it's the vanilla, tobacco, spice and tonka bean that shines through. 
It is simultaneously feminine and masculine. Gender bending, if you will, which is part of what makes this fragrance so sexy. The next time I use this, I will do so wearing chinos, brogues and a tight-fitting rollneck. This is like spraying on confidence! The best sample I have ever purchased. I will be grabbing a full bottle next payday, even if it means I have to eat baked beans for the next month.
UPDATE: More than 24 hours later, I can still smell this on my jacket. Absolute winner! first impressions: a gorgeous creamy, sweet vanilla with an earthy tobacco, masculine leaning but definitely can be worn by both genders. I don't think I will be able to wear it regularly enough to part ways with $200 for it but I'll try the Alexandria dupe or the generic scents dupe
Edit: Generic Scents dupe was a total failure, stinky tobacco not the smooth creamy tobacco found here. I'll try oil perfume's dupe next. Very comforting for a warm winter scent. The tobacco note leans it to the ""more masculine"" side of unisex for me. 
As @JJohans1 mentioned, there was a strange medicinal honey cough drop thing going on at first that I didn't like, but I figured that I should let it dry down and give it a chance before I scrub it off. I'm glad I waited, because the vanilla smells like legitimate vanilla bean paste mixed with an old timey pipe tobacco. Very cozy sweater scent and it's a strong ""like"" from me, but I don't ""love"" it enough to pay what they're currently asking. 
So far out of all the Tom Ford scents that I've tried, Tuscan Leather is the only one that I'm willing to part with $200+ in order to obtain a mere 50 mL. Yes this is phenomenal, everything! I wanted to love it so much but it goes in the gourmand territory smelling like hot milk with hints of cardamom, cinnamon, cacao and vanilla throughout. Performance is terrific This was the fragrance that started me down the rabbit hole of collecting.
I read a review that said if aliens came to earth and needed one fragrance for reference, this would be it.
I used this as my signature cold weather fragrance for several years and it brings back a rush of good memories. 
I wore this on nights out with friends and spur of the moment trips to Vegas with the boys. 
I wore this to work when I was delivering big presentations for a confidence boost. 
I wore this on the first date with my wife. 
I recommend this to all my friends and colleagues when I'm asked for a recommendation. 
It's expensive but 100% worth it IMO. 
Everyone should try and get their noses on this at some point in their lives. It is truly special. The gentle giant. 
The one that started the trend of all trends. 
The jewel of the legendary 2007 collection. 
The one that consistently breaks into all top 10 rankings on blogs, websites and forums. 
You might think that due to how rich it is, it lacks versatility...but no. That's why i called it ""gentle"", because no matter how potent and rich it may present itself on the skin, there's a certain non-intrusive unique tenderness in the vanilla drydown unlike any vanilla i smelled, which makes it wearable any time, any year, any month.
Masterpiece. Started off kinda weird, I felt as if there was this honey note and it wasn't pleasant, but after it settled down it was this lovely vanilla note. Probably the best vanilla I've ever smelt in any fragrance. To my nose this started out very very strong of cloves. As it wore down, I started getting that sweet, fruity tobacco pipe vibe. This is not for the faint of heart. It can definitely be a unisex fragrance. It would better suit a man for a day to day fragrance, in my opinion. I can see myself wearing this wearing a big grandpa sweater and leggings. This was my entry into a totally different fragrance world, away from the drug mart EDT's. Once my wife bought me this, I sold pretty much every EDT I owned and never looked back.
This is her favourite smell, I like it a lot too. If you want a longer lasting, stronger but cheaper replica, Al Haramain's Amber Oud (just make sure it's the right one, apparently there are two of the same name with a different smell).
I still prefer TF Tobacco Oud from the Private Blend but Tobacco Vanille is definitely the silver medal winner for me in that collection.
As much as my wife loves it though, she would never wear it. Smells brilliant but very subtle. The vanilla and tobacco are fresh and smells like the real deal. Could be worn in any occasion honestly. Masala chai (latte)... Classy little bottle. Slightly decadent, too. It would suit a vintage British library in a hall more than my modern style. But I enjoy it as an alternative to florals and fresh fragrances. great cologne everybody tends to enjoy the scent pricey yes but perfect for cold days and evenings Clove gumdrops. Super powdery sweet on my skin - too much so for my taste - and that is what is projecting. There is a bit of leather and vanilla underneath but it's hard for me to detect after having it on for about two hours. Something about my skin tends to accentuate powdery and sweet notes. I may like the smell in the morning, but probably not worth suffering the first few hours to get to it. I may ask my OH to give it a whirl if he's game. It may be more suited to his skin. (I'd also really like to smell it on someone else.) Truely love the vanilla scent this gives! Suitable when you are wearing dark color clothes or leather jacket. I can still smell it even with mask on. Advice is not to over spray... Hahaha. I think I just choked the train car with vanilla.
Edit: Wearing it again today and have the feel that the drydown smells a bit like Creed Aventus. Really poor performance......
Longevity I only got 4 days then it became a skin scent.
Projection is maximum 200km, I’ve got a friend in Japan and he only got a faint whiff in the air.
Phenomenal fragrance! Tobacco Vanille clearly splits opinion and perception, likely because it seems to be extremely sensitive to body chemistry. Even on myself, there are noticeable differences day to day. Most of the time the little variances are lovely, but occasionally it’s a bit ashy —  not unlike my experience with Tea for Two.
I very, very much recommend trying this more than once, whether you love it or hate it on the first try. See if it changes. This is not a blind buy.
For me, in a word: perfection.
On my skin, most of the time it’s tobacco from the top. A lovely, warm pipe tobacco. The vanilla is there — or more accurately, it’s like the crispness of vanilla sugar — as is the sweetness of dried fruit and tonka, but on me those are secondary until the heart starts to come through and the tobacco blends a little more with the vanilla. The dry-down lasts forever, through showering and sleep, a lovely, warm, sweet skin scent still there in the morning. For me, it’s never been cloying.
I definitely reach for this more in the cold seasons, but it’s not entirely out of place in the summer either. Very much unisex — I think it’s more the chemistry that determines for whom it works than any notion of femininity or masculinity.
My closest comparison will be my other favorite, Tauer’s Vanilla Flash. I’ve seen differing opinions on this too, but for me VF is maybe a little more complex, a little more nuanced, a little more spicy — perhaps from the signature rose in there. But the straightforwardness of Tobacco Vanille is a feature when the blend is just so right.
Over where I live, people are pretty restrained. But Tobacco Vanille seems to be something that melts even that reticence and elicits compliments. That, for me, is high praise.
I noticed a review saying “four spritzes is enough”, and frankly that frightened me! To me, using that much either says that it’s a faulty bottle, or a very desensitized nose. Just a single spritz on the wrist or neck will last me an entire day with maybe a refresh if I want more of the top and heart than the dry-down for the evening. Sillage is just about perfect after the initial blast of about 30 minutes — I try to avoid being in confined places before that, because it can be overpowering to people. After that, though, it’s easily noticeable from a couple meters away without (I think) being offensively strong.
As is the case with all the Private Blends, Tobacco Vanille is overpriced. Not because the quality isn’t there, but because the price is simply too high for any scent. And that said, I have and will spend too much on it because I love it. What a lovely perfume! It's warm and cozy, has a gentle vanilla scent, and is a teeny, tiny bit gourmand. While it's slightly sweet, this is no typical Willie Wonka perfume, like we're seeing EVERYWHERE.
Bonus - if you mix it with Tom Ford's Bitter Peach, it'll add a bit of something special and you'll be extra happy!
Also, buy the body spray. It's $75, (in contrast to the couple hundred the perfume costs) and the staying power is fabulous! Tobacco Vanille is phenomenal... if you smell it once in a while. It’s a sweet spicy fruity gourmand perfume and wearing it becomes a struggle after a couple of hours - for me. 
Yes, you can smell the tobacco leaf amidst the blend, but it’s mainly a spicy (clove and cinnamon) vanilla combo. 
There’s a popular dessert here in Brasil called “pão de mel” (“honey bread” in a literal translation). And, being totally simplistic, that’s what Tobacco Vanille is to me: the scent of “pão de mel”. So much so that I can’t even go further in any “note breakdown analysis”. 
I hope, from the bottom of my heart, that my opinion about it would change, because,
otherwise, I’m stuck with a 100ml bottle of a perfume that I haven’t really learned how to appreciate (imagine the buyer’s remorse of being hooked by the hype - once again - I’m going through right now... when will I learn?) I finally received a sample of this through a swap and then bought a small bottle. I did not know I needed it until I had it. This is AMAZING! I wasn't convinced I'd like it because of the tobacco, but it's rich, thick, smokey vanilla with hints of cherry in the background. Those who mentioned Michael's around Christmas time, yasss! That scent, elevated!
It also reminded me of sitting in a lounge in an upscale Caribbean resort, wearing a vanilla scent, sipping on a fruity drink, while a couple people are smoking cigars somewhere around. The story begins with the first spray of perfume where there is a quarrel between the soft vanilla and the masculine tonka bean amid intense pressure from the tobacco note to break the quarrel. This opening is the reason many people hate this fragrance. The softness of vanilla and the masculinity of the tonka bean is a contradiction; This is not the shouting of tobacco loudly to calm the situation (as opposed to the hallway and the sobriety known to the cigar owners). No wonder there are people who did not understand or hate this beginning. After this debate comes a sharp note of spice, calming the situation and changing the course of the situation from quarrels to the utmost intimacy. So vanilla reveals its beauty and appears in its most beautiful guise. Tonka bounces comfort and spreads its charm and elegance. Amid confident laughs of tobacco indicating that the situation is stable. After the reconciliation and the clarity of the atmosphere, the tobacco note relaxes, lights her cigars and orders a cocoa cake with three hot chocolate delivery from one of the upscale cafes. And to the honesty, this is what happens in this perfume, a quarrel, a reconciliation, a wrapping it, and a peace of mind that accompanies the smell of cocoa. Tobacco Vanille perfume is a masterpiece and one of the finest Tom Ford perfumes. And the most complex of them and distinguished with (Tuscan Leather of course). Truth be told, you don't find perfume on the market right now. Show tobacco like this. I also pay tribute to the delicate sense of Tom Ford, where the vanilla in this fragrance was most beautifully presented, in the manner of the distinguished perfumer Jean Paul Gerlan. This fragrance is night and winter first class. With a fairly masculine degree. Stability: Extra Strength. One of the most stable perfumes. The persistence of this fragrance makes its high value it deserves. Al-Fouhan: high permeability and striking force for five hours at worst. I really enjoy this one. Top notes are an almost medicinal, sharp clove-tobacco scent, but then the dry down in about 30 minutes turns a woody, creamy vanilla! I would recommend this one to those who love vanillas! Reminds me a little of my Mancera Aoud Vanille. This is beautiful. I don't get tobacco but I do get a chocolate chip mint. It smells like chocolate chip mint ice cream on my skin. The dry down is absolutly gorgeous! It lasts forever! Sillage is incredible. I was going to swap it but after wearing it one more time in the freezing cold weather I have to keep it! Oh, boy, this is SO good. I hesitated on getting a decant of this because the tobacco in the name and as a note really did not appeal to me. Reading reviews saying it smells like cigarettes also made me unsure if I should try it out. But I did. This doesn't smell like cigarettes on me at all thankfully. It smells like a chai tea latte, which others have mentioned below. It's funny because I sprayed this and immediately the spice came through so, so strong. It wasn't unappealing, but if you are spice averse in your fragrances, you might hate this upon the first spray. But the vanilla comes in and transforms the spice into a creamy, complex chai. Strong projection, still testing longevity. Really enjoyable. Became one of my favorite scents, the dry down even better, sweety tobaccoish vanillic and fruity, really the atmosphere affects the scent, I usually don’t like sweet scents just a few, I layer it with Layton “imo amazing dry down” and sometimes with polo green gives it a green smoky aspect” it works with me”. Im a huge Tom Ford fan in general, but this one is just not for me, just way too sweet. I barely get the tobacco and its just a tsunami of confectionary vanilla to my nose. Everyone else seems to love it, so maybe its me. I don't know how many people have smelled a tobacco leaf but this is on the money. I get the cloves but very faint. I smell mostly tobacco for about an hour. Then the fragrance starts to bloom into a combination of the other notes. The Vanilla and Spices becomes more prominent in the mid. I am not a fragrance connoisseur so the remaining notes do not particularly stand out to me but I do pick out the woods and they help to ground the tobacco and vanilla in the dry down. This is love in liquid form.
My husband brought this to me as a sample on a tester paper the other morning and I carried it around all day smelling it.
Today I went to the mall and decided to try it on my person to see if the chemistry works well with me, YES it does. She sprayed me up all the way (talking around 10 sprays, which I'm now aware is a lot for this to most people, but it was perfect for me). The lasting power is good. It stayed with my all day, though it has weakened a lot now that it's been about 12h later. The best part was I could smell it on myself as I moved throughout the day, even hours later, without being overwhelmed. It's just a breath of ""yum"". The store worker thought it was a bit daring for me to wear it on it's own, being a woman in my 20's. She said she usually mixes it with something more feminine so it's not so masculine but I would not mess with perfection. Though I've read reviews of women saying it leans more masculine and men saying it leans more feminine, I personally think it's exactly unisex. Tom Ford knew what he was doing when he labeled it exactly that, Unisex. Because this masterpiece does not belong to a single gender, ANYONE would smell fantastic in this. Sharing is caring! 
To me it's sweet and tobacco, it's amazing, it's love. If my inner-world had a scent it would be this. It's so cozy and beautiful, sexy and warm. When I have it on I feel like I'm weightless, floating on my own cloud of bliss. It's my heart's home and it speaks comfort to my senses. 
I didn't know of all the hype around Tom Ford scents or Tobacco Vanille before I first smelled it, but learning of it now, i get it. It's honestly quite pricey for me and I likely would have never had a second thought to try it if my husband didn't decide to put it on a tester strip randomly for me to smell. I am eternally grateful for the introduction to this scent. Now that I've smelled it, it's my mission in life to have a bottle in my possession at all times. xD
Please never discontinue. I was drawn in by the story of the fragrance, Tom Ford recreating the smell/feel of upscale fancy lounges in London. Smelled the fragrance and could absolutely get the feeling of sitting in a leather chair, having brandy, smoking a cigar, and discussions with my “mates” (I’m American I’m not sure if I’m allowed to use that word).
My daughter smelled it and loved it. She wore before I did, and it was different on her. The spices and vanilla sweetness came right out.
Then, I wore it, and same.
It is a great fragrance, I gave her the bottle as I don’t like how it sits on my skin. Don’t shy away from it, my suggestion is that it’s not a blind buy fragrance, and don’t rely on a tester strip. Get it on your skin and test it out first. I’m not sure how women pull this off. I straight up asked my dad if this is a fragrance he would want to smell on my mother and he was repulsed 😂. Thankfully it’s just a sample. Maybe I don't know what actual tobacco leaf smells like. Maybe I'm basic. A philistine perfume fan for sure, but I get almost no tobacco from this. Just cloves and Jim Beam. Reminds me of Djarum Blacks and Giuliani Manhattan. Tobacco Vanille is one of the sexiest, most endearing, and elegantly crafted fragrances that I've ever had the pleasure of owning. On my skin, I get a beautifully spicy vanilla opening that dries down into a gorgeous vanilla pipe tobacco with hints of a complex cocoa/dark chocolate and ever-so-subtle fruitiness that I can't quite put my nose on.
Projection on this is nuclear, and I often catch myself frequently smelling that indulgent vanilla pipe tobacco note throughout the 12+ hours of longevity I get. TV is a fragrance that announces your presence for you as you walk through doors, not the other way around. As a caveat to that, I find that it's not a typical work-friendly day fragrance for most people and wears easier during the colder times of the year.
To me, this is the best of the Tom Ford Private Blend. tobacco vanille opens with a huge cloves bomb. the vanilla slowly appears and becomes truly clear 1½ hour later. on my skin, i could only smell these two. cloves, then vanilla 1½ hour later. they blend beautifully, but i couldn't pick up tobacco at all. plus, it only lasts 4 hours on my skin idky :( 
but on fabric, it's a little bit different. its similar in terms where it opens with cloves. but 1½ hour later the vanilla appears, albeit very faint. and i could pick up other notes like dried fruits, honey and tobacco (even though honey isn't written as a note), which also are all quite faint. this is bcs the cloves note is very dominant on fabric. the cloves is very dominant, they could've named it ""cloves vanille"" haha. 
to me, the vanilla in TV is more ""in the air"" rather than on the skin/fabric. i did the sillage test where i spray this on my pillow, hours later got out of the room and came back in after a few minutes to find the room smelling like vanilla, which apparently is more prominent than it is on my skin and fabric too! also,,, the ""in the air"" scent lasts only 4 hours, just like it does on my skin. though it does last longer on fabric, like any other fragrance. 
sorry it's a bit long. that's my take on TF's TV, and i respect any difference in opinions :) have a good day! One of my all time favourites. I've had a few small decants and just love the hell out of this stuff. Rich, slightly sweet, and POWERFUL. Like good vanilla pipe tobacco, but complex enough to pull it off. Pity it's so damn expensve. It's good. Almost worth the price. If I ever find a good deal I'll go in for a 150ml. What a strange journey this scent has been. I picked up a sample and all I could smell was a decadent Vanilla that radiated with my body heat. It pulsed and lived as though I was in a bakery getting ready to make treats for the family. I woke up the next day and I could still smell it around me. that's when I knew I wanted it.
So I ordered the 250 ml from Tom Fords site. I hated it when I tried it. There was an opening scent of christmas. Not sure what to call it but it smells just like the christmas aisle where they have all the wreaths. It was all I could smell. That was about a month ago. I don't know if my batch matured after being opened and exposed to air or if my nose is just getting better trained but I'm starting to get bathed in that rich decadent vanilla again. It sadly doesn't have the power of my sample but after letting my batch mature and grow, it's quickly my daily driver for this winter. Tobacco vanille is a great perfume , that starts with a sweet tobacco and spice principally black pepper, which mellows down after 15 minutes, that’s where the vanilla and cocoa comes in and that is when I start to like the scent . This a must have and it is very nice in the cold basically an Ac setting Tobacco Vanille is a pretty sweet scent, so if that turns you off you may not like this one. The sweetness is a bit stronger than the tobacco, and it's very reminiscent of a sticky honey scent. I get major honey vibes, and I think it's the dried fruit playing with the vanilla and tonka beans. The tobacco is definitely there though and plays off nicely with the sweetness.
The fragrance is quite linear: it's basically the tobacco honeyed sweetness and it's quite strong but pretty enjoyable in my opinion. The sweet smell is lovely smelling and not synthetic, but thick and rich. There's a small hint of spice and wood but it's in the background. Performance is pretty good as well.
This is certainly a scent that is very present- there's no subtlety about it, but it's warm and comforting- not harsh and abrasive, and I think it's perfectly unisex as well. I don't get much tobacco and though there isn't any honey it smells like it. Tobacco Vanille is very intensive, strong perfume. It is definitely not for everybody and I recomend to try it before buy. It is not for everyday use, maybe for somebody, who feels (or wants to feel) confident, strong, powerful and extravagant every day. Perfume starts very strong, you could say an alcohol feel, but then it goes into warm sweet tones, but as it is unisex, it's not like a mouth-sticking candy, which I appreciate. You have to be prepare that you will smell the perfume from yourself a whole day, which can be for somebody annoying and I can imagine it brings headache to somebody sensitive. But for people who like heavy intensive perfumes is this a good choice. For me it's one of my most favourite perfumes I have. I am not sure about this.
I have this perfume in decanter. This is one of the perfumes that I've been dying to try. 
I REALLY love the vanilla note; it's sweet, it's warm, it's charming. But as for the other notes...it smells like the traditional Indonesian massage oil. It's spicy, but not in a very pleasant way.
I get how this fragrance would smell in colder climate and why people love it.
I just can't pull this off :'( If you're looking to buy this go through fragranceswap on reddit, I got this used 80% for 125$. The fragrance itself is awesome. I will wear this to every christmas, thanksgiving, and interview. I swear this is something Seneca, or Marcus Aurelius would wear. This is not particularly seductive but more noble and formal. I swear that My favorite fragrance for men, but I have to use it sparingly since it's so expensive normally. It was a blind buy for me but the best blind buy so far, which is all of my purchases since small town. The basic scent is very pleasant in itself, but as a personal perfume, this feels as suitable as a 6-pound chocolate cake on Monday for breakfast. There is something in tobacco vanille that everyone must keep it in mind before trying it.
( if your backgrounds about men fragrances are basic designers, citrusy and a bit woody types of fragrances, I will tell you “your nose will be shocked when you first try tobacco vanille”)
The reason is that tobacco vanille has a real smell of fresh tobacco leaf and every note in TV is done with full of creativity that no one did it before and until now after all these years still there is nothing can beat TV.
So I wanna tell these people who talk shit about TV “train your nose and take a look on niche perfumery world and then try to judge TV fairly”.
MAN just take a look on how the most masculine sweet note (tobacco) meets the most feminine sweet note (vanille) to create this unisex masterpiece.
Wow can’t say more. A good fragrance but definitely not for everyone. I do not like the opening at all but the dry down smells good. Longevity is amazing, sprayed my clothes and i could smell it for days. Silage is good too. 
Overall rating: 7.3 Tobacco Vanille is charismatic, bold, powerful, sexy and delicious.
For many reasons, Tobacco Vanille reminds me of Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) in House Of Cards. Scent: 7/10
Longevity: 10/10
Sillage: 8/10
Versatility: 3/10
Overall: 7/10
Very Tom Ford, bold, powerful, undeniable presence. Befitting for fancy night out and black tie events. Definitely not an easy to wear frag. I put this on my collar then get on packed train and end up choking other passengers. The smell is so long lasting it even causes me headache. The Tom Ford line is unbelievable. I've sampled only 4 of them, and so far three of them have taken best-in-slot for me. Grey Vetiver is my favorite Fresh Vetiver, Ombre Leather is my favorite Leather, and now this is my favorite Vanilla fragrance. I generally don't like Vanilla fragrances (especially when powdery), which is why this one surprises me. It is one of only 2 Vanilla fragrances I like, yet it has zoomed all the way to my top 7 fragrances across all genres. This is an amazing tobacco-vanilla scent -- where for a change, the tobacco is in a support role instead of the lead. And it works really well, in my humble point of view.
This lasts a long time on me... I didn't need a re-spray the whole day from 8 to 5pm. Even after a shower, I could still smell traces of it on my wrist. It can also fill a room. Immediately after using 4 sprays, my wife smiled across the room. She loves Vanilla, and for a change I agree with her. If this weren't so pricey, I'd buy one for Christmas. However, I'm still waiting for my Grey Vetiver to arrive and am about to place an order for Ombre Leather... so this will have to wait until 2021. I would recommend this to everyone, but apparently this is a polarizing fragrance... so try first before you buy. But this is a LOVE for me. My Profile: 24-year old female
First Impression: Incredibly harsh! I immediately wanted to take this perfume off me. I felt intoxicated and smelt as if I had just come from a Bar and absorbed all the smells of alcohol and cigarette smoke.
The Dry Down: Still pretty harsh and the smell is definitely emanating into my nose every time I breathe in. It smells like a combination of Spices, Pepper, Vanilla, Tobacco, and a lot like Potpurri. 
Final Thoughts: I personally hate it, it's given me a slight headache, and I genuinely feel sick wearing it as if I'm going to throw up! I felt self-conscious the entire time I wore this as if people were scrunching their noses when I was around. This perfume will definitely fill the room, so be mindful of that. Don't blind buy, get a sample. I think it would suit men more than women, but particular women I feel could pull this off. Decided to splurge on this as a gift for my boyfriend, I sniffed just a tiny bit of it at the counter and I instantly loved it. Kinda worried that my boyfriend won't love it though but I bought it anyways since if he didn't liked it then I could wear it. Thankfully, he absolutely loved it. I LOVE this scent on him, it is INTENSELY sexy. One spray of it can make me go wild about him. It smells of cigarettes, with undertones of vanilla and some hints of spices that are so delectable. It weirdly goes well with my Marc Jacobs Daisy Eau So Fresh, its like the feminine type of this perfume. If you love heavy spices, a whiff of vanilla and cigarettes then this is for you. I love this because, this feels like this is my boyfriend's signature scent even before he wore this. He constantly smells like cigarettes and he wears spices perfumes before this one, add vanilla to the mix and voila, Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille is his long awaited scent. Be very wary though because this is a very strong and a very heavy scent and it lasts forever, in his case at least. This is a unique and polarizing fragrance for sure so seriously don’t blind buy it - it’s too expensive to risk it. It’s very much an acquired taste. 
I happen to love this fragrance. I don’t wear it or own a bottle, but an ex-boyfriend of mine used to wear it and he smelled absolutely incredible. It’s smokey and sweet with hints of spices in all the right places. It’s bold, yet very smooth and blended well. The vanilla is so luxe in this one. It’s a gorgeous warm and rich fragrance to wear during colder months. The lasting power is 10/10. I don’t smoke, but if you are a smoker, I feel like Tobacco Vanille would work well to hide the scent of cigarettes because of the deep tobacco note blended with the smooth vanilla.
I’m a sucker for Tom Ford packaging. The black and gold bottle is striking. I just love it, nothing else to note. Wow, this caught me off guard. I picked up a sample because of the hype, and because I wasn't too big a fan of Herod which people compared this to. To my nose, Herod is a cherry pipe tobacco through and through. This is different. This reminds me of Christmas when I was a kid and my mom would put out these wax candles to make the house smell like holiday spices. It's definitely tobacco + vanilla, but not like I've smelled before, where the notes were blended to invoke other memories. This is like deliberate in-your-face tobacco leaf plus some warm, cozy, slightly spicy vanilla. Quite intriguing. Quite strong. Straight down the middle unisex. Smooth, buttery sweet in the dry down, like distant fresh baked gingerbread and vanilla candles. VERY good longevity on my skin. very unique and special scent , the well blended between tobacco and vanilla will give you the happiness 
a must in each collection but never blind buy it 
performance & sillage ? don't worry it's one of the best TOM Ford fragrances I honestly have to say it didn't meet my expectations. I feel I was wrong to have any in first place, but I did. 
I did expect it to be something between Noir Extreme and Tobacco Oud.
Meanwhile it is completely different smell. 
Is it bad? Not at all, but I am not enjoying it as much, just because I did expect something totally different. That's simply my fault. 
Although it is an interesting and quite unique smell, I myself wouldn't consider it as unisex. To me personally it fits more for ladies. Which is quite weird, because I have no problem wearing Extreme Noir, which seems to be more sweet and ""flamboyant"". 
I think that it has quite intense opening, which might be the reason I don't enjoy it as much, because the longer it dries down, the more I like it. 
Anyways, me personally I won't be wearing it much often, and I'm glad I got only a decant instead of buying a whole bottle. Because it wouldn't be used by me that much. Given the reviews, I had such high hopes for this. I really wanted to like it but alas, it smells VILE to me. Such a shame, as I have and love TF's Noir de Noir and Oud Fleur. TV however, just smells like a dirty ashtray with a drop of two of cheap vanilla cologne. I tried a single spray on my wrist. It did soften somewhat after an hour, and the vanilla came through a bit more, but the overwhelming ashtray scent was just too much for me. This was my first test of a tobacco note - safe to say it's not the note for me. 话梅 “huamei”, an Asian snack made of pickled ume/preserved plum: this is exactly what Tobacco Vanille smells like. Ask any east or southeast Asian you know, they'll agree.
I googled a little more, then found what's responsible for that distinctive scent of huamei(=Tobacco Vanille):Licorice.
To replicate this scent with 100% precision, first you need some extremely tart fruits, too sour to be eat alone, let them dried up with salt, treat them with a shit load of licorice, sprinkle them with cinnamon and clove powder, and round off the rough edges with vanillin: now you got the perfect Tobacco Vanille opening.
The latter half of the journey, if you ask me, mimics another Asian drink: rose oolong tea.
Oolong tea is a type of half fermented ""black"" black tea, smells incredibly dry and bitter with a whiff of ""rusty"" fermented hint
Getting close to your skin, the bitter and dried core of Tobacco Vanille smells exactly like dried oolong tea leaves; smells from afar, it has a hidden rosy aura.
The dry down has lost its shape, just a vague mix of all aforementioned notes, maybe adding some oily-coconut-y coumarin, along with a few drop of honey adding a little depth and animalic hint. Signature Christmas scent for me, for the last 5 years or so, and never fails!
And th scent, though not smelling straight up different, has nice subtle nuances... Sometimes I get more honey, sometimes more Vanilla, sometimes raisins (dried fruits?), sometimes chocolate and wearing it again today after more than 8 months, it does have a beautiful cinnamon-y edge this time (must be the cloves getting less 'mentholey')... All these nuances definitely remind me of Christmas season... But make no mistake, it is still ""Tobacco Vanille"" at its core!
A masterpiece, but to wear sporadically because it can get tiresome pretty quick, and only for Fall/winter due to his great performance... Hated it when I smelled it 5 years ago. It's decent now but I don't love it enough to buy. Smells better when I pair it with other fragrances. Not enough Vanilla, smell reminds me of a Thanksgiving hand basket. Good to wear with a suit. Stick your nose into a jar of cloudy honey. That's what it smells like. I feel like I'm a bee inside of a honeycomb with this, love it. I don't know why, but every tobacco smells like honey to me until it gets burned. I love it so much! It's a delicious, dark, rich, warm gourmand, but a gourmand you wouldn't really eat. 
The vanilla in this reminds me of the vanilla essence that my grandmother used to add to cozonac (romanian desert). 
So spicy and sweet, very strong lasting power! It lasts 24 hours on me, if not more. 
Delicious tobacco smell, super smokey and powerful.
I mostly wear it when I'm dressed in black, brown or red, since I feel like it really compliments those colors. This is by far my favorite Tom Ford offering. It is a true masterpiece in my opinion, and exactly the kind of fragrance that reminds me why i love this hobby so much :)
The ""My favorite fragrances"" section on my fragrantica profile has remained largely unchanged for a few years now, but i'll definitely be adding this to my top 5.
Hats off to Tom Ford, who is a master of his craft. It is a top tier fragrance, but slowly getting overrated IMO. Sweet spicy vanilla. It smells good when it lingers in the air. Up close I am not a big fan. It does the job. For colder weather. I do get some chocolate smell out of it. You might want to try Fèves Délicieuse by Dior instead. Similar but way better, Classy!!!
I blind bought TV after reading the much love/hate reviews from different people and boy was i in for a surprise..
When my bottle arrived (on a friday) i immediately sprayed it on a piece of paper in my office and it was love at first sniff.
Come monday when i got back to work, my office smelled heavenly. The combinations of the tobacco, tonka bean, cacao vanilla and dried fruits gives the masterpiece a balance on all edges. It's spicy, warm, bold, sexy, luxurious and damn beautiful.. This is separates the MEN from the boys, Mr Ford this is your best work!!!
Performane 10/10
Longevity 10/10
Sillage 10/10
Overall 10/10 The name alone tells you most everything you need to know about this fragrance, but because I like to be longwinded, I’ll say more. What’s offered here is a sweet and spicy tobacco. You get aromatic properties wafting above vanilla and dried fruits. It creates a distinguished, mature scent that leans masculine to my nose. Well suited to a black jacket as well as a warm sweater, Tobacco Vanille is a fragrance that projects an aura of authority, while still remaining approachable and welcoming. The spiciness mixes with a dried fruitiness to create a very homey fragrance that may even resemble scents associated with holidays. On my skin, more sweetness comes out than on paper, making Tobacco Vanille warm and very cozy. This also keeps the fragrance in firm unisex territory, even if I find it leaning masculine through the total experience. Regardless, a perfect choice for when the leaves begin to change color and fall from the trees.
I’m reasonably certain Tobacco Vanille has earned its place as a classic and it’s easy to recognize as such from the first sniff. The joy of the wear is how the fragrance reveals its different facets and complexity as time goes on. I really wish Tom Ford would introduce this into his Signature Line and make it more affordable. As it is though, Tobacco Vanille is certainly on the shortlist of fragrances everyone new to the hobby might like to get acquainted with, especially if interested in fragrances for the colder months.. I’m fairly certain Toboacco Vanille is one of Tom Ford’s most well-known fragrances, and assuming I’m correct, it’s easy to see why. This is a rich and rewarding fragrance that illustrates the motifs of the house. As such, it serves as a perfect introduction to a major brand and voice. Commanding, indulgent and sexy under the right circumstances, Tobacco Vanille is a beautifully blended fragrance that plays on the opposites of strong and sweet. A serious candidate for inclusion in the Fragrance Hall of Fame. This scent is a complete time machine- it takes me back 15+ odd years when I rolled my own cigarettes and ventured into playful trial with coarse flavoured pipe-tobacco for many months. I had two faves, cherry and plum, especially the latter - giving absolutely exquisite delicious olfactory trail often complimented. It didn't smell like anything remotely similar to sharp disgusting aftermath of a real cigarette, but was instead sweet, fruity, slightly dark and aromatic. It was my secret conversation starter over many parties until I finally got a bit tired and even sick of it. 
TF Tobacco Vanille is the exact replica of this scent, it even brings about nausea I once felt after over-doing my roll-ups. Photo-realistic plum pipe tobacco with artificial sweetness. It doesn't change in development, keeping the fruity note for hours in contrast with smokiness.
I fully understand the attraction, but for me its quite a simple scent. And it is strange to hear so much about TV only to discover its all about bog-standard flavoured pipe tobacco. There is nothing missing, nothing extra. Perhaps TV comes across too sweet on woman's skin and plays more intresting on men. More woody? more spicy? chocolate? some cinnamon even? On me it just candied plum and tobacco, so not super impressed. Btw, its much better as a trail from a slight distance, not for wrist sniffing. The opening note of Tobacco Vanille is so wonderful - it really reminds me of sniffing my uncle's tobacco before he'd roll a cigarette, a scent I have always loved. As it dries down, TV becomes increasingly sweet. In that stage it lasts on me forever - I usually spray this in the evening and still smell it when I wake up. 
I've heard a lot of people describe this as sexy, and I guess it could be, but for me this is the more of a home alone, time to kick back scent. It also is Christmassy, as many have noted, yes - something in here reminds me of the heat of a room in December while everyone is eating and drinking.
Wouldn't buy a full bottle for perhaps that very reason - it's a wonderfully indulgent, gluttonous fragrance - but I really love wearing my decant every now and then. Comforting and delicious, in small doses; just like Christmas. I am dazzled by the beauty of this exquisite blend. Tobacco, vanilla, cinnamon , apricot and honey in a silk velvet scent that is so smoothly addictive one is bound to give in. One of the very best perfumes under the Tom Ford label. Its creator, Olivier Gillotin, is also the man who has given us another one of the very best in this line, namely Tobacco Oud. Love at first sniff!
Smelled decent on opening, walked around for 30 mins, sniffed again and O.M.G....""Yum!""
There is a hidden note of cinnamon here. Near a true masterpiece, but not a perfect 10/10, feels too linear simple of ingredients to label it that, but damn well pretty close! This is SEXY!!! It's so fucking good on the dry-off that i can't stop smelling myself. Im trying to be careful as a new enthusiast on buying up too many bottles which i later label 'above average', but this scent is an instant buy! One of my fav vanilla colognes ive smelled to date entering the niche zone. 
Smells like rich aged real vanilla sitting in your cubard for a long time, dried fruits, a hint of quality pipe tobacco that is not over-powering where it compliments the other note perfectly, and it's also decently blended, but does give a slightly sourness to the frag which some tobaccos are known to do. But, the ingredients do smell not fresh, like old sitting in the kitchen cupboard for too long to use...lol Doesn't perform as good as 'Black Phantom' in every way, smaller scent bubble, smaller longevity, could barely smell it on me when i wore both of them on my arms, but i could smell 'Black Phantom'. I will also add that 'Herod' by Parfums De Marly is absolutely better than this as well in every way - richer in scent, superior quality in scent, silage, scent bubble, better quality ingredients, dark rich and fresher. So Tom Ford's Tobacco Vanille is 3rd Place in my books to date for this frag's scent genre of tobacco/vanilla combo.
4/5 Woofs! Gucci Pour Homme II! Cinnamon To my nose.......this starts off with the tobacco note and the spicy note, the spice fades quickly and the tobacoo becomes more dominant with the vanilla coming through lightly. Then the tobacco notes goes to the back ground and the vanilla starts to shine though, but never is the star ,since the tobacco is still faintly there and the cacao starts to come out. Performance is great, lasts most of the day. My bottle is brand new from a department store. This scent leans masculine to me, even though it is sweet. Some people say it smells like Christmas fruit cake, but I have never Tried a Christmas fruit cake with tobacco inside. The tobacco note is not a sweet cherry vibe, its definitely drier. I would try before I buy. 9/10 Some scents have the power to make us feel many things on many levels. TV is one of these. Some scents evoke eras, like the 80's, 90's, retro vintage and modern. TV is one of these. 
For myself, I love to wear TV to feel confident and refined. The spice, tobac, and vanilla creates an almost touchable cloud around you, never brash, shrill or abrasive. Peaceful, beguiling, enticing and gentle is this cloud. Hypnotic stuff!
If you imagine lying on a rattan deck chair on a deco 1930's ocean liner, sipping a manhattan, carefree. Dressed in a Cary Grant style grey suit complete with the dark stylish sunnies. This is Tobacco Vanille for me! Lovely! Top: tobacco leaf and spicy notes
Middle: tonka bean, tobacco blossom, vanilla and cacao Base: dried fruits and woody notes
This reminds me of fall. Like a candle or a high end version of that smell that hits you when you walk into Michael's Arts and Crafts. The spicy woods are there from the beginning. The dried fruits with the spices give it that Michael's smell that I'm talking about.
It becomes more sweet after the spicy opening dies down, probably because of the vanilla and cacao. I think the tobacco blossom and tonka bean give it a smooth dryness. 
This is a very beautiful scent, and I do like it a lot, but I just can't really see myself ever wearing it. I'm just not a fan of spiced fruit. Makes me feel like I'm smelling one of those holiday fruit cakes nobody eats. A tobacco scent cannot get better than this. No matter how many scents they create this is king of fall/winters.
This is the only scent I give 10/10. If you love the notes of tobacco and vanilla, you need to look no further. Beautiful, sensual, perhaps a tad masculine scent.
Fantastic performance as well, incredible longevity. Maybe the projection is not as strong as some make it sound, but this stuff definitely lasts ages.
One of the best scents for fall and winter.

Longevity 10/10
Projection 8/10
Sillage 8/10
Could be a cold weather signature fragrance. This has been my holy grail signature scent for several years. Smells amazing, sensual smoky sweet mysterious and rich. I like the kind of boozy scent this has. A brilliant dupe for this scent is LUSH’s Termeric Latte body spray. It’s £30 a bottle compared to 3 figures for a bottle of TF and in all honesty LUSH’s body sprays completely walk all over any high end fragrance performance wise If you love tobacco and vanilla notes in fragrances this is tobacco & Vanilla heaven DONE!!! No more words needs! I met a girl from Tinder recently and was trying to figure out which fragrance to wear. I noticed in one of her pictures she was staring hungrily at an incredible looking cake, so I went for this one. An hour or so into the date, a breeze blew from me to her, she stopped walking and asked in apparent disbelief if what she could smell was me. This confirmed my suspicion that TV is a god tier smell. I don't have the fragrance, but I tested a sample of it at the store. Just fyi, I'm 19, so I'm still pretty young. This was the first time I've ever smelt the tobacco scent, and I gotta tell y'all it knocked me off my feet. I was not expecting the pleasantness of the smell. The tobacco mixed with the sweet vanilla, just omg, SUPERB! I see a lot of reviews saying it's only for the mature, but I think it may work out on young adults too. It's absolutely captivating and seductive, it really spells out confidence as well as it charms. The dry-down of the scent is just as good. I only wish I could afford to buy a bottle of Tobacco Vanille, but unfortunately it's quite outside what I can afford. Masculine, Beast mode. A lot of dark side but sweet. You got smell as it name. Dark from Tobacco then sweet from Vanilla. Greatest tobacco scents for my taste.
Scents : 4.5/5
Longevity : 4.5/5
Sillage : 5/5 Please do not over-spray. The projection, Longevity and silage is extremely powerful and beast. I love this fragrance. I got compliment from this fragrance. Do not wear it on hot humid day. When it is cool or rainy weather, the aroma is a beast. 
Bottle: 9

Longevity: 10 ( based on my own experience, the fragrance last on me more than 15 hours) Sublime. People may write that they hate it, but ultimately this one is immortal. All at once it is vanilla cream custard, rich honeyed tobacco, dried Christmas fruits, fruitcakes dense with brandy, Yankee candles, hints of smoke and pine needles, a burst of tea, silken dense chocolat chaud a la Marie Antoinette (that is to say, dark and milk French chocolate melted in almond milk and cream, with vanilla pods), antique Cuban humidors. 
Many facetious remarks have addressed the disconnect between the English ""Tobacco"" and French ""Vanille"" of the name - perhaps it is a subtle nod to the concept of ""French Vanilla"" ice cream being deeper, denser, and sweeter with the addition of eggs as opposed to ""Philadelphia"" or ""American style"" Vanilla which goes without; therefore the vanilla in this corresponds to that French deeper, denser, sweeter vanilla accord. ""Tobacco French Vanilla"" doesn't roll off the tongue quite as well.
Between my 2015 bottle and my new 2020 one, I don't see any differences in longevity or sillage or complexity. This right here is simply amazing (you want to smell it all the time) and after knowing that H.Styles wears it too then definitely a top notch one... i was looking around to find a perfect vanille perfume and this one is right up my alley... why? because well it states it has tobacco in it so it perfectly balances out the vanille's strong sweetness- yet the tobacco itself isn't a vulgar type of, it is maybe a cocoa one as the previous reviewer said. 
My god the price, like i understand it is a high fashion brand but can we just stop and think of the idea of paying 170 euros for a 30 ml bottle????!!!?? need A DUPE!!!
It is not worth the money but it is a perfect vanille tobacco combination that i would love to have in my signature fragrances collection.
It is so strong that iT would be only for speciall occasions tbh. Tobacco Vanille. What a journey!
Definitely sublimated by the summer night heat. Dried fruit is plunged headlong, dipped in cherry liqueur. Black cherries, pine nuts, prunes, apricots, raisins all emerge alternately. Some dried figs are also figured and synthesized by the bitter taste of dryer peel.
Vanilla does not respond to my appeal. My relatively inexperience prevents me from recognizing it. In fact, I cannot say at what stage and level it appears.
My personal tastes thank the fact in this circumstance. There is no need for vanilla on this beautiful travel I follow to delight my senses.
A good lit cigar that yes, it wouldn't hurt. Smoked by a visitor in this cigar lounge, while ecstatic I sip this idyllic ""rhum"", so pleased and flattered, satisfied in taste.
It's a sensory walk so long, beautiful and comforting that I can only hope for a sequel, aspiring with imminence to find a place for Tobacco Vanille's orient next to my treasures. One of my favorites. I picked this up in an airport, and it's well worth the price. It smells sexy and sophisticated; the tobacco is realistic without smelling obnoxious. The vanilla ties in really well and tones down the harshness of the fragrance. Lasts all day and has pretty heavy sillage, at least for the first few hours. This is the first time I've been able to wear a tobacco fragrance out. 10/10. for those who are trying to substitute TF with Boclet - guys please consider that they're two different tobaccos! really, i have no idea who says they are alike, they are not, I've got both of them! TF is a deep tobacco but with cocoa and vanilla, full of sweetness. And Boclet's one is about hookah, the tobacco there is with the note of cherry or a prune! have it in mind, please! This smells like an amped up version of London by Burberry. A (waaaay) stronger (way too strong actually), vanillic London with more spices.
I'm disappointed to say the least, I expected something more refined, and way more special.
Don't know what the fuzz is all about. I have to admit the TF's Private Blend line is my cup of tea. I don't like all the blends but there are many I absolutely and Tobacco Vanille is one of them. It's rich and deep and dark, the vanilla is not too sweet, the tobacco is not too sharp. It's perfect.
I personally like Tobacco Vanille more than Vanille Fatale, although might have been a bad day when I tried VF. I might give it another sniff one day. I'm not saying that I want to smell like this for the rest of my life, but I probably want to smell like this for the rest of my life. Rich dry Tobacco develops into a vanilla sweet, smoky spiced blend that you want to eat. Lasts forever and a day, and on my skin not many things do. Masterfully created and signature worthy. I believe the hype! If you like the smell of tobacco, this is going to give you just that - the smell of high-quality, unburned tobacco leaves. Since I actually briefly smoked a pipe, and more for the smell than the nicotine, this is wonderful for me. The vanilla, too, comes in strong, but a lighter, airier vanilla, and not an ooey-gooey gourmandy one. It reminds me of the vanilla in Spiritueuse Double Vanille. Finally there is a tonka/spice spiciness hovering over things but not overpowering them. The spicy note reminded me of the ghost of the ghost of Grand Soir. 
This smelled the same on me start to finish - which made me very happy, since I did not want it to go away. I used to blend my tobacco before I roll
3 parts cherry tobacco + 1 part vanilla tobacco blended together and you will have vintage, dark, deep & strong Tobacco vanille.
The new formulation’s performance is a disgrace!!
It reminded me of smelling an empty tobacco plastic pouch, it holds a very faint smell of the blend. There certainly is no deception or false advertising in the name here, Tobacco Vanille is exactly that - unlit, sweet pipe tobacco. It smells very much like standing in the humidor of a fine tobacconist. No clove or cinnamon or old brandy to mix things up a bit - just lots of sweet vanilla tobacco (with maybe a leaf or two of cherry tobacco thrown in). It's an universally loved aroma, and this EDT recreates it almost perfectly. The trade-off is that there isn't a whole lot of depth or complexity to Tobacco Vanille. It's a great replication of a smell that already exists in the world, and whether or not that is a mark by which a great perfume is judged is open for debate. I don't understand the hype for this. The first 30-60 minutes it smells like a fruit cake and cough syrup. When it dries down it is tobacco, vanilla, and something else sweet. Others have mentioned honey so I will go with that. What a let down. Just Jack Tobacco Leaf 9€ 50ml.
Smell 95% same.
Your welcome! I loved it very much back in 2014 & 2015, but when I actually bought it in 2019 I got very disappointed of its performance.
Newer formula is obviously diluted, shame on them. Always had and always will love this. One of my all-time favorite perfumes ever. It was my early Tom Ford purchases that set me on my perfume journey from ordinary to extraordinary. May Tobacco Vanille continue unchanged for years to come. I am not going to break it down into its elements because for me the whole says it all. Love love love This is in my top 5 Tom Ford fragrances! I love the calmness it gives me when I wear it! It’s sweet but the tobacco is grounding it. Bought this for my bf and when he has it on (I told him it's a special occasion/date night cologne), I immediately want to cancel our plans, stay in and smell him all night. It smells like a kind gentlemen, or a very powerful sexy woman. Either way, it's amazing! If your s/o comes off nice but has a dark touch, or seems a bit mysterious with a kind soul, get them this. It's amazing. This smells like masculine tobacco and unisex vanilla,paired with woody notes, dried fruits and cacao. Best for: Evening wear and only in the winter. Long: 9- 11 h, proj: heavy. Overall rating: 10/ 10 the best tobacco ever I absolutely love this fragrance. A complete masterpiece in my opinion!
Just making things short: honey, vanilla and tobacco never were so good on my skin, and this combination stays and projects forever!
A MUST TRY for anyone who loves sweet fragrances. It could be a good gourmand. Too bad there's so many fakes it's slightly more feasible to buy ""cheap copy for cheap copy's price"" and save the ""price/quality"" ratio safe. Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille opens with a moderate projection of very sweet tobacco, vanilla, and tonka bean notes. Other than tobacco, the opening is very sweet and gourmand. The tobacco note in this fragrance is intense but aromatically soft, in other words, it feels like the scent of a blond, light-bodied, and very refined cigarette as opposed to the scent of a very dark and strong cigar. As the fragrance settles down, the dried fruit notes come up and intensify the already very sweet tones but they do not become prominent. The cacao, woody, and spicy notes are in the back, they contribute with a touch but nothing prominent. Once Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a moderate projecting, very sweet, blond tobacco, vanilla, and tonka bean fragrance with soft fruity, spicy, and woody notes. The fragrance feels fragrant, semi-gourmand, more masculine than feminine, mature, modern, natural, rich, sticky, very sweet, syrupy, warm, and pleasant.
BATCH REVIEWED: 2020.
WOW RATING: 6/10. It is a mildly pleasant fragrance; the tobacco note is overly refined.
DISLIKE RATING: 5/10. Some people will find the tobacco note somehow offensive although it feels very refined. The vanilla, tonka bean, and dried fruit tones are overly sweet. 
UNIQUENESS: 4/10. Tobacco fragrances are relatively common. Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille does not feel unique.
MASS APPEAL: 5/10. The tobacco is not a mass-appeal note.
PROJECTION: 4/10. Moderate, about 4 feet around the wearer.
SILLAGE: 4/10. Moderate, about 4 feet behind the wearer.
APPLICATION: Two to four atomizations will suffice. Additional atomizations will make the fragrance excessively sweet.
LONGEVITY: 4/10. Moderate, about four hours with 2 of good projection.
SEASONS: Winter and fall. The fragrance is excessively sweet for spring or summer.
OCCASIONS: Formal events, outdoor gatherings, casual, holidays, clubbing. 
VERSATILITY: 5/10. Limited to colder months and mostly casual occasions.
GENDER: Masculine. Advertised as unisex, the tobacco notes in this fragrance, although very refined, it is a masculine note.
AGES: 30 and above.
RECOMMENDATION: Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille can be found discounted for approximately $188 but just 1.7oz. Its cost/value ratio is very poor, furthermore, there are other fantastic tobacco fragrances with similar quality and performance priced more reasonably. Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille is a nice-to-have, but not a must-have.
BLIND-BUY: No, sample it first. The tobacco note is excessively refined and the sweetness is very high.
SIMILAR: The following fragrance contain tobacco and sweet notes, but don’t necessarily smell like Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille. John Varvatos Dark Rebel Rider, from the designer world, this fragrance is dark with incense, tobacco and leather notes, but moderate to low performance; similarly, John Varvatos Dark Rebel brings to the table woody, leathery, tobacco, spices, and boozy notes, a very masculine scent; Azzaro Wanted By Night EDP features tobacco, cinnamon, citrus, and vanilla notes and it is fantastic; Burberry London Men is a very affordable tobacco, cinnamon, woody, spicy and leather fragrance; Dolce & Gabbana The One EDP is a fantastic fragrance with good performance featuring amber, warm spicy, tobacco, aromatic, citrus, and sweet notes; Paco Rabanne 1 Million Prive EDP, combines tobacco, cinnamon, and orange notes creating a great performing fragrance; Parfums De Marly Herod Men EDP is a great niche, a tobacco-based fragrance with outstanding performance; Thierry Mugler - Angel A*Men Pure Havana may be one of the best bold tobacco-based designer fragrances; Cuba Royal Men EDT features vanilla, cedar, and tobacco notes and, it is very affordable; Animale by Animale is good tobacco, balsamic, and fruity fragrance with great longevity; Amouage Memoir Men EDP is a great niche, darker, tobacco, woods, incense, and leather fragrance; 
SUMMARY: A moderate projecting, very sweet, blond tobacco, vanilla, and tonka bean fragrance with soft fruity, spicy and woody notes, that feels fragrant, semi-gourmand, more masculine than feminine, mature, modern, natural, rich, sticky, very sweet, syrupy, warm, and pleasant. Please don't smell this on a tester papers! I thought it was a really mediocre fragrance the first two times I tested it at the retail counter. Then, by pure chance when I was bored testing some Creeds, I sprayed it on my skin, and it was MAGICAL. The first time ever I get so amazed. And now, I even think of it being better than the ever so hyped PDM CARLISLE!!
I haven't tested other people's reactions, but, I honestly don't care! I'ld pay the money to buy the state of mind this fragrance delivers.
Edit: After weeks of testing them side by side, I can confidently say, keeping in mind my big dislike of the brand of Tom Ford, that this is better than Carlisle.
Edit II: This has become my favorite fragrance of all time! I haven't tested thousands but I'm close and I can't find anything that gets close to this guy.... In the course of it's complexity and subtlety, I am beginning to see that it gives some mysterious vibes to the wearer. This is, and always will be, a masterpiece in my eyes. The sexiest scent I have ever experienced. Perfectly unisex. The price tag is eye-watering, but this baby is worth every cent. A smooth blend that cannot be replicated by dupes. Definitely for cold weather as its heavy, warming, spicy and lush - I definitely get a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove wrapped in a richly sweet vanilla. The tabacco is my favourite part of this. it's dusty, dry, velvety and oh so sexy. Probably the biggest compliment getter in my collection. I would never have guessed it would be since the tobacco and spicy notes definitely are noticeable, and not usually ""easy"" or mass appealing. In the dry down however, they get a little bit pushed to the side by the vanilla and that's usually about the time when people compliment me on my scent. It lasts an enormous amount of time and projects very nicely without being offensive. I would be a little cautious with wearing it in hot weather, although I have to admit, I have and didn't get any complaints. A beautiful nighttime scent, especially great for cozy scenarios during the fall and winter. Also, a perfect unisex scent that I love to share with my boyfriend. I highly recommend it! The real spice bomb!
This fragrance is very interesting. It's not what I expected. I would not call this sweet, this is in the spicy category for me. This smells like a spice cabinet that contains a fresh bag of pipe tobacco with some dark vanilla. I also smell cloves and cinnamon. It's a great fragrance, wonderful for winter and cold weather. This is not mass appealing at all, especially if worn in the wrong situation. If you're expecting this to smell like most other leather fragrances (like the inside of a new leather interior car), then you're in for a surprise. Imagine the kitchen in an old bakery in Germany cranking out fruitcake after fruitcake. This is an experience I haven't smelled before (on my skin). This is what I wish V&R Spicebomb smelled like. Get a sample to try before buying a bottle. Powerful, mass appealing and amazing. 
This is one of my favourite fragrances. This is a safe blind-but in my opinion. This smells sweet, but has this strong backbone of tobacco that runs throughout. This is simply an amazing scent. In terms of projection and sillage, this is just beastly on my skin. People can smell it all day, and people will definitely smell it walking past you and you will smoke out a room wearing a lot of this.

Longevity- 9/10
Sillage- 9/10 
Overall- 9/10 A Masterpiece from Mr Ford👌
Wicked combination of dried fruits, tobacco and vanilla. Getting a mad gingerbread vibe from it too. I can see why some people say that it’s Christmas I a bottle
Out of this world performance, getting 10+ hrs on skin and days on clothes!
Such a smooth fragrance from opening to dry down, a definite must try from the private blend collection It smells like a professional baker just baked a fruit cake inside an old cottage that also has a tobacco cabinet inside of it. Its absolutely amazing, but it's not for me. I get why people adore this and why it has so many positive reviews, it's a beast. Bold, warm, spicy! It delivers on the promise of tobacco and of vanilla, for sure, but when I reach for a scent with a monster performance like TV I cant handle all that sweetness on top of everything else. Stunning fragrance but sadly just not for me. Tobacco Vanille...this is what Angels smell like.
It is simply....GODLIKE A masterpiece of a fragrance. Love the tobacco and vanilla vibe. I can still smell it on my golf shirt that I wore a month ago. Beast mode I’ve worn two fragrances in my life. I like walking into my closet and smelling my fragrance and, sliding into bed and there’s my fragrance. Chanel cost engineered Egoiste. When Estée Lauder licensed the Tom Ford name his were cost engineered down. Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille is incredible. Strong and elegant. I’am not one of those men who think Winter,Summer or night or evening. Good god! It’s fragrance. Nothing more. I ware it ALL year MORING,NIGHT,NOON. My entire collection has been TWO. So two fragrances in 56 years. There’s something to be said for men who know what they want. And keep it. This one surprised me - I was imagining it very literally, vanilla and tobacco. This opens up to me like a spice cabinet - I think this would be a lovely scent for the month of October, it's a little bit witchy in a ""Practical Magic"" way. The scent of a kitchen witch! Love it. Batch review 2018.
Longevity : 8/10
Projection : 8/10
The opening is beautiful, this lasts for only 4 hours max on my clothes and after that its close to the skin. I still get whiffs of it but I don't think anyone else will.
This perfume is over hyped and over priced and the performance for this formulation is crap.
I won't suggest anyone to buy this batch, if you can get your hands on the older ones yes for sure
Wasn't expecting this from a Tom Ford and specially when the price tag is such high.
Edit: I take my words back, its extremely long lasting perfume. It probably will play tricks on your nose and make you think its not there but people around you will smell this on you for ages.
I applied a test of it at 10 am and could smell it easily on my shirt the next day afternoon. it doesnt last on me. not my type of tobacco scent anyway.
for me, mancera red tobacco or initio rehab much better scent and much more value for money. TF just way overpriced because of his name and he couldnt care less. u dont have the money then its not for u. people tend to be bias because of the brand TF. give it a blind test, they probably will choose others than this over hyped perfume. I've just tried a vintage-ish (2011-13, they were unsure when exactly) sample of this and it's completely different to the several modern samples I've tried. Completely. The liquid is darker, for starters, and it is much, much more pungent as a tobacco - rather than vanille - based scent.
That said...I'll be honest, I don't really like it. I 'get' the idea of it, I get the more artistic, sweet-smokey vibe it has, but I don't think it's a particularly alluring or comforting scent to wear, or for others to smell.
But it did make me wonder, as Tom Ford is absolutely churning out fragrances in the Private Blend at a rate of knots - I would really like Tom Ford to produce a Tobacco Vanille Intense.
We've had Oud Wood Intense. We've had Tuscan Leather Intense. We've had Tobacco Oud Intense. OWI is a big departure from the original, TLI a minor tweak of the original, and TOI is probably beteen the two, but closer to the original than OWI is to Oud Wood. I would really like Tom Ford to do to Tobacco Vanille what he/they did to Oud Wood by 'intensifying' it (stupid word in the grand scheme of things, but let's just accept it from a marketing perspective). If they could do something related to TV, but different enough in an interesting, more wearable way, I'd be intrigued. Because tobacco and sweetness...it could be a really killer masculine scent, which I'm not sure TV is (sorry TV fans).
It might be unlikely given how prominent vanilla and/or tonka and/or amber is used by the Tom Ford brand as well. Everything from Noir Extreme, to Metallique, to even the drydown of Beau de Jour seems to aim for sweetness. But I think there's a place to really develop the idea of tobacco and vanilla and do something...different. I'm not sure what. Maybe remove the fruity note, for starters, as I think that makes it a big weird and discordant. There might be room for bumping up the smokiness without getting in the the territory of Tobacco Oud Intense, while having it then cool off and drydown in to a more sweet, vanillic and amber base, as nearly all other Tom Ford scents do. At the moment, Tobacco Vanille is far, far too linear, and I'm not sure it really 'works' as a scent, to be honest. It's almost like layering two fragrances gone wrong - and I think, in defence of the reformulation, it's probably more wearable in its weaker, more vanillic form than it used to be, and it loses some of that discordant layering effect by focusing more on the sweeter side of things.
Anyway, we'll have to wait and see if they do realease a Tobacco Vanille Intense - and whether it meets some of my hopes, rather than...I mean, who knows? Who knows what it might be, actually - TV with an oud note thrown in?! As it is, I can totally see why wearers would want to seek out the vintage, as it's markedly different to the current formulation. Much stronger as well. I'm wearing another sweet/vanillic scent on my other wrist, same number of sprays (2), and it's like night and day in terms of projection. TV is 'beastly'. If you love TV as it is, then there are clear reasons to seek out older bottles. For me, I'm not going to do that, as I was given this sample by chance, and it's as far as I'll go with it. Just not for me.
*original review posted Nov 8 2019* I don't doubt that this is a good scent. And there is a part in the drydown, a good hour in, where I think I might even be able to wear this and come to love it.
But it's far too sweet, far too heady, and not my kind of style. It seems to be getting something of a backlash, presumably because sweet vanillic notes are now all the rage, particularly in designer scents.
That seems stupid to me. If you like this, or love it, wear it forever and embrace that. Because it's very good at what it does. But I don't like the blend of quite an earthy tobacco and the saccharine vanilla and fruity notes. There are so many better examples of vanilla or sweetness used 'well' by Tom Ford, namely Amber Absolute and Vanille Fatale, which I much prefer to TV (like taking Noir Extreme and adding this vanilla note).
This is beastly and quality and all those good things. But do not think this is an easy wear - a few samples/wears must be had at a minimum before thinking about buying it. It's not an easy wear for a man, even with the current state of maculinity in the Western world. Perversely, it's an even harder scent for a woman as it is still quite dark with the tobacco. Tricky indeed.
I'm not sure whether older forumlations of this would have been better - I believe certain notes have been added and/or subtracted since the first few years' of TV's existence.
A great perfume, but one that I cannot wear. I cannot see my 10ml vial ever being used, so I'll probably give this one away.
*original review posted Apr 7 2019* I have just discovered Tom Ford Fragrances. I feel in love with Rose Prick and have been trying out some of his other fragrances. This fragrance is very sweet and long lasting. Almost too sweet. But I love the way it evolves. I especially enjoy catching wisps of spicy - touches of cinnamon and cardamom. My husband loves it - he has a thing for vanilla and musks. ;-D (but what can I say) will not be a summer daytime fragrance for me but I like putting g a spritz on bare skin after my shower in the evenings and enjoying the tickle of fragrance I get through the night. Even if you cant afford a big bottle, just buy the 30ml. You wont regret it. But i do suggest you first sample it though, this might be to dense or thick for your liking. I have the 30ml bottle and only need 3 sprays max.
I attached so many memories to this scent and i’m sure you will as well. Very cozy en warm fragrance, sweet but not too sweet thanks to the tobacco. Perfect for the colder days and the silage is absolutely gorgeous. I smelled it on someone passing by, i think she had too many sprays on because she literally left a huge cloud trail behind her but in the air it smells absolutely stunning. Cant do without this one. 
Scent longevity etc all 10/10 for me. Although i don't think this will suit the summer.. To me, this perfume smells almost exactly like Celestial Seasonings African Red Herbal rea, Rooibos Vanilla. So much so, after the dry down, I can't tell for sure if there is a difference. The tea costs about $3, and you drink it. It's a beverage, not a perfume.
So yeah, that's disappointing. Of course it's still pleasant and it seems to last long. The perfume starts with a mix of cocoa-chocolate-vanilla liqueur, very sweet and very strong, gourmand by excellence, after which, it easily turns into a business in two: tobacco and vanilla.
This is a dry vanilla mixed with that tobacco used especially for pipe. If at first I thought I met a modern, gourmet perfume, especially for young people, its evolution will be more reminiscent of classic fragrances for men, intended more for mature clients.
Both the projection and the longevity are exceptional.
Although I see many reviewers complaining about the longevity or projection of some perfumes, I confess that I am satisfied, for example, with Dior Eau Sauvage. Maybe I was lucky enough to inherit a skin that doesn't so easily swallow the perfume. I make this mention because, after several hours of wearing, even a single application of Tobacco Vanille for me is too much - I feel overwhelmed and it gives me headaches.
Sorry, because I liked it a lot.
Fragrance 9/10
Projection High
Longevity 36 h It is a very sharp and a bit bitter and sweet at the same time.
Not for everybody but well blended and original.
I find it soothing to wear at night.
Hence Like and not Love :-)"
2,Un Jardin Sur Le Nil Hermès (unisex) ~ 2005," Really liked this today, fresh, hint of spice, natural, summery, quite different to almost everything I have at the moment. I want it quite badly now.. I don't pick any individual notes out, it's just a blend for me, but I prefer that. I tested this today on my wrist and it went straight to my ""must buy"" list. I love fresh, citrusy, green fragrances and this is a good one. I can see why another reviewer says this reminds them of Elizabeth Arden Green Tea, BUT I hate Elizabeth Arden Green Tea, and I LOVE Un Jardin Sur Le Nil. However, I also wish I hadn't read that...because my association with EA Green Tea is so negative that now I can't get the association out of my head, and when I smell Jardin Sur Le Nil on my wrist it starts to nauseate me. Booo! Maybe I can finagle a small, cheap bottle somewhere and give it a proper test drive for a few days and then decide.. Just wore this 3 days in a row.. I never do that with a frag......currently have no desire to wear anything else I’ll look at my shelf of a good probably 15 to 18 bottles and I don’t wanna wear anything but this starting pull stuff of the shelf for disposal including my Tom Ford’s... after so many years of searching I believe I have found my perfect signature everyday scent for warm weather .... ☺️☺️☺️☺️ This has a zinger of an opening - tart, in-your-face citrus freshness, almost too bitter, like someone chucking a gin & tonic in your face. It very quickly softens to something I really wasn't expecting. It has the best longevity of a citrus fragrance that I've experienced, but that is relative to other citrus frags - it's still pretty short-lived. But what remains is a delightful slightly spiced, slightly sweetened skin scent. I was expecting green herbal for the life of the scent, but what's there is much warmer and friendlier, while still retaining an outdoor, green note. I really like it. Sounds a bit odd, but this is the sort of frag I would wear on a long car/train journey. I get really motion sick, and fresh fragrances really help to lift me out of the headachey nausea. It's a personal one, stays close to the skin so it's for me and my tactile friends only. I quite like that - only if someone leans in will they get a waft.
updating this a few days later: I bloody love this!! Have worn it every day. It needs a re-spray every now and again so my 15ml bottle really isn't going to last long! I feel like I've been trying to find this scent for years, subconsciously. Love it. I literally watched every review of this one then I got myself a full bottle with some huge expectations on it but it dissapoints me big time. This smells like a generic Elizabeth Arden Green Tea which is fragrance I don't like. This has been raved by youtubers as Jean Claude Ellena's masterpiece but to my nose its so boring. Better sample it first before getting a full bottle. Your olfactory senses is the true barometer not the senses of others. 
Tho I'm not closing my doors on this one, hopefully I will like this in the future but right now this is a complete dud. If you love Elizabeth Arden Green Tea this would be a great addition to your collection. If you hate that fragrance stay away from this. 
6/10 This was recommended by a trusted sales women at Nordstrom. I asked her for a summer scent that was present and long lasting. I went for 🏋🏽♀️ and 🏊🏽♀️... took a shower 🚿lotioned 🧴 up & hit my self about 4 times w/ this at 1:45.... it is a lovely 🍊 🥭 opening and is sharp & PRESENT ! That’s what I like about it. But, what I love about it, is it stayed present until I showered 🧼 again 10:30pm... so yeah I’m Loving this and will be wearing this for a while this summer ☺️. I also got a bottle of H24 at the same tine and I haven’t even opened it yet because I like this and want to wear it again tomorrow. A rarity for me...I have to say for an EDT and a lower price point than the ToM Ford’s I own, I might be 👋🏽 to that house 🏠. I mean TF has many great 👍🏾 frags! I own about 5 or 6 in
My collection but they don’t last like this right here! The Soleiel Blanc EDT and EDP lasts & Are the best of the summer frags IMO and of course TV is great for winter ❄️ but TV is not a Beach 🏖 summer frag. I wanted to try the new soleil Brulant but I’m tired of dropping 350 for a perfume with f’n amazing openings then a becomes a skin scent by hour 2-3 (original Private Blend costta Azzura, fucking fabulous, Tuscan leather ) so I went with this and I am not even disappointed. I mean I literally was able to smell this on me for a good 7 to 8 hours. The grapefruit and mango settle down to a nice fresh dry down that evolves to a deep and heavy layer of musk and mango w/ a hint of grapefruit but then the tomatoe comes in there right behind it ever so lightly... this is good stuff for the price point and to be an EDT it’s 🔥! the scent is a bit too bitter to my taste ""For the Gardeners""
Un Jardin Sur La Nil is a masterclass in how to do a fruity aromatic. The initial blast of zesty citrus-mango-tomato plant is a summer garden in a bottle. I absolutely love, love, love wearing this when it gets really hot and humid in the summer and I need something to cut through that languid yucky muggy muckiness. The tomato plant note is realistic and makes me feel nostalgic for helping my parents in our garden as a child. I feel like this scent will appeal to those who have experience with gardening and are outdoorsy nature types. The longevity is poor and sillage nonexistent. You just have to enjoy those initial 20 minutes so much that it makes it worth it. Good God this is a bracing freshie! I have never come across a scent with such a strong, agressive and astringent opening until I got this, and thats no bad thing.
I initially wanted to purchase Un Jardin Sur Le Toit when looking for a scent which accurately replicated the scent of freshly cut grass, but when I sampled it, as nice as it is, it just didnt have enough greenness in it for my liking, I've on and off sampled Un Jardin En Mediterranee and liked it, but when I read the notes for this, I was really lured in; mango, grapefruit, lotus, tomato AND incense? I wondered how a summer freshie with incense would work, I never really felt like incense was a light and airy note, but I was happy to be proven wrong.
From smelling the sprayer, it smelt fresh and like the usual oceanic, citrussy summer scents I normally go for, but upon spraying it I thought my nose was going to explode; sharp, fresh, bracing citrusses and cold arctic air, I was half asleep but upon aplication I felt pretty damn perked up! who needs coffee when this exists?! (Ok, I still need coffee, keeps my inner Gilmore Girl happy) 
After 10 minutes the harshness from the opening settles down and a very natural grapefruit emerges with some mango, but the mango note doesnt smell synthetic or juvenile nor does it dominate the crisp citrusses, it adds some extra depth and a more ""fleshy"" feel with tomato and lotus adding some aquatic greenness and making this scent feel fresh, the best thing with this one is, throughout wear it never loses its freshness or becomes ""BO"" like (Yes The Body Shop, I'm looking at your Pink Grapefruit EdT...) in the later stages of the drydown, bulbrush peaks out and I'm left with a slightly musky aquatic/herbal skinscent.
Longevity is very good for a citrus scent, 7 hours of wear from 4 spritzes with a light silage, its fresh, its invigorating, I'd say its perfect for casual and formal wear and very office friendly and I cannot wait to wear it during the summer months, I'll be repurchasing a 100ml bottle in the future, thats for sure! The opening of mango is strong, and grapefruit is apparent. What I've loved about this is how complex it is, there's a lot of fresh and exciting notes in there to discover, but also it lasts longer than most citrus fresh perfumes do....it must be the incense or musk... not that these are at all noticeable, but not sure what else is giving it that longevity. One of my faves. Fresh and mood uplifting fragrance. But it lasts very short. It is an easy , safe and simple choice for summer days. That's all A lovely spring, early summer scent. This is very green, fresh, and uplifting. 
It reminds me of the day we took a boat to the Aswan Botanical Garden on an island on the Nile. With the desert all around us, it was a perfect oasis for an afternoon break. When I smelled Un Jardin Sur Le Nil, I was instantly transported back to that garden, that day in the spring of 2008. And when a fragrance can do that, the job is accomplished in my book. Unique summer scent. First, I regret about it, but by the time, it becomes absolutely one of the favorite. Not just floral, but weirdly green. I think it is tomato leaf and this note makes it different. So good for really hot weathers. 
8/10 Wow.
That is really off-putting to my nose.
I love the jardin collection I think they are amazing but this one is the first one I don’t like.
Smells so chemical to me like a really pure alcool shot of something or a bugs spray..
I think I will wash my wrist. A mix between green, citrus, and very very slightly aquatic. 
Would have hoped for this fragrance to develop into something more than that, because that could've possibly made it a perfect scent, but now it unfortunately stays like the opening. Which is nice. But would've liked some development. 
Smells like a fancy garden party, with lime and lemon based cocktails and good looking people laughing at the lightness of life. In a good way. Would wear this on a party like that. The best way I can describe this scent is that it smells like the summer breeze. Cooling, refreshing and invigorating. At the first whiff, you can easily detect the tartness of green mango, then a slight hint of sweetness from the carrot and lotus. Finally, it leaves a lingering trail of spicy incense note.
I love how unique and sophisticated this fragrance is, but its performance is rather quite disappointing as it only last for 2 to 3 hours on my skin. On the bright side, the perfume is discreet and subtle, making it a perfect fragrance for the workplace or warm environment. Seems like the opening somewhat resembles Moschino Funny, but in a subtle way, which immediately changes into fresh-cut mangoes. Then wait for the dry down -- which comes at peak best -- but like a chameleon somehow changing notes every time I smell it on my skin, albeit always heavenly. Un Jardin Sur Le Nil.. fruity like riping mango and citrus but very soft, elegant, and complex. I wear Sur Le Toit, Monsieur Li, and Sur Le Nil. Sur Le Nil is the most elegant and delicate. very complex. Like a very elegant and artistic person, but with kind and warm smile. The middle and base notes is the best. 
I imagine them as:
Sur Le Toit: Cheerful summer, energic. Youthful and Loud
Sur Le Nil: Elegant summer, soft, calm, warm and kind. High class and Elegant
Monsieur Li: Calm Spring, soft and elegant, gentle and warm. Mature and Warm
I am male, wore Sur Le Nil about a year, I live in tropical country with hot and humid weather.. and I can say this perfume performs really well.. At first spray you will get citrusy and sour smell, I don't quite like the opening though.. But after maybe an hour, it turns out really soft. Very delicate and complex smell, very nice smell. I can't even tell what notes it is, but the middle and base notes it smells like fruit riping,but very soft. You can wear this to a party or formal and informal events, or even at home or travelling. Not a fit choice for office, except you wear it like an hour before you get to the office, because the opening is a bit strong. -Opens with nice, clean mango notes
-Fresh and light mango scent.
-Clean, airy vibes.
-Reminds me of a summer day in the meadow.
-Longevity: Low (2 hours)
-Projection: Low (next to none)
-While I wouldn't mind receiving a bottle of this, I wouldn't purchase it for myself...fragrances from Hermes are EDT concentration at best...hence, not worth the price tag.
-Not fbw. (-) citrus sweet opening. green. the citrus is steady throughout the day and it grew on me. felt some aquatic notes. I definitely need to test this again since it's the winter right now, but the opening is extremely sharp and sour and it won't go away. It smells exactly like lemon Windex right now. I left a review for UJSLN 11 years ago and since then it became my signature scent. I have had Un jardin sur le toit and Un jardin en Méditerranée which I love just as well but this somehow just clicked with me with its green tropical and fruity notes. This I wore in the spring but I would do so occasionally in the winter too for a mood uplift. 
It is very longlasting for an EDT (it behaves more like an extrait de parfum); it lasts over 24 hours on skin and a few days on hair and clothes. It is probably the longest lasting perfume I've had. 
Classic Hermès, intemporal, romantic! Une merveille ! When I first Spray it, I smell 
grapefruit, tomato and a hint of green, no, almost yellow mango, but dominantly grapefruit and tomato
Then I start smelling the lotus and other and the other florals with a hint of carrot? 
What stays on my skin after a while of wearing it is grapefruit, tomato, florals and a tiny bit of incense. I do not smell the cinnamon which is very sad to me, because I love the smell of cinnamon a lot! A watery, bitter mess on my skin. The same happens with Terre d'Hermes. If you're unfamiliar with and/or not vibing with grapefruit notes, don't blind buy. Has a very tart opening but a wonderful highly elegant dry down. I have not found anything else that comes close without being sweet or precious. Beautiful. Fresh, light and fragrant.
This is definitely not a screamer, but more of a close skin scent. 
It's like being transported to a fragrant garden in the summer, fruity and floral, but not overly so. Just the tiniest bit of sweetness.
This is a scent to enjoy on your own, relaxing in the shade on a warm day, or enjoying a morning walk perhaps.
Another outstanding fragrance from this house. This is a really lovely spring/summer scent. The opening is quite vegetal and citrusy- I can really pick up on the grapefruit, tomato and mango. There's a freshness to it with a hint of spice that's quite appealing.
It settles into a delicious floral, green, aquatic, almost musky vibe while still retaining its crisp freshness. 
Longevity is moderate, about 5-6 hours with the first hour having some projection. After that it becomes more of a skin scent. 
The scent itself is an 8.5/10 for me. Very weak sillage on me, mostly a skin scent after not too long. In the bottle, smells like a mix of citrus and mangoes, but on me it smells very soapy, some sort of citrusy bubbly soap. Drydown was alright. As I'm going through my bottle, I'm starting to like it more and more for the warm spring and summer days where you just want something light and fresh. I recommended this to someone recently, realized I had never reviewed it, and decided to pull out what’s left of my sample vial and wear it today. 
I forgot how much I like this for summer! I think I’ve been prejudiced against it because it has a noticeable lotus note, and I’ve always had it in my head that I don’t care for lotus. But I like it here!
The citrus and mango don’t last more than a minute or two for me after the first spray, but the drydown is such a stunning, green/aquatic floral - It just perfectly, perfectly evokes a riverside garden. I feel like I need to find a bottle of this before summer comes back around again. So I was never a big fan of perfumes, mainly because I found them to be too strong (flashback to my early teens till univerity years). When I finally found out more about perfumes and what types they have and the variety ofc, I finally understood that I just haven't found my signature or well my scent. I was on a hunt for years after I bought my first perfume (lanvin eclat de fleurs). Something was missing though with that perfume, having used it for two years now I realised I was over that too girly smells and generic ones as well ( for reference i am 23). So I needed something different and unique- that is it. Something that would not smell like any other perfumes on the market right now- but that is too hard to find I thought, until I found this gem. This is the one, this is the unique, not smelling like that generic fruity, sweet teenager or rose type of in your face ( arrogant ) perfume. This here gives you a feeling that you are indeed walking near or in a garden, be it the Nile. From the first sniff I knew that this is a game changer. After spraying it on my skin I was surprised because seemingly it should have a tomato smell, yet i just got fresh veggies and that is it, but after letting it sit on my skin for a while, I knew that this gives your more than vegetable freshness. It has citrus it has even a very subtle note of sweetness to it- maybe the mango, but it is not a ripe one, more like... pear?. Yet, I still have not bought it because the other sur le toit stole my heart... but this one is still dear to me and I will defnitely add it to my ultimate signature collection once I can afford all my favourite Hermes scents. (Hermes house knows how to come up with amazing fragrances and that is for sure!!! Also I love Hermes' Eau de Rhubarbe Écarlate) Yaah the price point is something to consider when you want to have this in your collection, but i do believe it is worth the money. 
The longevity of this perfume is actually very good- i was expecting maybe a 2-3 hours or something, but on me it lasted for 4-5h, even 6. Guess it could depend on the skin chemistry as well but I do think it can last longer than toilettes do. 
I would recommend this gem to those who are tired of those generic perfumes that everyone smells like... to be honest i was on the look to find something fresh like the Chanel chance eau fraiche, it being a unisex fragrance as well then I think I hit the jackpot with this one as this one is targeted for both women and male ( like literally I could not gender categorize this, it just smells like a fragrance nothing too feminine or masculine). This is more than just a fresh smell. really give it a try and you will love it yourself and if you don't then I think you would be more for the sweet and mysterious scents rather than this one. I would go on with my review but i think it is already a bit too long. for the final thought-- this is defnitely a smell that would please any nose, because it isn't one of those in your face perfumes or too strong... it is just there on your skin, beautifully smelling. This was a blind buy, because I read the story about this fragrance in Chandler Burr's book and I just had to try it. I find it absolutely stunning, one of the best summer scents there is. Fresh and elegant in the same time and for a citrus-based fragrance, it has a decent lasting power. Silage is very close to skin. Buy it for the summer, you won't be sorry I understand why there are mixed reviews for this. I for one absolutely love it. I have been wearing it the past week and i am not getting tired of it. 
Its no complement monster for sure but i have been told i smell rich which is a decent compliment i guess. 
All in all this gets an 8,5 from me and thats a high rating! This is a confusing fragrance. As it starts to dry, I smell a tomato-y, vegetable + grassy scent. The sweet floral notes that are trying to keep up (considering there is tomato in this, perhaps they're trying to ketchup?). 
There are too many clashing notes for me to truly like this. This smells like a vegetable garden competing with a flower garden. It's certainly unique and unexpected. It's also fresh - again, in an unexpected way - and entirely ""unisex"". My personal preference would lean masculine.
Silage is very soft (I did use a splash bottle, but I applied along my forearm, elbows, and neck), Longevity is moderate. This doesn't give me a headache or sinus issues due to scent sensitivity. This is fresh, wet cut grass with hints of grapefruit and tomato. My husband smells bug spray, and my teen and tween smell their grandmother's house. All that said, this is a very complex and unisex fragrance. Just not one I'm inclined to spray on my body. It doesn't make me feel pretty, confident, or sexy. So, in that regard, it doesn't make the cut. Sillage and lasting power are quite nice for an EDT. Green mango, grapefruit, floral.
A good summer scent. The unmistakable 
Hermes quality stamp is there. 7/10
A very interesting and totally unique scent, but lacks any discernable mango for me. The grapefruit citrus punch is perfect for a hot summery day when you want something clean without smelling like floor cleaner (looking at you D&G Light Blue). I get a wonderful grapefruit scent taking center stage with a vegetal background (tomato, carrot). After the grapefruit opening dies down you smell more of the floral lotus. I do not get any incense, musk, iris or cinnamon, they must be blended in a very subtle and balanced way to provide heft without drowning out the top notes. I must say though, the grapefruit is a little *too* strong for me as I am generally averse to citrus-heavy scents and my nose tends to get overwhelmed when they are the focus. I wish I could smell more of the vegetal notes and lotus notes! Hands down the best designer fragrance I’ve tried for summer. Going to have to try the rest of the line for sure. 
Don’t let the tomato or bulrush notes scare you off. They’re perfect players supporting the mango. The fragrance opens bright but airy and slightly wet. It’s as if you’re smelling fresh air in the most beautiful divine tropical garden with the smell of mango drifting in. This is absolutely amazing. I’m a little confused on projection issues some are having. On my skin the siliage is pretty big even though the projection is moderate. There’s a definitive scent trail that comes from this. And it lasts fairly well for me too.
If I could only have one designer fragrance from those I’ve tried thus far; this would be it. Love it!! 
When You spray it you get grapefruit and green mango. After 10 minutes the lotus and the rest of the notes appear! Very aquatic and fresh. The lotus here gave it a very beautiful touch. It is so unique I have never tried something similar. So in conclusion after 15/30 minutes you have a cool refreshing ( tomato leaves, green mango, grapefruit, lotus and aquatic notes). Like you’re sitting next to a pond or as the name of the perfume says NILE. Great for spring and hot summer days!
Longevity: 8/10
Sillage: 7/10 If 'cartier déclaration pour homme eau fraiche' (i know 'fraiche' already is among us)existed, this would be it.
Nice one. One of my oldest perfume-loves. I almost got this, right when it was launched, but something else showed up, and later Saharienne took the place of the ultra-refreshing summer perfume... 
But now I finally bought Sur Le Nil from a friend whose wife does not like how it smells on his skin. Since this wife happens to be my friend U., the almighty perfume guru in our circles, there is really no arguing about that :-D
Sur le Nil is wonderful - a tart, green, sweet, uplifting, elegant haze. Not a single note comes out to greet me, but it makes me oh so very happy. 
It is not long-lasting at all, I get out some 3 hours out of it, and it also gets soft quite fast. Far better in hot weather. 
PS: If you love this and you like rose and berry, then you might want to try In Love Again (especially the vintage version) - also by Ellena. They are very similar to me. Very fresh, airy, a hint of citrus and juicy green like cucumber peel in the opening, I can totally get the tomato leaf note from this one, the rest of the notes are very subtle. I do get a bit of the Iris in far dry down, other than that there isn't much floral to my nose, so most men can rock this juice just fine. 
This has the same vibe as the Musc Imperial from Atelier Cologne, they do not smell the same but are in the same 'genre' and gave me the same impression. This fragrance is quite gentle so it isn't going to be offensive to overspray, it smells so good I'm always tempted to douse myself with 10 to 15 sprays of this. 
Decent longevity, moderate projection and sillage. The musk usually made my nose anosmic, this one is no exception. Safe blind buy for sure. Damn this is good!!! Excellent value for high quality. Perfect summer fragrance. 9/10
Sprayed at 5:30 for a dinner out, returned home at 8pm and couldn’t even smell it as a skin scent. Disappointing performance, needs more testing.
Appears to have 3 hour longevity but the scent is beautiful. I agree with you @Imwimsatt this fragrance is reformulated! Today I’m bought a new bottle and it 20% different from my old bottle I used. Current batch of ‘Sur Le Nil’ seem more sweet than the previous one, green mango dominant overall and now it a bit similarly to ‘Sur Le Toit’ sweetness. I’m not sure if Hermés trying to reformulate this or it batch variation. The current version is less unique and more pleasant for mass market. Sadly I love the way it smell unique like chili stalk in the old formular. Anyway I still like this line.
Old formula: Cattail dominant over the green mango make it feeling like fresh chili stalk, watery and green grass, less sweet and unique from other Jardins line. 
New formula: Green mango upfront, cattail behind, much much more sweet and become something like ‘Sur Le Toit’ fruity sweetness, not so unique as before. Younger people will prefer current formula I think, but it loses it own character that people who love it remember. I was curious about this after reading Chandler Burr's ""The Perfect Scent"" where he documents the development process of Un Jardin Sur Le Nil by Jean-Claude Ellena for Hermes. When I first smelled the scent I already had visions of Egypt, green mangoes and sunlight reflecting off the Nile as described in the book. 
I consider this to be a completely unisex fragrance. It has an almost bitter green opening and then mellows to a more balanced blend of green, florals and citrus with a slightly earthy, white musk undertone. 
For me this is an easy-to-wear warm weather scent that is distinctive yet safe for work. It's one of the few fragrances I own that feels right on a hot dry day or during a warm spring rain. Sillage is light to medium but longevity isn't great for me - maybe 4 hours. Great blend of citrus/green/fresh spicy/fruity/tropical. I enjoyed it, but became a little headache-inducing and carrot/tomato heavy. Based on this I swapped it away. Since then I was able to try Entre Nous by Galimard and THIS is Sur Le Nil Sans tomato leaf and carrot!!!!!! Do not make the mistake of looking at the notes before you try it on for yourself. 
Mango, tomatoes, carrots.. smh..
They might not be the best combination in the salad you have at a sunday brunch on a summer day.. But this perfume is the Perfect thing to wear to that sunday brunch. 
It is very well composed. Well blended and all the notes come together beautifully. 
Don't be afraid of the unique choice of notes. They are essential ingredients to this magic potion. This is a freshly peeled unripened mango with green garden leaves shaken in a cool mister bottle. It’s airy and fresh, light and mildly sweet, very green. Uplifting and perfect for a super hot day. Not really my vibe but it’s a nice scent. Whoa this is much sweeter having more mango than I remember. I used to love this one. This also used to have carrots in it. Was this reformulated? A green mango that is pure tartaric acid, a grapefruit that is pure ascorbic acid, dappled in greens singing high in the sun - didn’t ancient Egyptians believe fragrances to be the sweat of Sun-God Ra?- baskets of the prettiest lotus flowers (note which usually turns into calone mouthwash on my skin, not here) far-away incense and light aromatic reservoir from calamus... and then perfume-god Nefertum heals the Sun from disappearing with vitamin C. 
The middle stage is truly glorious, aquatic but not exceedingly, a little creek streaming lotus flowers and green mangoes dazzled by streaks of sunlight gushing through the reeds. This scent is simply delicious. It’s fresh, clean, elegant, you can detect the Hermes touch in it. I love to use it during spring or summer - not sure if someone could pull it off during winter - Anyway... whenever I spray it, it immediately takes me to a garden with delicious herbs and citrusy plants. It puts me in a good mood, really. I don’t have words to describe how much I love this perfume. Not to mention the bottle: that beautiful green color in degradé. This has to be one of the best unisex fragrances ever, and I'm not just saying that because it's the only fragrance my husband and I share. Okay, the sharing thing is a large part of the reason I'm saying it's so great.
In warm weather, the vegetal notes really stand out in me, and I smell like I've been wrestling with a tomato plant, while being pelted with grapefruit segments. As much as I love the scent of tomato plants, it really is not good. It was fabulous on my husband. Fresh and green and gorgeous. It is very citrusy, as it was on me, but on him, there was not even a hint of mango.
Skin chemistry is weird. Anyway...
In cooler weather, the fruit, spice and incense stands out on me, and I just love it. On my husband, the cattail (bullrushes) note is a lot more prevalent, and it's very spicy and musky. 
It's really a beautifully blended creation. On me, the sillage is strong, and the scent lasts all day. On my husband, the sillage is moderate, but again, the fragrance lasts for hours. Citric and fruity, a delicate and subtle composition with a very natural quality. The scent is the vivid sensation of tropical summer on a Caribbean island. Longevity and sillage moderate . A wonderful scent! I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. I've owned it for two years now. I started off with a sample, and decided to spring for a full bottle.
I get a nice green semi aquatic vibe from UJSN. The mango is front and center, and its sweetness is enhanced by the carrot. I also smell papyrus or cattails (bulrushes) giving it the green effect. I do smell some tomato leaf, but it isn't strong and surprisingly it doesn't turn me off like it has in other fragrances. There are floral notes that don't smell ""flowery"" to my nose. Some incense and rock rose anchor the whole creation. 
I think this fragrance is 100% unisex.. It sits on the line. I asked coworkers what they thought, and it was basically 50/50. It's safe for the office and a refreshing spring /summer scent. 
Sillage is decent, as is longevity. This is no performance monster, but it isn't weak either. 
I'm a fan of Hermès, and the Jardin line in particular, and even more so of the nose : Jean-Claude Ellena. This, along with Un Jardin en Méditerranée, are my favorites from the Jardin line. Citrus to create a crisp, fresh feeling, very cool. Lotus with incense like scent in an old temple, years precipitation, quiet, distant.
I think The Prince of Egypt, the baby Moses floated all the way to the palace from the Nile scene At first, Jardin Sur Le Nil smells like a salad from shredded carrots and oranges that my mum used to make me when I was a kid. Very crisp, uplifting and with the right amount of lush sweetness. After that it goes into a green mango scent, realistic, not like some cheaper and usually very sweet wannabe mango scent.
Later on, some of the base notes develop. Mainly incense and labdanum, but don't let that fool you, no heaviness here, still quite crisp. Overall I must say, that the drydown has a very ""classic perfumery"" feel to me. I don't know if this has been reformulated, but even if so, it still retained the ""beginning of the century vibe"", meaning it's not any fleeting fresh modern composition, but a very classy Jean-Claude Ellena manuscript.
Together with the Aqua Allegoria line from Guerlain, I consider Les Jardines from Hermès as a real treasure in the perfume world. My hearts skips a beat when I smell those sparkly and uplifting compositions. So if you're a fan of crisp, not very sweet and heavy suffocating perfumes, almost each one from these lines could be a right choice. If you are into crisp perfumes, this is a very nice EdT for the summer. I bought a mini for my partner who found it nice but too crisp for his taste, so I'm trying this on a warm spring day (18ºC). On my skin, it opens as an unapologetic grapefruit, very bitter and realistic. After a couple of minutes, though, it merges with something that smells like unripe mangoes and tomato leaves. Maybe there's something else there, because it sweetens a bit too, but I can't identify what it is. Nonetheless, it stays super crisp and fresh for the whole duration of the experience (so far, 5h). The scent is very linear on my skin, and the projection is strong enough even after 5 h to catch a whiff every now and then.
Even though I'm not a big citrus fan, I can see myself reaching for this when the temperatures go higher than 30ºC. It's truly refreshing and can be used by men or women alike, as it's so green it becomes genderless.
7/10 This is fresh Green mango and carrots and lush spring on my Sister in law, on my shin all I get is Geranium. Fresh but so not what I cot on Her skin. I remember recoiling when I first smelled this in about 2009. I'd read about its famous green mango opening but was not prepared for it when I finally got to test it. It reminded me of nothing I'd ever smelled before. I didn't hate it but didn't think I could pull it off. I'd been wearing perfume all my adult life, good perfume too, but had never smelled anything so abstract and, as it seemed then, strange and unpredictable. I could not smell any of the individual notes and if asked would have said 'çitrusy, clean, strong but floaty, weird, expensive'.
After several years of testing Nil occasionally when I travelled (my city had no Hermes outlet then) I finally bought a bottle. By then I had smelled a lot of niche perfume and Nil did not seem nearly so distinctive. In fact, I began to find the development a bit linear and dull. To make matters worse, I once smelled it on a female executive (Nil is very easy to identify) of the sort who hires the best architects and interior decorators, keeps up with the trends, buys books by the metre and wears Hermes because it's expensive.
Recently I've gone back to Nil. The opening still startles me, but I appreciate that the perfumer had to land the perfume somewhere after that initial outburst of green mango and grapefruit. I've been wearing it again in these late summer days and whereas the drydown once seemed dull, now I find it both calming and refreshing. Nil lingers all day on me. It harmonises with summer cotton and linen shirts, either at work or on weekends. 
Nil not so hard to find now and the FOMO gang has long since moved on from it. Like its companion, Sarah Jessica Parker's Lovely (anyone who has read Chandler Burr's book knows what I mean), Nil has been around long enough to have entered a new phase; I notice from the reviews here that people are starting to get nostalgic for the days when their mothers wore it. 
My executive friend is probably wearing Santal 33 now. Waw! Blind buy from outstanding reviews. The book also arrived and I can't wait to start it. I also can't wait for summer to arrive so that I can try this jewel in the conditions that it was created for. Love at first smell. The quality of ingredients is outstanding. Nothing about it smells synthetic. So fresh! You can see the garden around you as you're wearing it. Testing a tester version in 2018: Mouth watering flowered mango. The aroma leaves a foot and a half inside the female vibe, surpassing the streaks of the unisex. Comfortable and easy to please. Strong projection of 2 meters for 2 hours. Re-experiencing a new sample (from a normal frag) in 2019: I detect a big difference - I feel the mango much greener, the floral content is much less impactful and an earthy chord under that floral-fruity chord. The potency is also much lower - weak. But the scent now pleases me more, is more balanced. An explosion of summery loveliness; green mangoes, florals, breezy and chic. Quite an abstract composition with a bit of complexity, part synthetic and part as natural as sliced watermelon. The dry-down on my skin veers more towards musk than woods, which is a plus for warm-weather scents. In fact, it blooms quietly in hot weather, with close sillage and admirable persistence for something that seems so brittle. It's similar in vibe to some of the other Les Jardin perfumes, especially Sur Le Toit, but is still utterly unique. A pleasure to wear in summer, and sometimes a burst of joy in the dead of winter.
4/5 Tomato! Yes, thanks to Demeter Fragrance Library, I totally get the tomato. But I also totally get cucumber and LOTS of celery. Commodity's Book and Maison Louis Marie No. 04 Bois de Balincourt both have this same note, whatever it is, but to me it's very peppery celery.
I love that note in all of those scents (Tomato, Book and No. 04), but not in this one. For me, the pepper was overwhelming and the celery far too bitter. It's very unique, but I'd go with one of those others if I was looking for a vegetal scent. And don't be shy - - it's not like you'll smell like a produce bin, but... kind of! My favorite from the Un Jardin line. Fully unisex, a very creative blend of vegetable-earthy notes (dont expect to be able to pick out the carrot and tomato, it's just an overall green mist) with a triumphing note of grapefruit all throughout.
The sillage is the downside, it sits close to the skin and lasts half an evening long. That said, the atomizer chosen by Hermés is stellar and the weak sillage can be compensated by a generous application.
Appropriate for all seasons.
Astral Weeks, performed by Van Morrison One of the most interesting and harmonious perfumes ever created. Gentle, light-green freshness. Clean and airy yet unusual. Suitable for men and women equally. This is one of the perfumes that I would enjoy smelling at every moment, it's fresh, aquatic, green, it feels like a crystalline lake covered with tangerines floating next to water lilies at sunset.
I smell some tomato, yes, but something like a breeze that brings the wind, is so well mixed that you feel an exquisite continuity between the notes, with a more than striking name, an impeccable presentation, and the surprise of such a bright smell, make this perfume one of my favorites. Superb summer joy in bottle
Flippant without being facile unexpected depth
9.5/10 My signature. This smells clean but not like any other. I think this scent is a masterpiece from JCE. I wish the longevity and sillage were much more but I cannot stop wearing that. If you wanna looking for sth different, clean and hot&rainy day friendly scent, this is just for you. This beautiful fragrance begins with the smell of green mango and a surprising note between carrot stem and tomato. In the heart, the calame, with green and grassy accents, marries the lotus of the Nile, with a pink smell reminiscent of hyacinth and peony. The bottom becomes more woody, covered with essences of sycamore and incense. The whole is fruity-green-woody. After the success of ""A garden in the Mediterranean"", Hermes invites travel lovers to discover the beauty of Egypt on the banks of the Nile. In this garden, kilometers of postcard landscapes, the breath of the wind has sacred lotus aromas, dotted with sycamores and green mangos. A new, fresh, sunny and promising essence that men and women can share for the greatest pleasure of the senses. A veggie/green citrus scent. Unusual, intriguing, maybe too out of my comfort zone.
The projection starts strong, then after 2-3 hours it's closer to skin, still sniffable, but fainter and fainter. Maybe 3 hours of good performance. It seems I could still catch some green notes during the day when my skin was warmer, but it was really random, I didn't smell anything most of the time. 
I test it on my cleavage at the perfume store. My mom didn't like it at first, it was too odd and strong to her, I personally found it interesting and different. She thought it was better after 2 hours when it was softer. We were in a heatwave and it seems like it was the right moment to wear it. When I got home, I put back my comfy clothes and I smelled more the perfume that I wore the day before (Lolita Lempicka), with a bit of greenth in the background. The longevity didn't impress me.
I don't hate Un Jardin Sur Le Nil, I think it could be agreeable at the right timing, I love the idea, I found it less screechy than Un Jardin Sur La Lagune, I wish I got a sample to test it more, but I don't think it lasts and that I love it enough to buy it. I might retry it one day. It's weird in a good way for me. I think Hermes has the formula for great-performing, fresh scents, on lockdown.
For a tart, slightly bitter herbal fresh scent, this one has excellent performance. I don't understand how Hermes' freshies can last well and more expensive fresh scents (looking at you, Tom Ford) are pathetic in their performance.
My only issue with this one is that I don't actually like the scent itself. It's a bit linear and typical for me. I've been more impressed with others from this line. But if this is your vibe, this lasts well on hot, sweaty skin, working in the garden and washing up afterwards, for currently around 6 hours. That's killer performance. It's not loud at this point, but it's definitely still there. I've added this one to my wishlist. Though not listed, I think I can sense some leather in it as well. Good for daytime/office wear, but by no means tame. Definitely an autumn scent for me and definitely a scent for confident women. Longevity about 4-5 hours. Reminds me of Balenciaga B. Skin. A few hours after spraying I think I can sense vegetables and I'm not yet sure how I feel about that. This was interesting and not how I imagined it, purely off the note description. It's my mom's signature scent so I might have emotions and memories attached to it, but I like it. It's not a 'love' (but then again, no Hermes has done that for me so far because they tend to be way too weak for my tastes) but it's definitely a 'like'.
It's green, refreshing, clean and citrusy - but in a different way than most 'citrus' perfumes. It has an inscrutable quality to it, and I had trouble picking out individual notes. It was simply 'green and citrusy but different' to my nose. 
Longevity and projection are both moderate, and it's easily a unisex perfume. It doesn't in any way conjure up images of Egypt or the Nile, though! This was quite a let-down for me. From something this expensive, you would expect something more than a good summer fragrance. I wanted this to be a bit exotic, interesting, different. Yet, that dind't happen. From the first time i opened the bottle i knew i allready smelled this somewhere. I realised it reminded me of a summer by the pool when my granny was using some sort of cheap facial spray (by oriflame, i think). The spray smelled exactly like this. And probably lasted longer.
It opens with juicy grapefruit, lotus and than... it's gone before i can find the other notes. 
It's a nice thing to spray over yourself in hot days, when you don't really want to use a fragrance. But body sprays by adidas are so much cheaper and do the job just as well.
5/10 It doesn't smell as exotic to me as the notes would suggest. I was hoping to make out the carrot, etc., but it's just a blur of green and earthy notes, with a tiny bit of spice. SOTD...I must say the Performance is Fantastic...got 7/8 hrs Longevity...great sillage,projection 3/4 hrs. This is a really beautiful green natural scent of citrus mixed with a warm & soft musky mango, & with a hint of lively spiciness. 
It's light like a white floral fragrance & fresh like an aquatic one. It's also cozy, comfortable, inoffensive, & light.
However, like the rest of the eau de colognes from Hermes, this has an utterly embarrassing performance, despite being an EDT. It's a skin scent with absolutely no sillage & the longevity is barely 3-4 hours.
I really like it but it feels like a rip off at $75/100ml. I'd recommend trying Bvlgari's Mon Jasmin Noir L'Eau Exquise, as people voted that they are similar & it's a more economical, & logical, choice. I expected to smell like a lotus garden wearing this,(and I do not) so it is a bit of a letdown. I do not think I love this perfume but at the same time I cannot stop putting it on. The scent is so fresh and mysterious, perfect for summer. A very fresh, ""garden like"" scent, a bit more intense than un jardin so I would wear this at night or colder weather. Not my cup of tea personally but it's a very non offence scent so it would be great for an office job or customer service. Has a slightly tropical vibe to it so the fruit notes make sense but I wouldn't put them as top notes more middle or base. The citrus is noticeable though I concur with positive reviews below. It is lovely. Pity it has so little staying power. I realize it is an EDT, but still.. This opens with what might be the most photorealistic grapefruit I've ever encountered in a fragrance. Eating grapefruit on a shore of a vast lake (or river), it's lovely. Citric, aquatic, just a little vegetal... but barely lasts 3 hours, and it's a skin scent. Yes, it's an eau de toilette, but I'm glad I redeemed a Sephora reward for this because I'd never pay full Hermes price for something this fleeting. I've tester this one today, but to me it smells like after sun. I like it, but won't buy it.... I love this vanilla dry-down. But there is no vanilla in the composition so where do I get this? This creation from Hermes is just amazing. Plain and simple. It is incredibly unique. It is the perfect juxtaposition of vibrant freshness and light juiciness. It is fresh in a green sense, not necessarily a citrus way, because the carrot and tomato leaf somehow add an interesting vegetable note to the grapefruit and mango. It is extremely sophisticated, which one would expect nothing less from Hermes. Lasting power is excellent for a fresh scent, this lasts all day on me, and in the evening, you're left with this beautiful juicy mango scent that lingers and catching whiffs of it is so invigorating and uplifting. It is fresh but not in a D&G Light Blue way, and its fruity, but not in an Escada way. The vegetation coupled with the fruits and the florals is what gives this scent such a sophisticated edge. This fragrance has been blended to perfection and is such a special and interesting scent. I feel like when I wear this, people who walk by will definitely wonder what it is. It is a masterpiece. Creations of Jean Claude Ellena never fail to impress me and Un Jardin Sur Nil isn't an exception. Un Jardin starts off with very unique tomato leaf (most people get mango which i unfortunately don't) and lemon note on top. As it starts to dry down lotus note (similiar to Nautica Voyage) joins the party making the combination soothing and calming. This beautiful amalgamation of notes is backed by Ellena's signature Iso-E super note giving it an earthy (not dirty) vibe. 
Imagine yourself walking in the fields of fruits and vegetables on a cloudy day, you kneel down, pick up the soil and rub it in your hands; thinking how beautiful is nature. This is how i picture this fragrance.
Longevity is surprisingly good with moderate projection. Definitely well suited for Spring and Summer with office being the perfect setting. People who like fresh slightly unique fragrance; i say they must try this. For me at least this full bottle worthy. MY ALL TIME FAVORITE***
I can smell it from miles.Unique combination of citrus, vegetables under-notes, with a little touch of fresh spices can blow your mind.
you will never think perfume can combine so much feelings and notes.It will be rough with you from the very beginning , but as soon as Nil will blend into your skin it will open all the doors... Green, watery and peaceful. 
“Sur Le Nil” doesn’t reminds me any Egyptian or Nile river, I can’t get so much lotus or incense from it, “Sur Le Nil” to me is a fresh watery, green and feeling like smell from green chilli flower stalk(Not in a bad way). It’s natural, safe scent and easy to wear. 
Scent: 7.5/10 (Not a groundbreaking, just simply Zen-like) 
Projection: 7/10 (Skin scent from opening to dry down)
Longevity: 7/10 (About 4-6 hours mostly) 
I’m a fan boy of “Jardin” line.. and I have to say I don’t love with “Sur Le Nil” but I won’t hate it. It a kind of easy fragrance in a easy day, so I can wear it even I don’t want to wear perfume, and I can wear it even in a bad mood because it so chill , so transparent, clean and fresh yet still niche quality (super naturaly). 
You might disagree with me because of it is the most successful in a “Jardin” line, and the opinion can be different by perspectives. This is one of the very best Hermes creations. As a summer scent it's perfection in a bottle. Please tell me it has not been reformulated. I still have a bottle of the original and I'm treasuring it. So juicy and fresh, I could drink this stuff. For me, the opening is mango + citrus + tomato leaf, then a few minutes later the florals appear (mostly lotus). Now when I'm working in my garden I get excited when I smell my tomato plants because it reminds me of this perfume! Perfect hot weather scent, if only it had better longevity. You better keep a travel spray in your bag if you want to wear this one. Otherwise, think of it as a morning pick me up like an olfactory glass of orange juice or shot of espresso because it'll be gone by the time you get to the office. Still, nice work from Ellena and I think the best of the Jardins. I'm a man, and I love this on women. I just can't have enough of this smell. It projects happiness, joy and confidence. Women I smelled wearing this scent walk with confidence and their face radiate joy. I remember this was one of my samples back in the day. I didnt really think nothing of it because it was a citrus floral scent, that i took for a woman type scent. So I just spray it on just for the hell of it.
Man I walked in the post office and must have blew everyone away. I had like 3 people in the same area either complimenting or agreeing that it smelled so good. The ultimate spring fragrance! However, should have been EDP I love wearing this but am guessing I'm in the opposite boat from some of the other reviewers here: my favorite part of the fragrance is the opening, and I think it's pretty but very average after the top notes are gone, which happens much faster after application than I hoped. I love the vegetal stuff going on up top with the tomato leaf especially, it's a very unique opening so I think I'll use this bottle faster than average due to respraying more often throughout the day. Length of wear and sillage are short to average; the formula I have is EDT so this is one I might like more in the EDP form if it exists. This fragrance seems like it would fit well with any age group or gender. I loved it when I tried it on a test strip in the shop: I was looking for green and I got it: fresh green subtle spice. I decided it was the best in the range and bought it. Now I'm horrified by the top notes: I smell urine! Quel horreur! I'm hoping it's because I'm recovering from a cold. Very WORRIED! Update: took my perfume sprayed arm to perfume counter and asked for a consultant's opinion. It was not only identified correctly but described it in a positive way. I guess my cold distorted my sense of smell... parosmia. Opening horrible but heart and base notes worth waiting for.
this one is such a good example for 'do not buy perfume right away when you first sniffed it' 
I don't like opening, it's weird almost bad but doesn't fully bad, smell like dry orange and dry powder and slightly green in it.
I'm glad that carrot or tomato do not stay long on my skin
otherwise I would hate this perfume
the heart notes are amazing lotus is such a nice scent of flower for hot weather, very refreshing but not too aquatic or not too cold like Elizabeth Arden green tea or Avon Haiku, it is just right amount of freshness and uplifting scent lean to feminine side.
base notes are nice as well, I can smell iris (my favorite)
and cinnamon such a weird combination but really nice. At first sniff this reminded me of Elizabeth Arden - Green Tea, so I was disappointed because it costs 3x as much...but the dry down now that was/ is something else. A magical deep fresh sophisticated and rich mango lemon juice. Longevity is excellent at least on me and the further it fades the more beautiful it gets. At certain moments I still get the EA vibe but that's ok..I just take a deeper sniff. P.S. nothing against green tea, just find it a bit violent at times, but own it too. My signature scent!
I just love this fragrance!
A unique scent that smells so different to everything else in my collection
I never realized that vegetable scents can smell so wonderful!
I must smell like a green grocer as I tend to drown myself with at least 10 sprays every time I apply this liquid magic.
After reading the reviews here, it obvious that this juice doesn't appeal to everyone, so before you commit $$$ to buying a full bottle, it might be a good idea to get a sample first.
Cheers The opening of this is so interesting on me - the grapefruit is dry and powdery, and mixed with the green mango and tomato leaf it conjures almost a chalky feeling. I was trying to figure out *exactly* what it reminded me of - and then it hit me. 
The smell of a freshly opened bottle of fruit flavored chewable antacids (or is it conjuring the *taste* of said antacids? you know how something can smell just exactly the way something tastes? but not actually smell like said thing? i haven't quite got that figured out). 
Luckily this stage doesn't last too long on me (I don't hate it but I still don't like being reminded of antacid tablets). The chalky feeling goes away quickly and soon I'm left with mostly grapefruit, with an aquatic feeling from the lotus and the tomato leaf peeking out all crisp and bold in the background. I don't know if I'm smelling bulrush because I don't know what bulrush smells like, but it's definitely green, crisp, fresh, and effervescent. 
This is one of those fragrances that is the antidote to feeling dirty and sweaty. Perfect for just after a shower on a very hot day. Calming and confident and perfectly unisex. 
I love all the Jardins but I think out of 4 I'd put this at #3 - Toit and Li coming in first and second, and Mousson last. Green salad kind of fragrance .
New experinse This one smells terrible on my skin :(( Instead of a juicy mango, all i can get is that annoying, gross tomato leaf and some vetiver, smells like mud :((( A big NO! for me. Debbie Downer for that one.
Do you know the smell of bluish exhaust fumes of Trabant or Wartburg (in early 80-ties) + geranium/lemon + incense + something marshy indeed (maybe it's sweet flag). Very cold.
Mixture of rose and incense in the base reminds me Cabaret Gres. It's very elegant note. I know unripe mango has a very peculiar odor to it (turpentine, gasoline, carrot), but when I close my eyes only thing to think of is Trabant starting off :/ This is my favourite of the Jardin bunch. I was looking for an office friendly fragrance and I fell in love with this one. It's so fresh and aquatic that you really don't have to worry about smelling unclean during a busy and stressful day. And the fantastic thing about it is that it's not sharp like some aquatic and fresh scents are. Despite being very fresh it maintains softness.
Thus, this is my stressful-day-ahead -fragrance. Works every time and is truly a life saver in summer heat. Bought it based on the reviews. But don't like it much. Please order a sample if you have a plan to buy it. PM me if you're in India for swap. This was my signature scent for a good few years. After years of wearing it, I realized that I actually never liked the opening of this scent. The dry down is a beautiful, watery fragrance, but it only stays that way for maybe an hour. And in general, this wears off on me pretty quickly. I get maybe 4 hours out of it and part of that is the sharp opening note that I'm not even that fond of. 
For the money, I decided that it was time to look for a new signature scent. This is definitely better in the warmer weather, too. In winter, the fragrance stays quite sharp and never reaches that pretty, fluffy watery state. That being said, I haven't completely given up on this one. I'm interested in the whole Jardin line and hopefully some of the other ones last longer on me. 
Oh yah, it's kind of a chameleon so you get different scents depending on when you spray. So if you like complex fragrances, this is a good one. Y'all are going to laugh, but on my skin the most prominent note is incense, which is the scent they hit you with ON BLAST at Disney World Florida when you're on that ride in Epcot (the giant golf ball) and you discover ROME IS BURNING!!! But I digress... Obviously this fragrance is above and beyond that. I don't want to trivialize anything about this masterpiece because it is an experience like no other. The citrus notes are absolutely gorgeous and awaken the senses. The incense note is smoky and luxurious, so much so that I am transported to a dark clay chamber where artists are painting hieroglyphs by the light of perfumed torches. Sur le Nil evokes citrus groves, a cornucopia of vegetables, something aquatic, and something smoky and mysterious. My god, some perfumes smell ""good"" and we attach personal significance to them because of this, that, and the other--BUT THIS ladies and gentlemen, transports you to a place with no time. What a pleasure, a treasure, and a masterpiece. Close your eyes and smell this. You have to at least once in your life.
For summer--summer all the way--and for those moments when you need a vacation but can't quite put your life on hold just yet. The note list for Un Jardin Sur Le Nil is pretty unique, but honestly, I don't get a lot of the more interesting notes, though that could be due to me not really knowing what they smell like individually, so it's tough to pick them.
What I do get is a blast of grapefruit and mango in the opening that's very fresh and juicy. It's definitely the flesh of the fruit you get. The two together give an interesting mix of sweet and sour, with an almost plastic-y feel, though it's not at all unpleasant nor synthetic smelling. After these two dominating citruses relax, which takes about 30 minutes, the florals, noticeably the lotus and peony, peek through and a subtle floral sweetness flitters in and out of composition, which makes the whole thing smell very romantic and slightly mysterious. I'd say that ""romantic"" is the best word to sum this scent up for me. It does a fantastic job at conjuring up a romantic, secret garden vibe, with hints of rain and fresh vegetation. Overall I think it's a wonderful fragrance that's light, airy, fresh and slightly exotic. I wish the incense made a little more of an appearance, but you can't have it all I suppose.
The performance, as has been mentioned is poor, which is the scents biggest letdown. I get a big citrus for about 2 hours, then a soft, skin scent with the florals and the citrus taking more of a back seat for another couple of hours and then poof, it's gone. 
For a refined, fresh day scent in spring/summer or a rainy day scent in the fall/winter, this is impeccable based purely on the smell though. One for the romantics and the dreamers. Despite its longevity issues, I can't help being in love with this. It's fragile, beautiful and unique enough to warrant a place on any shelf, male, female, young and old. Class as always from JCE. To me, this is the olfactory equivalent to the earliest of Monet's Waterlilies had he painted them with watercolors. I get grapefruit, mango, and lotus, nothing else. One question though - what, exactly, do bulrushes actually smell like? Because when I think of them, I think of marsh gasses, and this most definitely does not smell like that! 
I thought Sur la Toit was my favorite Jardin, but Sur la Nil is giving that one some serious competition! A lot has been written about this scent – very few fragrances have had entire books written about their creation – but there are a few things that stand out about it and should be emphasized: for starters, no scent with as high of a commercial profile as UJSLN has plant elements this convincingly realistic-smelling. It was a stroke of brilliance to base the profile of a scent on the savory nature of vegetables rather than pulling the sweetness from fruit. As a result, UJSLN achieves an adult-style vision of freshness that exceeds the boundaries of only green plants and citruses. While the anchor is the much-mentioned green mango note, the presence of the tomato/tomato leaf and carrots balances the scent in a mature direction while not threatening its lightness and fresh character. While marketed primarily for women, Un Jardin Sur Le Nil is unisex in a way that puts it outside the frameworks of gender altogether due to its vegetal and botanical sensibilities.
The performance is the weak link here and is as fleeting as its reputation dictates but there is one way to get around it: spray it on clothing. For a scent as complex as UJSLN it does end up playing out in a linear way both on skin and on fabrics. Spray it on your sleeves or collar to keep it around longer and the projection is respectable this way also. Very clear character with the Mango top note. Fresh, smooth and very well done. I’m a guy in my 30’s and I love this since I live in a tropical country that has 7,107 islands. So, that gives me a reason to use this everyday and the sweetness is not in a cloying way. 
Forget Virgin Island Water, I can’t stand the smell of that perfume and it does not remind me of my island home in the South Pacific. It is too heavy for me kinda like a suntan lotion. To be honest, Un Jardin Sur Le Nil and that inexpensive Tommy St Barts is more suitable for an islander like me. I am not knocking down Creed since I have Aventus, GIT and Original Santal. The mango is really prominent in this one for me. It makes me think of being on a sunny tropical island- it’s nice, but not really fitting with what I normally gravitate towards. My new summer love, a must have! When a perfume or any kind of masterpiece is pure magic I don't care if it's mainstream or 13 years old. 
Lime+bamboo+musk and a papyrus, flax linen or cotton feeling. 
The smell of Adam and Eve's garden of Eden, or Cleopatra's signature scent. 
Also it reminds me to Audrey Hepburn at Breakfast at Tiffany's as the fragrance is so carefree, ""brazilian"" bossanova, refined, bright, elegant and eternal/timeless as she and her diamonds are. This is beautiful green transparent summer scent. It acts like metallic aquatic perfume reminiscent of rain, leaning towards masculine than feminine. I could smell lotus and hyacinth. It's great when you need something minimalistic. This fragrance is very nice for summers and smells very citric. Although other people say it smells like a garden, that isn't really the case for me as I smell mainly sweet citruses, particularly a strong and realistic orange note (which makes the whole thing smell similar to Atelier Cologne's Orange Sanguine in my opinion). I do smell the mango in this, but I think Polo Black has a better take on mango (Polo Black has salted mangos while this has the sweet kind). There is a hint of a sweet fig note in the background as well, along with a very mild hint of green notes. But it isn't green enough to smell like a garden in my opinion. I also don't detect the garden note of carrot much (although maybe I do but haven't been able to detect its aroma). There is a slight aquatic vibe underneath the whole thing as well. Overall it's nice with subtle sillage and ok longevity in the summer, but isn't as green as I'd like and leans a bit feminine.
4/5 This is a masterpiece! It really smells like a garden. My wife was with me when I tried it and when I did I told her that I'm smelling tomato in it and she did not believe it, we checked the notes and we found tomato indeed along with other amazing notes. Its just a fabulous fragrance! Oh wow magnificent! Guerlain take notes, in an ideal world this is how aqua allegoria is supposed to smell and perform in sillage and longevity. I'm eating a juicy mango and citrus salad in a garden el fresco. Quality ingredients and a masterful composition, longevity is a few hours before turning to a skin scent. This sits close where I like it. 
Another gem from Ellena, Un Jardin sur Le Nil only works on me when it's warm outside. In heavy summer rotation, I can't imagine being without it. Africa? Mango? Incense? I'm very surprised that this doesn't get compared to the mighty Timbuktu. Though while L'Artisan's cult classic embraces everything heady and ceremonial, Sur Le Nil abandons all that in favor of a more rained out, vegetal approach. Mango and grapefruit start the party, but it's a green, unripe mango that is more bitter than it is sweet. A gentle incense drifts in the background, and as the name implies: it's all very garden like. Whenever I try Ellena's work I'm always immediately reminded of one specific thing: water ripples. Sur Le Nil is no exception. The scent is every bit as wet and cleansing as you'd expect from something inspired by a river. Heat and humidity will accompany this one well. A masterful summer fragrance and one that is truly unisex. There's a hint of carrot and tomato that can be a little weird from time to time, but overall it's a winner in my book. Sour citrus - very pleasant and refreshing. Perfect for summer. Green. Hmmm this smells just like EA's green tea on me! I dont mind it! But I think for the price, EA's green tea is better. This is a nice fresh citrus green tea scent to my nose. Great for summer : ) I do not know the art and science of perfume, and I am learning about the top, heart and base notes from people on this site that do know such things. I have tried this perfume twice, and fell in love with it both times the moment I sprayed it on --but the problem is that it goes nowhere with time. The first sniff and the 30 minutes later sniff are lovely and mysterious. After that, it just flattened out and disappeared on me. I really enjoyed this from an artistic stand point but I didn’t find this one wearable for casual use.
Un Jardin Sir li nil is a very sharp,green,citrusy scent that has some sweetness and an aromatic nature from melon and a nice incense vibe in the background making this a very interesting scent ! I did really enjoy this when I smelled it in the air but for some reason this type of scent just doesn’t go well with my personality and if honestly only wear this if I was on vacation in a tropical setting.
Performance on this is great for a freshie and lasts 6-10 hours and projects very well !
Overall rating-6.5 great scent but it’s not appealing to me or others (fiancée said it was too sharp) What can I say about the scent that is not already said by its name? This smells like a spring/summer garden breeze. A gorgeous mix of freshly cut grass (probably the tomato leaf), mixed flowers and fresh vegetables/fruit . It truly smells like a garden. I could probably count the perfumes I've encountered that has actually succeeded with that on one hand. I'm truly impressed!
So what's the main drawback? Exactly the same as the aforementioned strengths. If everyone wanted to smell like a garden, this wouldn't be a unique scent. While I enjoy the life-like carrot-, grapefruit-, and tomato-notes, I think many others will dislike the idea of smelling like food and random plants. The magic of this lies in its ability to awaken memories from gardens and happy moments. I'm not sure the experience would be quite the same for someone who associates these smells to a refrigerator or the produce section of a supermarket.
On me personally, this lasts for a long time, but stays discrete and close to the skin throughout the wear. I find that ideal. 
Being Hermes, it is very expensive. But it is also well crafted and hard to find a cheaper replacement for. I think we look for different things in perfumes. This might not be for those looking for just any perfume that smells nice, but rather for those who want a very specific and unique perfume. Personally, I'm not sure this is worth the price for me.
SUMMARY: This is a true garden scent, that will probably appeal to a specific audience rather than to ""everyone"". It is unique and can thus be found very strange by some. Among vegetable garden scents, it's so well crafted it might be without rival. Unfortunately I must be anosmic to this because I can barely smell it only seconds after spraying it. And i sprayed 3 times in the same spot. There's barely anything. I do get a bit of a fresh cucumber/green smell but it is so light I have to bury my nose in and almost hurt myself from sniffing so hard. 
Not worth the effort, and I don't wear perfumes that I can't smell on myself This fragrance is so skillfully made that it evolves & changes during drydown. Tried it after reading Chandler Burr's book about its creation but was initially not wild about the strong fruity mango that stands out upon application, but man did it become something magical after a little time. Beautiful scent that is a work of art,unusual but in the best possible way Similar to TdH???? No way!!! UJSLN is the epitome of transparency, just like a cool breeze carrying smells of freshly cut grass and delicate flowers that grow near the water. Clean, fresh and luxuriously unique. PERFECT fragrance for spring/summer!!! I love it and it's probably one of the best smells ever, but I think chanel said it best. A rose smells beautiful but a woman should not smell like one. (Or a carrot or tomato or mango for that matter). It's a great perfume for easter but it doesn't have that mysterious edge making it a good signature Update: 
I finally bought Un Jardin Sur Le Nil. Stay tuned. :-) 
I tried this fragrance about two months ago in 85+ degree temperatures. My initial impression of this fragrance was, ""it smells nice"", and ""this can easily be worn by a man"". 
However, I didn't want to pay full retail for it, but I am going to buy this fragrance at a discounted price in the next few weeks, as the weather warms up. I really liked how this fragrance evolves during its life cycle, and how suitable it is in hot and humid temperatures. I was really shocked when I tried it in dutty free...I was expecting something nice according to reviews, but on me the smell was so vegetal, like I touched tomato right before...I had to wash it right away. Maybe u ought not to keep it a secret to help ensure discontuation UNIQUE, DIVINE!
Every time I wear this perfume strangers ask me ""what is that beautiful smell?"" I am starting to keep it a secret. I absolutely adore this scent, it makes me happy on a cloudy day and it cools me down in the hot summer months. So complex and so perfect. Crisp like a cold breeze ,beautiful like palace gardens ,fresh as a mountain stream !
This really is amazing ,amazing for the summer ,whilst being a perfect unisex scent ,the weird and wonderful notes give this a unique edge ,it really is a garden fragrance ,extremely green and sharp /sappy What bizarre notes. My man loves this Forgot to mention this reminds me a little of Chanel’s chance vive At first sniff I wasn’t sold, it was slightly masculine which I know it’s unisex but still lol and smelled like a nice soap...and after a few minutes it warmed up to be a soft slightly sweet fragrance and almost to me, had a Burberry London scent , lemon I smell and apple I smell , kinda warm ,a bit spicy just a tad and nice for being called a green scent , I’ll hold onto the sample but I’m not in love so I will not be purchasing this One This perfume smells very similar to Yves Roche Cuir Vetiver minus the green mango and tomato notes. Very green, with a hint of sweetness I was introduced to this fragrance by Hotel Taiwana in St Barths, where they give Hermes products (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap) in this scent. The scent is so light and green. It's a very unique take on a fresh fragrance. I really enjoyed it. Unfortunately I had to pass this perfume after the purchase, it is too veggie for me, felt like a salad while wearing it. Nice citrus touch though. I was aiming to purchase a bottle but fortunately I decided to go for a couple more test spritzes at the shop first. During the 2nd and 3rd tries, the vegetal notes started to seem far more prominent than I first noticed. They're interesting, and nicely done, but vegies aren't for me when it comes to perfume. I could clearly smell them as carrot and tomato, rather than just amorphic vegetal notes. Could have been the power of suggestion, but for whatever reason, they jumped out at me and they didn't sit well. I must admit I only noticed the vegies that strongly when the fragrance was radiating off my skin in very hot weather. But since that's exactly the kind of weather I'd be looking to wear a light citrus floral such as this, that's not much good for me. 
I did like the fresh citrus element however. The grapefruit is nice, smooth and refreshing. Not like the chemical nose-jarring blast you get from some perfumes that have grapefruit. This is an amazing summer scent that unfortunately doesn't last long. That's my only gripe.
On first sniff, I get fresh, citrus but sweet. It's not bitter/sour like a lot of citrus openings. It's more tangerine, mandarin, and orange than lime/lemon. Sweet but not crazy, still very citrusy. At the same time, it smells very green, like freshly cut grass or grass after a heavy rainfall. It's earthy and fresh at the same time.
As it dries down, I get a stronger fruity note, and it becomes too difficult to pick out exactly what it smells like. It reminds me of Sunny D but fancy--orangey sweet but there's something about it that makes it lean more mimosa. It's absolutely beautiful but becomes a very faint skin scent after 3-4 hours.
It almost doesn't smell like perfume; that's how natural this smells. It's absolutely beautiful and I see it as more feminine than unisex. Quite a shame that it doesn't last long. Such a bright and uplifting scent. Another masterpiece from Jean Claude Ellena. This fragrance is the most beautiful warm day in a bottle. It smells so natural and pure, but most of all it is so unique. Fruity, floral, and green! The only perfume in the series I don't like. I bought in inertia and without a sample, because I like everyone else but it was a very bad purchase. It definitely didn't meet my expectations and my skin didn't stand well. Something in it caused a reaction to vomiting, which definitely refused me to wear it. Is a pleasure use this delicate parfume that becomes almost like eau de toilet. I use it during the very hot days, makes you feel so fresh and original. Is clear that has citrics since a kind of reaction is felt in the skin when the sun is directly over you, nothing to be worried just like a little bit chilly but delicious. Some people around say that smells like green tea, just like the grass just cut but more exquisite, with citrus and some flowers but very disecrete. I do not very well how to describe it, but definitively if you like fresh smells and a kind of discrete smells is perfect. Men always will ask you what is it. Some advertisements say that is unisex, maybe is because they love it too. The perfect smell to start the day for a very active day. I would love a little bottle to take with me in the afternoon.
Reading the notes before writting, yes I guess that magician smell that takes you to another place is lotus. I do not know exactly how it smells, but it is exquisite and humble, a very rare combination. A green masterpiece with the likes of Davidoff Good Life and GIT I am loving wearing this during our hot season, it is fresh and sparkling and tangy. On me the citrus is a little muffled but the bulrush is there. I feel quite lighthearted and confident in this. Great for day time, and not too sweet. Un Jardin Sur Le Nil is simply fantastic. Gently yet heady, a bit tangy, sweet yet herbal, fresh and clean, luminous yet earthy, alive with the waters that dance inside green things - and it's so fantastically unique with its accords of rushes, carrot, tomato. I sniffed it early in my perfume obsession, before I really knew much of notes, but knew that it was different and knew that it was first-rate. I love, love, love it all. This is super similar to Le Jardin de Monsieur Li but if you look at the pyramids they look nothing alike. Bit random. Anyway I think Li, it lasts longer but this one is slightly more complex composition but personaly I prefer Li's simple freshness. Dont get both just choose one.
⛤⛤⛤⛤ I'm fond of this without every getting too excited about it. It is fresh, delicate and elegant (for men and women). It is a useful choice in summer for office or professional settings because it lasts well but wears quietly. Despite the citrus notes, Nil's fruity accord sets it apart from drier, traditional citrus/herbal colognes like 4711, O de Lancome or Eau de Givenchy (among many others). Nil withstands humidity very well too. 
My only qualification is that on me Nil is rather linear once the initial notes settle. I tend to lose interest in it. It does have a nice habit of returning late in the day if my skin suddenly heats up, after a quick dash to the bus stop for instance. Verdict: not a masterpiece, but pleasing, and more useful than many masterpieces of modern perfumery. What a perfectly lovely, classy scent!
Un Jardin sur le Nil opens with a bite of fresh, green citrus, then mellows into a gentle lotus scent for the remainder of the wear time. This reminds me so much of a water lily or lotus fragrance I’ve smelled before, but the memory is so faint that it seems to be from another lifetime; quite a dreamy moment for me. Also, I must say, I am SHOCKED this was created in 2005! It feels like it would’ve been a cornerstone fragrance for this brand and would’ve been around since Hermès’ beginning. And a quick note of praise to the print ads for this fragrance – I don’t think I’ve ever seen a fragrance visually described so perfectly. The peaceful lily sitting on a pond of gently rippling water on a quiet, overcast day … that IS this perfume.
My only disappointment is that I can’t pick up on the complexity suggested by the note composition. I only get citrus and lotus, with maybe the slightest hint of carrot. I wish I could smell the musk, incense, and cinnamon mingle with the florals; that would’ve been an interesting combination to experience! Maybe, though, the supporting notes melt into the florals so well that they don’t take away from the softness of the fragrance. Maybe this perfume is just THAT well-blended. 
Super soft sillage but moderate longevity.
A classic fragrance; truly magical. A juicy citrus floral. Soft, feminine, and likeable; a somewhat uninspired warm weather aquatic. Has that characteristic Jean-Claude Ellena transparency - seems to disappear but persists in a weirdly indefatigable way - but not as interesting in its composition as some of Ellena's other creations. BUT it's Hermes so it's beautifully put together and made with quality ingredients. If you're looking for a lovely, pleasant, safe, prettty little thing for warmer weather you can't go wrong with this fragrance. Smells elegant and last. One night, I was walking inside a high end mall. Then I got a whiff of this worn by an elegant lady. I followed her im 100% sure it was this. That iris powdery mango lotus floral harmony can not be other perfume. I can say that this was good also at night. It smells like chilling on the riverside while fresh mango trees gives aromas.
Pros: elegant, unique, soulful, uplifting, light, wonderful projection smells different depending on the temperature. Reflects hermes love for simplexity.
Cons: smells petroleum on the drydown to make it last.
First impression: mango, iris ethereal powder. 
Floral peonies, iris, lotus.
Fruity carrot, mango
Unisexy floral unisex fruity with a musk and incense. Smells really clean because of the iris. The grapefruit is there just to kick the heart notes and middle notes. Then it will disappear after bringing the base notes and middle notes to your nose. This is a fragrance that (for me) it really depends on skin chemistry, it was a blind buy and on my skin first it was fresh for a few minutes but then it changed, a real stinker note came up, I had to scrub it of, and I forced it on my male friend, that was a year ago. A few weeks back he used it and I liked the smell, so yesterday we did a test, we used it at the same time, Again on me after 2 minutes a real rotten stinker,n him a very good fresh scent that stayed... It is a unisex scent but on my female skin a bad stinker, on my partners skin a pleasant good scent...so it remains his.... I have never been a fan of citrus-based perfumes. To me, they can either be too astringent or too close to house cleaning products, but the minute I smelled Un Jardin Sur Le Nil I fell in love. The grapefruit is vibrant and sparkling, but the watery lotus mellows the grapefruit enough to keep it from becoming astringent. Then the iris unfolds into a light powdery aroma, while the incense and cinnamon keep the scent grounded. On me, I never get the smell of tomatoes or carrot, just an uplifting citrus-floral. I wear this on rainy days when the freshness of the air just makes this scent intoxicatingly gorgeous. As long as Hermes keeps making Un Jardin Sur Le Nil I will keep this in my perfume collection. A work of art. I own a small sample bottle gifted to me along with three other Hermes scents. The notes intrigued me so I was eager to try it first. So interesting, fresh, and natural. Expensive but the best art is. This is a crafted perfume meant to take you on a journey. On my skin there's a fresh combination of carrot, tomato, mango and grapefruit. Don't be put off by the unique combo - the notes reveal themselves in such an elegant composition. Not like anything else you'll try. It's not my everyday feminine gourmand but it brightens up my world every time I wear it. I'd say it's definitely unisex, which makes it less of a go to scent for me, but it's worth the experience. It'll make you appreciate the art of perfume. How does one explain this? It's so many things :)
I would not have even known about this had I not randomly inherited a book called "" The Perfect Scent: A Year Inside the Perfume Industry in Paris and New York"" by Chandler Burr.
Great book! It's the story of how this scent was created while at the same time, SJP was having her ""Lovely"" scent created by Coty. Some fun here!
Anyway, this perfume is complex and intriguing. So many notes, my oh my.
You can let your imagination run wild while you drink in the swirling blend of all the scents you thought you'd never imagine loving in a perfume and somehow you sniff yourself ragged trying to get them all in.
Tomato?? Come on in. Carrot? Sit right down. Mango...ahhhh mango. Come settle in here. Am I getting healthier just sniffing you guys?The rest of you? You have a place at my table!
This is a masterpiece. Fabulous sillage, lovely longevity. 
I wore this one day at work and hugged a well established client who has access to my cell number and received this text "" ...Oh and by the way...I've been smelling something incredible on my shirt all day. What IS that? Whatever it is, I've been smiling all day..."" I don't have a sophisticated nose. All those ""tender violets"" or ""aquatic lotus delights"" are simply off the mark. 
My perfume perception is straight to the point and not affected by commercials or advertisement concepts :) 
If Jardin Sur le Nil smells like a freshly squeezed carrot juice, then it smells like a freshly squeezed carrot juice. What did I pay my money for?! Becoming a star at the rabbit party? Lol. Un Jardin Sur Le Nil is definitely worthy of the praise that it gets. Very citrusy and uplifting in the beginning, but once it settles down, I get some earthyness mixed with bulrush and lotus leaves (even if lotus leaves are not in the note breakdown). Great for those hot summer days when you want to refresh your senses and teleport to the gardens by the river Nile. Do sample it, I am certain that once the sample is done you will want a whole bottle. It made me felt in love since the first smell. Original as I have not smelled before. Recreates an exotic place.
Fresh, fruity and delicate. Not scandalous and smells more far than excpected. Oneself can be in acquitance easily but others get the essence. People who did not smelled before are curious about it. You will be asked what is it.
Expensive and original, but truly is a great investment for your originality and your pleasure.
Their freshness makes you do not feel tired of the smell. Can be used in the morning or at noon, even afternoon. The sillage keeeps for longer than expected.
Ideal for those who love green and fresh aromas. I first smelled this scent 5 years ago on my way back home from the Philippines, stopping by Taiwan Airport first. 
I had just finished my 1 week visit and funeral in Manila. 
It was an emotional time for me, because my 1st wife just died from cancer.
As I was walking along the airport terminal, 
I looked up and saw this green transparent bottle from the House of Hermes.
I had heard of them before from Youtubers and thought I give it a try with their tester. 
I sprayed only one spritz on my wrist after a nice smell from the bottle itself. 
After walking away for a few minutes, I stopped and asked myself, 
""What is that smell?? Who just walked by me?""
I had just walked by a lady whom I thought had on this nice, elegant, unique, classy, and refreshing scent. 
I kept on walking, and realized that this scent followed me. 
I stopped again and asked, ""Where is that smell coming from? Wait, it can't be that Hermes that I just sprayed on my wrist."" 
I lifted up my dead arm to smell my wrist. 
Sure enough, that smell was me! I couldn't believe it! How can a fragrance give off this type of aroma? It completely changed in smell after just 30 mins.
I kept smelling it, as it uplifted my spirit from a very down and emotional one. 
Un Jardin Sur Le Nil put a smile on my face. 
I'm not saying this is the best fragrance I've ever had or smelled, but it darn sure is one of the most unique ones ever. 
It was this fragrance that made me realize that a smell can really change a person's mood. 
From an emotional or down one, to a uplifted spirit. 
A sad face to a smiley face...
After finding out about the book, ""The Perfect Scent"" I then realized how much work was put into this fragrance.
The House of Hermes created a winner. There's no such thing as a perfect scent, but they are close and
have been creating fragrances for more than a century.
I didn't have the money at the time to buy a bottle, because it was $100+. 
I knew that I had to have one someday when the money is there and there's a good deal going.
However, buyers BEWARE: if it's a limited edition or they decide to discontinue it, prices will skyrocket.
I found it this past week online (authentic), for more than half the price.
I had no clue what was in the notes when I first smelled it, but after looking it up on fragrantica, I can see where it all comes from.
Depending on the climate, this frag changes in different directions. With that being said, it may not be for everyone.
If you're a simplistic type of person, then this is NOT for you.
If you love adventure and love trying new things, this is for you.
If you love different things and consider yourself different or want to be different from others, this is for you.
Age group: 21+
3-4 sprays max
Climate: Summer nights, Spring, Fall days
Sillage: 4 stars
Longevity: 4 stars
Versatility: 4.5 stars
Scent: 5 stars
Overall: 4.75 stars This to me is by far the most beautiful fragrance I own. It transcends gender in a way that only beauty can. The moment you try to describe it, it becomes less than what it is. This is something where the whole is so much more than the sum of its parts. Where every note is beautifully smooth and balanced. In short, a bottle of Zen.
This is my best fragrance when I am moving about in the oppressive humidity of South East Asia. It's also my default olfactory pick me up when the heat becomes overly sticky and I need to lift my spirits. This is beautifully suited for taking tea on the terrace of the Mandarin Oriental and would also be my first choice visiting a forgotten temple on the banks of a river. This is what I wear when I want an afternoon to linger or a morning remembered. همانطور که از نام عطر پیداست (باغی در اطراف رود نیل) ما با یک عطری که غالب بویش فلورال هست مواجه هستیم. البته در این عطر که کار استاد مسلم روایح؛ آقای ژان کلود النا هست؛ با هیچیک از نتهای تشکیل دهنده ی عطر بطور مستقیم مواجه نمیشیم و در طول عمر عطر؛ میکسی از روایح هست که به مشام میرسه. در واقع آقای ژان کلود النا در اینجا عطر رو بصورت آکورد کامل ارایه کرده. البته اگه بیشتر بخواهم در این عطر کنکاش کنم؛ شاید بتوان بوی گل نیلوفر آبی رو در این عطر در لحظاتی کشف کرد؛ ولی نتهای عطر؛ همونطور که گفتم اصلا واضح نیست.
بعد از حدود سه ربع؛ عطر یکم بوی تند و تیز پیدا میکنه. حالتی شبیه به اینکه در ساختار کلی عطر فلفل اضافه شده باشه. اگرچه در نتهای عطر به فلفل اشاره ای نشده؛ ولی انگار فلفل میاد و روی سایر روایح قرار میگیره. این حالت تیزی برای عطری تابستونی بنظرمن یکم سنگینه و اون حالت شادابی که یه عطر تابسوتی باید داشته باشه رو تحت تاثیر قرار میده
----------------------------------
A garden around nil river...
you can guess from this name that it is floral like. Yes! it is... 
Mr Ellena created a perfume that you can't detect any notes separately. We are faced to an accord.
I could detect only lotus flower in notes, but it is too opaque.
After 45 minute, perfume become ardent. In notes, doesn't expressed pepper, but I say that after 45 minute, you smell an accord with peppery effect. The truest grapefruit I've smelled and a strong tomato leaf. The carrot is also really noticeable making this exactly the vegetable scent I was hoping for. The floral notes are understated but I do get the iris in the drydown. My only complaint is that it only lasted about 6 hours. I loooooovvvvvve it Extraordinarily fresh fragrance. The opening gives the impression the room just got brighter. After that it remains dominated by grapefruit, slightly over-pushing the grapefruit note to the point where it compromises the sense of a 'blend', the feeling of composition, and risks smelling cheap. Projection is very good. It really does evoke the feeling of a cool breeze over an expanse of water coloured by tropical fruits and grasses. However, a little bit in the posh handsoap/air freshener category rather than fragrance. As something to enhance an airy summer's day it would go very well. The bulrush is a unique note, one I've not smelt before, and complements the Grapefruit well. To my nose there isn't much in the way on Mango (which is a shame, it's a lovely scent!).
I wouldn't say it was Jean-Claude Ellena's best work, but it certainly nice enough. It instantly makes me think of humid, possibly swampy areas (perhaps the Everglades?), and is my go to for humid, muggy days. This perfume is owed many superlatives. I grew up in Central Africa and the mango notes remind me of blistering summer days cooled by the taste of green mangoes. It is a tropical rain on hot skin. It is running out to shake the raindrops from the umbrella trees. Nostalgia in a beautiful water-green bottle. Zesty, tangy, fresh, crisp, sweet uplifting scent. Beautiful. Just beautiful, and this is not a word that I easily throw around. If you haven't smelt this, find the nearest store, do yourself a favor and smell it-spray it on your inner wrist and if you have a handkerchief spray on that too. I can guarantee that you wont stop sniffing your wrist on your way home. This is what happened to me. If you're lucky, the scent will be on your wrist the next day. I would want wear this in all seasons if it could hold up. Unfortunately, I don't see this working in the colder weather. I will still try it in the winter this year to see what happens. Longevity is not insane- above average.
If I ever become an expectant father, I would love to smell like this when my child is born. Very natural, elegant, expensive smell. i bought it months ago..all i can say is this is so original..natural and pleasant. Very well blended juice, smell fruits, herbs and vegetables pop up in the opening, thick but not powdery or sweet and not bitter at all, fruity and green..The base is floral + musk and lighter, sometimes i feel it's too light. Sillage, projection aren't good, longevity only 4 hours (and close to the skin). This is not typical compliment getter fragrance, but more like aromatherapy for the users..very fresh and natural (it's pricey, though) 7,8/10 Received this fragrance as a gift. I would never ever buy a perfume with carrots and tomato as top note, just don't want to smell like a 'health shake'. A sniff of it reveals a sweet citrus grapefruit tonic n fresh cucumber vibes, though cucumber is not listed. I know the above mentioned ingredients r straight off a food recipe. For a perfume, Bizarre but in a good way. Man I m loving it, fresh, clean, safe, soft and strangely, smells expensive too. Indeed a uni, but there are times the scent leans a little feminine I guess the lotus/peony/iris plays a part here, but then the musk n woods stepped out as to remind there's a man in the house too. All in all a good, safe and wonderful perfume with a green signal for all season. I m loving my bizarre beautiful gift, stroking it ;) Beautiful 
I feel mango at first, then fruit and vegetable 
Good for hot days. And I can share this with my wife. Feel happy,colorful and attractive i just received this and i smell divine.!! everything about it exudes luxury, sophistication and class from the fine mist sprayer to the bottle and box. the scent is just gorgeous! i feel like i'm floating in a bubble of prettiness, singing a silly song. very uplifting.
sillage is moderate and then settles close to skin. still testing longevity.
this is the first blind buy that i have been totally and utterly over the moon about :)
update, longevity is moderate but it is an eau de toilette. I just buy yesterday and try it today. It open with this nice slightly bitter grapefruit aroma, which is pretty refreshing then it change into.something green and fresh smell that is pretty relaxing i would say. 
The vibe i got is like I am.in these nice vacation in sokewhere that is somehow a cool place with lush of greenery around pond.
Somehow there is some sweetness that add joyful feeling in these masterpiece. 
The silage is awesome, i mean, even just the moment i.open the cap, I can already smell it. And when i spray it, wow, it fills my room instabeously ( i knew it cos my brother told me that my room smells nice when he enters it). Strong enough to fill the.room but not nauseating like some of those toxic waste perfume , seriously some.perfume are too strong that it can be.too nauseating. But this one is fresh and has the perfect silage. What about the longevity ? Well it does pretty good job. Like i am wearing it the whole day and people keep asking me the whole day what paerfume I use cause it smells so good and even i can.sniff it from my shirt. 
Money spend well I would say. At the end of the day it smells a little bit smoky (in a good way) and kinda sweet at the same time. Which i would say as a perfect perfume fir day to night transition. 
I had un jardin mediteranee abd both serve me really well. I would love to try sur le toit and apres le mouson also to see which one will be perfect for my everyday signature. But so far, this one is winning my heart This fragrance provokes my childhood memories of playing by the riverside where reeds and silver grasses grow in hot dry summer afternoon lingered by a bit humidity after a sudden thundershower, and also makes me think of my journey to Turkey. As a work of art, it is picturesque; as a perfume, it is too picturesque. But I appreciate it very much as it is so artistically pleasant.
Just like the song ""Pussywillows, cattails"". I think this is the best of the Jardin range personally. It's quite versatile too, I have worn it all year round in various settings. It certainly has JCE's signature all over it. In fact, it reminds me a lot of Dzongkha but with a slightly fresher opening with mango And grapefruit. It's the Iris and incense in it that gives me that impression I think. Lovely. fresh, green, bright, a slight sweet fruit note almost like coconut, aquatic, crisp yet not full bottle worthy in my opinion; does not smell rich, opulent or expensive, could be a cheap drugstore scent but I feel that way about most Hermes I first tested UN JARDIN SUR LE NIL this past autumn at a very expensive cosmetics boutique and although I thought it was lovely and intriguing, I couldn't bring myself to pay that much for just one bottle of fragrance, given how many I already own. So, I kept my eyes peeled for a good sale somewhere and finally purchased it a couple of months ago.
Although I’ve never been anywhere near the Nile, I’ve been around plenty of rivers, lakes and lily ponds, and this fragrance really does evoke that kind of environment for me: watery, green, earthy, and floral with some organic matter underneath. Oddly, although most reviewers have voted for a dominant grapefruit note, this is barely noticeable on me except as a trace of bitterness. For the most part, this is so smooth that I don’t pick up individual notes very much. 
It’s winter here now and I’ve been enjoying wearing this, but have the feeling that UN JARDIN SUR LE NIL will be at its best for me in spring and summer as the scent seemed even more rich when I happened to be in an over-heated room for awhile.
Reviews are divided as to whether or not this fragrance is unisex as marketed or if it’s actually more feminine. Per the statistically small sample of my husband and me, this is a unisex scent, although he’s not that much into green scents on himself. He does like it on me. Sillage is on the low end of moderate and the longevity on me is excellent, but this seems to vary significantly according to personal chemistry. In fact, it’s clear that personal chemistry plays a big role with this one in general, so blind buys might not be a safe option. بوی میوه های مخلوط آبدار و لهیده که شکوفه ای گلی شده

Overall: 6.4/10 I wanted to like it, but no. The grapefruit note is too strong and bitter for me, washing out everything else. Brings to mind Ananas Fizz, which has the same problem for me. Alas, I heard such good things about it. I spritzed this at a store today and it was really lovely. It's fresh sweet green, I think this is different than other Hermes perfumes I tried. I can actually picture myself wearing this one instead of other Hermes because I find it more ""down to earth"". This could appeal to younger wearer, or really anyone who wants to feel (and smell) young. I think it's a great alternative for Hermes. The screeching mango note makes this totally unwearable on me, but on my sister it is lush yet thoughtful, in the way of so many Hermes scents. This was a blind buy and I just ignored carrots and tomatoes being listed in the notes. I don't typically go for this type of perfume, but I live in a city where winter lasted so long that I wanted spring days in a bottle. While reading The Perfect Scent by Chandler Burr I learned that the carrots take on an apricot scent, and the tomatoes just add a vegetal tone to the perfume. I love most of Hermes' scents, Jean Claude Ellena as a nose, the theme of this fragrance being a garden on the Nile, and that it thrives in the spring and summer. Unisex doesn't bother me, but most people have said it leans feminine for them, and I agree. It will be interesting to wander through this garden in the summer heat. Soft grapefruit, green mango and a dusty/reedy accord, all in typically 'soft focus' JC Ellena style. It's fresh, green and easy to wear. I bought this on a whim and only smelled the cap and didn't even try it on a paper sample strip or on my wrist. On the cap it smelled sweetly citrusy and very green. Refreshing and relaxing. On my skin it just turns into pure, bitter grapefruit and not in a nice way, just very chemical and it's very much my skin's fault; my friend tried and it smelled lovely on her:(
I unfortunately regret buying this. 
P.S. if anyone wants to do an exchange for this perfume send me a PM (limited to Europe) It's a 50ml bottle only spritzed a few times, let me know what you'd be willing to exchange it for. A refreshing citrus-floral which has good performance...
I applied 6 heavy sprays
0-4 hours - 1 foot projection. This is a bright invigorating fragrance which is mostly citrus with a floral undertone.
4 hours - 6 hours - 6 inch projection
6 - 8 hours - 2 inch projection. Becomes more floral and more feminine. This now smells like a thinned out Hermes Jardin Mediterranean
Good I learned about this fragrance, 3 years ago when I discovered Fragrantica. I was checking the perfumes section and came up to this. Unfortunately, it wasn't available where I live and know I'm happy to be able buy this. I'm not sure how this fragrance smells and I'm not sure how long it will last. What I know is, this fragrance is known as one of the best unisex fragrances of all time. That must be good. Also, I bought it today from Amazon. 56 GBP for 100ml. It's sold and shipped by Amazon.(so it must be authentic) If you want to buy this it can be a good chance. 
I will update you on the details when it arrives.
I got it today and it is not fake. It's been 4 hours and it still radiates well enough for a summer fragrance. It's a citrusy scent and you will love it. Hermes fragrances are almost thoughtful in their design. This is my favorite. I get the most compliments on this one. It's light and bright yet rich and complex. It lifts you out of the dark winter into another place that is warm and light. Hermes does what fragrance is suppose to do, it drenches your senses and sends you somewhere you'd like to be, if only in your mind. Smells like the trunk of a Douglas fir to me. My wife said grapefruit. Really not bad, definitely not strong. I don't see a man really wearing this, so I say this is for her. We are not keeping the sample. A light ethereal scent quite like the whisper of green mangoes, fresh dewy grass and mild incense. I recently bought this for my wife for her birthday. 
She thought it smelled like cat's piss.
Personally however, I rather liked the stuff.
So much so, in fact, that I'm considering getting a cat...
Overall rating 9/10 (Not my wife's opinion) I dont have limitation on fragrance and I used both perfumes & colognes. Normally I will balance my perfume & cologne collection. Example, if I don't have enough collection for fresh perfumes for women, I will start doing research on any best fresh perfume for women available so that I would have more option if im in the mood for something freshy. 
Recently I purchased Chance Edp Chanel, thinking that it might be the best alternative fresh perfume for women. It is a great perfume I must said. But Chance Edp is not that really fresh, and instead it turns into really powdery & warm on the base notes and not fresh enough for my expectation. 
The only best fresh perfume I have in my collection is Still J.Lo, it's a staple fresh perfume I always have in my collection and entering my 3rd bottles now. 
But then I found this, Yess !!! This really excites me. Its true, some other reviews mention that this is the perfume that u wouldnt like instantly and requires few times wearing and then you realize it's already got into you. 
It's fresh,sweet, and owh the earthy aspects really turns this perfume really elegant. Love it !!! Longevity & projection is pretty decent to me. 
This is so far my best women fresh perfume alongside my long favorite fresh women perfume Still By J.Lo. This stuff is good. I have tried it in hot weathers of middle east where the humidity can be higher than 80% and this baby rocks. I feel in love of this frangrance. it is so different and fresh andinteresting (in a good way). it makes an excellent day time fragrance. pity that is not lasting much on skin. interesting smell..great stuff.. It's a fantastic
one of my most complimented fragrances when I wear it..
it does not dislike!
سمپل ارجینال جهت تست موجود است Extremely fresh opening, and that's a good thing. Orange, a sweet mango and a grapefruit lingering in the background. Yes, beautiful. Then a green note and, wait, it's the carrot! brings the whole composition together.
I've never been in Egypt or Sudan but I love to dream that I'm on a boat with the bright sun on a blue sky and the air is filled with this scents. I know, the reality is different but Thats the magic of scents. They can take you to a far away land were you have never been before.
Un jardin Sur le Nil is delicate, juicy, quiet, understated and wonderful.
It starts with fleshy, juicy elements and finish with dry, herbaceous notes. The ride is over, time to go back to reality. This reminds in no way of Egypt, or the Nile. On me all it does is a sickly sour note. Totally unpleasant. And it doesn't last very long either, which in this case was such a good thing! 
I wanted to try all in the jardin series coz I was so excited after un jardin apres la mousson. I remember being torn between this one and jardin aur le mediterrain. Now I wish I had bought that one :(. I put Un Jardin Sur Le Nil on, and I am instantly transported to a picnic on a warm day. On the checkered table lay a feast of Chicago dogs, pasta salad with vinegar dressing, and a large pitcher of homemade V8 (for the moms trying to hide the carrot juice in the tomato juice.) 
Somethings missing from the tablescape, so the empty jar from the pickled peppers is filled with sharply scented flowers and placed on the table. Perfect! Too bad you forgot to rinse the jar. The picnic is quickly devoured, leaving you to wonder what just happened I just blind ordered this based on the notes and the quality of Hermes! I will update this review when it arrives - I'm very excited! 4/10 This opens with a big grapefruit, which is sustained for 2-3 hours. It has the recognisable ""Hermes"" olfactory stamp; to my mind, a distinctive citrus aldehyde. 
The iris is detectable after a few minutes and although I can't detect a wide palate of base notes, it does dry down to a very pleasant, sweet, balsam. (This is the Eau de Toilette - I'd expect the parfum to be much more complex and interesting.)
Overall: very easy to wear, fresh, well-balanced and recognisably Hermes. The most natural opening I have ever came across. Master Ellena!"
3,Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005," Incredible, amazing, a total must have ! I get compliments every time and I love smelling this on myself. Dirty, nasty. I dont know how else to describe this hay beauty. There is something damp earthy dirty in it, that I gravitate to. 10/10 Uncle Serge! This Smells like A Candle MAN!
I Mean i had a massive thing for tobacco fragrances few years ago! When i tried this, i was like is this a Candle?
This is such a linear fragrance man! It goes nowhere! Its like a Reisinous christmas Candle.
I Respect the people that love this and im not here to start beefin! 5/10! So glad I only got a decant of this. This smells like lightly spiced baby powder (or those wet wipes that clog the plumbing?) on my skin. The SL house must just not be for me. Stupid skin chemistry...Off to pout. For me this is another disappointment by this house! 
Notes are promising but the scent did not work for me at all. 
I find it overly sweet and cloying honeyed tobacco.
I don't get what everyone else is talking about, overrated frag in my opinion.
Serge Lutens creations are just not for me, way too challenging, way too bizarre, to the point where it becomes unwearable, unenjoyable. Oh, dear. Wanted to love this (those notes are everything I adore!) but unfortunately, I don’t think it agrees with my chemistry. This was so fusty and old ladyish on me :( 
The dry down is lovely (though very, very quiet) now, several hours on — cozy wood, chai spice, and amber. But the initial two hours were simply a cloud of outdated powder and spice, and by the time that had passed, easily 70% of the fragrance was gone.
Hope it pulls better on your skin — and with such wide acclaim, there’s no reason to expect it shouldn’t. Chergui is one of the best dry down that I've ever smell. Spicy dry tobacco mix with hey in opening and dry down is very seductive. Nice blended sweet amber rose and tobacco mixed together almost perfect. This is one my cup of tea.
Scent : 4.5/5
Longevity : 4/5
Projection : 4/5 I’m so sad. I have a 5ml decant from a friends full bottle... this smells nothing like everyone is raving about on my skin. I could cry... I get a soapy, powdery bleh... I want the Halloween hay ride near the honey bee farm and campfires and a fancy suede jacket (as mentioned below)! 
I’ll try again tomorrow...
Edit: 4/21- the opening is beautiful. The drydown is still too powdery for me. I definitely should not have sprayed this on myself on a hot sunny day; this is not the mood! I want to revisit this scent when it's cooler though. I mainly get sweet unburnt tobacco and sweet unburnt pontifical incense resins. It's the scent of unburnt things-to-be-burnt? Very cozy. Gave me this sort of spiritual experience the first time I smelled my wrist. Reminded me of all those money I have wasted on too many bottles while missing the one that I shouldn't have. Christopher Sheldrake's line for Serge Lutens seems to be an object of fascination for fragrance enthusiasts because they are so unapologetically ""perfumey""--almost nothing of his I've smelled would be anything you'd want to wear for the office because they are so intense. This is one of his famous scents: a smooth mixture of tobacco, hay, and honey, mixed with iris, that somehow comes off smelling wonderfully like cherry cordial. 
Its sillage is not powerful, which is a good thing, because otherwise it would be much too much (like Baccarat 450, which is slightly resembles, though this is not nearly as cloying). Instead, this is like a nice secret that stays close to the skin, and would probably be much treasured in an intimate relationship by a partner. Like all Lutens fragrances I've smelled, it does require confidence to pull it off because of its boldness. RESTING IN HAY WITH YOUR LOVER - 
ON A SUMMER'S DAY - CIRCRA 1800's FRANCE 
Seductive smooth honey butter - 
Chergui is personal this is not a crown pleaser, at least not for me - I wear this for myself - it's intimate it's romantic it's magical it's seductive. Ok - hear me out. 
The night before, on a warmer October evening/night, you spent the night at a haunted hay ride, close by to a honey bee farm. You were wearing your favourite suede jacket. You come home, not noticing your jacket smells lightly like smoke, hay, honey, a gentle warmth. 
The next day, you put the jacket back on, you step outside. Big inhale. You're hit with the first morning where you can see your breath of the year, mixed with the coolness of frost on the dying grass. 
BAM - you've met Chergui. This starts off with a cool smoky tobacco warmth mixed with hay/dead cold grass. Then, it heats up on the skin, out comes the honey and ambery notes. On the dry down, I get the slightest bit of floral (rose and iris) that smells like the perfume you were wearing the night before that is on its last hour. 
This is gorgeous - absolutely unisex and very layered. 
Longevity is moderate for me 5-6 hours on the skin, lasts forever on clothing. I really like spraying this on warm sweaters or blankets to cuddle up with on a cold night. Silage is moderate, arm's length but still nice. 
Overall 8/10, not a scent I reach for all the time but when I'm in the mood for this, this is all I wear. It's extremely well blended, rounded and smooth. Reminds me to The Dreamer, which I also like a lot, but Chergui is so much smoother. I mostly get the tobacco and hay, with a bit of powder given by the iris and sandal, but everything is there, blended to deliciousness, the honey and amber adds just enough sweetness to balance it out to perfection. So smooth, nothing sticks out. Mysterious, addictive, mesmerizing....magical. 
Mind you, I am not a fan of overly sweet perfumes.... but Chergui seduces you. 
Honey, tobacco (but very mild) a fresh sauge, juniper and other balsamic resins; leather.... give way to a majestc moroccoan rose and iris. Spices and mystery. 
All the above sits onto an ambery/incense/clean musk base. 
Very seducing. Stays with you and comforts you all day (or night) long, like cashmere pullover.
Like the hot oriental wind it borrows the name from (and oriental winds can be very *hot*), it can drag you into paths you'd never thought about. Dangerous! 
A must have; one of my top five fragrances for life. I'm somewhat compelled to add this to my collection because artistically it's significant. It's perhaps better suited to the types of events where you'll spend a fair amount of time with someone, because impressionistically it's not as impressive to me. I'm on the fence as far as immediacy, and intrigued by its evolution. A bit floral, hay-like, honey sweetened, tart tabacco. I would probably prefer a decant, because I dont see myself wearing this very often, but I do see myself appreciating it for the right event. 8/10 Picked up a sample of this and threw it on right before I walked my dogs on a beautiful 70°F Los Angeles day. Opened up a little to my surprise, almost reminding me of ADP Colonia Oud, but that could just be my sniffer playing tricks on me. As I walked, it starting quickly drying down into a delicious, honey tobacco as the listed notes would suggest ... but there’s depth to it. I get just a bit of baby powder on opening, but it burns off pretty quickly and then it’s hardly a powdery scent. It’s quite enjoyable and perfectly unisex with wafts lifting nicely off my skin and floating up to my nose all along my walk. As very, very nice as this is, I won’t be picking it up for myself, but if it were gifted to me I’d be thrilled to add it to the gang. I will say this: as I mentioned, I tried this on a lightly warm day and I think it excelled; it was never cloying or offensive even as I worked up a minor sweat. Wouldn’t recommend it for summer, but I actually really like this for springtime and of course it would shine in fall & winter. Great fragrance. 8.5/10
Edit: As this wears on, I continue to get the most warm and pleasant aroma filled breezes. It’s really making a compelling case for me to pick up a bottle.
Edit again 3/9/21: Just received full bottle as I couldn’t resist. The powder seems to hang around longer than I remember from my sample, but it’s none less fantastic. 
Last edit, I swear: I'm obsessed. There’s an overtly synthetic hot rubber note in here that stands out above all else - it's quite stressful. Like waiting at the car hire garage straight off the plane, in a borderline unbearable foreign heat, thirsty and slightly disoriented...Interesting, but not for me. Quite wearable for a more interesting kind of scent. The ""green"" note stands out to me the most, though it's quite warm and spicy instead of fresh and clean, but still not too heavy if that makes sense. I have to say though, it does vaguely remind me of some type of male-marketed hygiene products (deodorant, shaving cream, etc.) so for that reason alone, I'm not crazy about it. But if you like that type of scent, this one is solid. I love this. I was looking for an elegant tobacco with unisex sweetness and this is my favorite so far. I will admit to liking Tobacco Vanille, and the knock off from Zara, and I liked Tabac rouge (didn't love) - but Chergui is superior to all. It wears much better on me. I didn't like Spicebomb, Havane or 1821 tobacco scents - that's to give you an idea where I am coming from. So when I smelled Chergui, and smelled again it after an hour or so of wearing - I was in love. It goes on perfectly, dries down perfectly. 
I got a sample, and now I will buy a bottle.
More unisex than TV, and more interesting and complex smelling too. There is a sweet tobacco, not too much honey, no leather, some vanilla, and something else interesting and perhaps floral? Just a tiny bit. It works. 
Totally worth it.
It also makes me want to try a Serge Luten's discovery set if they have one. Love love! I get a really nice sweet cherry tobacco with this. It's blended so well with the amber, it almost gives everything a rounded powdery edge. Very nice opening in this, I was afraid the hay note would take over, but it sits in the bottom very nicely.
Rich, dark, and quite thick this one is. Definitely one for the cooler months, but I'm not sure I have any room for another tobacco scent in my little collection. This one leans a little feminine on my skin as well due to the powderiness.
This is my first experience with the house and I am surprised how much I enjoy this one. Somehow it kind of reminds me of a cherry almond lotion but has depth to it. The first comment a loved one made about this, apart from ''Mmmmm'', was that it was ''warm''. It's not an understatement; when I wear this you can actually feel the heat radiating from my wrist. Chergui is a moderately heavy, warm and sweet spicy amber with incense and very mild tobacco & cinnamon notes. This is a classy, perfectly blended, grown-up, intelligent winter perfume and while it is mature and feminine, this could easily be unisex. Takes me away to somewhere deep, dark & interesting in a small tucked away place in Cuba. A very good fragrance that is different to mass market ones and despite its heavy sillage and incredible longevity it is never cloying. A little goes a long way; I have the ''dab on'' bottle not a spray, which is far better for this perfume. Obsession for grown ups. sweet powdery-ambery tobacco with some of the same dna as ""un bois vanille"" also by SL 
they took the best parts of ubv & it's all perfectly balanced in this 
Chergui is niche ""bougie"" fun, cozy, yummy, easy to wear, & a compliment getter 
good projection & longevity
strong like It’s a beautiful scent but it’s been reformulated so badly that you can’t even smell it after 15mins and it doesn’t project at all. If anyone has an old bottle for sale before the reformulation, pm me. I’d at least love to buy a sample. -Chergui opens with a mildly spicy note.
-Initially reminiscent of aftershave. Old spice, perhaps?
-Dries down to reveal a sweet tobacco note.
-This brings to mind a warm mug of cinnamon beverage on an autumn's day.
-Beautiful scent. However, not what I'd wanna smell like living in a hot climate.
-Not fbw for me. (-)
-Recc: do check out Xerjoff- Naxos, if you're in the market for a sweet tobacco fragrance. I got a 2ml sample,sprayed it on few hours ago. First whiff and it was instant love. What a unique masterpiece. Very difficult to describe it, besides other people have said it.
In a nutshell:
Warm and Sweet with a hint of tobacco. I get honey,but don't see honey as a note. 
I'd say quite masculine. 
Age: 25+
Occasions: anything formal.
Sillage is excellent. 
Longivity could be better,but no complaints.
As I was writing, I just got a compliment from a mature lady. 
If it had a tiny bit of more twist to the scent, I'd say 10/10 .
Definitely worthy of trying it.
I will order a full bottle without a doubt. Love how long this lasts first off,yet its not for me to wear on myself,i blind bought based off notes,i think in the winter only it be a great candle in a mans room lol....sorry to any fans of this masterpiece,because i admit i love the scent when smelling it,it reminds me of pine cones in a good way...not in a cheap way,i can smell other notes,it reminds me of a peaceful winter night during holidays,calming,yet strong very nice blend..notes...just not my cup of tea..maybe okay on a man,idk...my loves on a man tho are versace man& yves saint laurent l'homme. Je l avais essayer il y’a longtemps ne n’avez pas aimé je l’ai réessayé quelques moi plus tard sur la main je suis sorti de la boutique et là j’ai senti ce chef-d’œuvre magnifique une odeur de tabac miellé de foin de fraises confit d iris j’ai vraiment adoré 10/10 Very smooth. It smells good as far as smelling things go, and it smells like a high quality fragrance.
It definitely leans more feminine because of how sugary/sweet it is. I don't wear it much. I was hoping for more tobacco.
I wouldn't want my wife to wear it either because it would be a stuffy old lady scent on a woman in my opinion.
Buy a sample and test it. I think it's a stretch for a man or a woman to wear. Again, it DOES smell good, but not as a personal scent. Maybe a winter/cozy candle scent? This is an ambery, sweet tobacco fragrance. I also get whiffs of sandalwood in the background. On the whole, quite nice and smoothly blended. Way better than other boozy ambers such as Roja Dove Amber (Genre Cure), Initio Side-effect (Genre Pendulum), By Killian Back to Black (Dua Honey Laced Tabac). Hermes Ambre Narguile (Dua Amberlicious) is a tiny bit different: perhaps it has a hint of cinnamon?
On the whole, nothing avant-garde or breathtaking, but a very nice fragrance nonetheless. Very nice scent, absolutely a sensual scent. Some say to not blind buy, but I say go for it. Sprayer & cap are a bit sh*t though. Performance is above average, 9-ish hours. Again, this is a very pleasent scent whom I can't see anyone getting offended by, I recommend 100%. Chergui’s core notes are dark tobacco; dense, sticky honey; and funky, plant-ish hay. It's cozy and rich, yet a little rakish, too.
There’s a kind of duality to Chergui: The tobacco and incense pull dark, dry, and serious, while the honey and hay have a sweet, vital, almost chewy moistness to them.
About two-thirds of Chergui is springy and sweetly mentholated, and makes me think of a rural middle-school kid on their first day of vacation, happy and energetic, at play in the field near the barn. But there’s another aspect of Chergui that’s darker, and a bit smoldering: a restless farm-hand working on a pack of chewing tobacco and playing solitaire late into the night. He’s got a copy of Leaves Of Grass in his rucksack with his high school sweetheart’s picture tucked in the pages.
(Despite the image I'm painting, Chergui is more unisex than you would think. I find it beautifully tomboyish on myself, and wear it with relish.) This is a beautiful hay tobacco perfume. Masculine-leaning to my nose. Suitable for most occasions. Masterpiece😍 
Elegant, smoky, spicy, lasts pretty long. 
Weak in sillage so dont be afraid overspray it. 
Reminds me a bit of Dior Addict mixed with Tobacco Vanille, it is that good. This was a blind buy for me because I couldn't find it locally and covid. I was nervous because I read of it smelling of baby powder. I got that vibe but only for about 5 minutes so the haters definitely did not wear this perfume more than 5 minutes. It very quickly fades to something more smoky and sensual yet soft as it simply melts into your skin. There are so many poetic reviews because of the complexity of the fragrance. It's ""not too"" anything which makes it hard to place - not too sweet, not too tobacco, not too honey like, not too spicy, not too feminine, not too masculine, etc. The poetic experience for me personally is that Chergui brought me to sitting by a campfire. It's as if campfire scent is mixing with a fresh clean soapy smell and there is raw honeycomb nearby. By the time the perfume reaches the base notes I can't describe it as anything other than it smells like a nice warm hug LOL! For years I've worn Coco Madamoiselle and was more than ready for a change. At the very least I found a new winter/fall fragrance. I'm so glad I bought it and tried something new! this is coming from a moroccan, the opening does have a similarity to the smell/aroma of Chergui, it brings me to mid July-August, Noon and its +40°C, but it disappears after a couple of minutes when the amber & honey rise to the top and are prominent.
only trying this from a decant, but i would definitely buy this, very beautiful, not offensive, well balanced.
i love how from time to time i get a whiff of isolated honey, amber or a light tobacco. I really love Chergui, it is really more than just a tobacco scent. The tobacco here is a raw one, and combined with hay, it creates a very unique feel, as if we are in a tobacco plant field. Honey and amber adding sweetness to the concoction, just about enough to bring this perfume from the masculine territory to the unisex realm. 
I can't stop sniffing my wrists wearing this hahahaha.... It projects moderately with good longevity. De Marly's Herod might be a better option than Chergui if you are looking for a heavy tobacco scented fragrance. Chergui is not so much about the tobacco, but the mix of the tobacco, hay, amber, and honey. Dusita Issara has the same vibe as Chergui, but both equally beautiful. My dad in the 70s smoking a pipe on the porch, lovely early autumn evening, sticky golden apples on the ground covered in yellow jackets, on my grandfather’s farm. Thank goodness for the sweetness so that I can wear it- am so glad it isn’t all dry tobacco. Lovely! I love the opening, it smells so enveloping and powdery. But when it dries down, I mainly get a strong piercing spicy note. Slightly mature. I personally wouldn't wear this but I think it smells great overall. It's mainly an iris and amber fragrance, I don't get any tobacco, even though Chergui keep getting referred to as a tobacco-based fragrance. It's Gorgeous! My batch is from February 2020. Upon initial spray, it instantly reminded me of Bvlgari Black, which I also own. It doesn't have its tea notes, but it has that plasticky-rubbery smell; it could be a flanker for Bvlgari Black. The DNA in the opening is very similar. 
Chergui is a nice smell. It has other notes blended in, and yes, it's blended masterfully, with nothing clashing or sticking out, but overall, my brain detects the scent of baby wipes at first. I used to own Black is Black Modern Oud, and it also had that baby wipe-like smell. 
After 20-30 minutes, Chergui starts smelling leathery like Ferrari Uomo, which I own, and also reminding me of the new leather notes of...more oud fragrances again...Ferrari Essence Oud, which I used to own. It also has a similar rose note to the one in Franck Olivier Oud Touch and also Perry Ellis Black Vanilla Absolute.
Just two sprays on my skin project nicely and get stronger by the minute. It's not a fragrance bomb, but for being such a delicate, smooth and harmless fragrance, people will definitely notice this scent in your personal bubble. It's not perfumey or cologney like your typical department store fragrances, so it's in my opinion very safe to use anywhere.
If you're super picky or not too adventurous, do get a sample first before you buy a full bottle, because ir's not cheap, and I can see someone not being super thrilled about it. It warrants careful olfactory exploration. Give it a chance if you do buy it. I wasn't thrilled by it at first, but the more I sniffed it on me, the more I got why people fall so deeply in love with it. It's just a classy, cozy fragrance.
If Chergui was a human, to me it would be a reassuring brain or heart surgeon, or a courageous firefighter or EMT. ☺️
God bless! 🙏 Stunning. Great tobacco scent, really good stuff :) I find it strange every time I hear Chergui referred to as a tobacco fragrance. Sure, it has tobacco in it. It has Iris in it and warm sun-sweetened hay, as well. It’s dusty and sweet, sun-scorched but cooling, like a cold breeze through the middle of a desert. Once you know the combination, all the notes balancing harmoniously in a cloud around you, it only smells like one thing: Chergui. 
If you’re looking for a straight tobacco scent, there are more realistic choices: dirty tobacco and sweet tobacco and spiced tobacco. Slumberhouse and Hiram Green and Ensar Oud and Sultan Pasha all do better Tobacco scents. No one does a better Chergui. 
Classic for a reason. stunning perfume! stunning stunning stunning stunning stunning stunning stunning! and it is suitable for anybody, a baby girl, her loving uncle or her great-grandmother. Chergui. Nondescript saccharine powderiness. A general sweet ""perfume"" smell. But it's color is a good match because I do get a plummy ""tobacco""-esque sweetness off it.
Takes a seat at my personal anti-Pantheon of scents that never struck me with nearly the specialness that their reputations foretold, despite being among the first niche/upper-end perfumes I smelled. Chergui could possibly be my anti-Hera. (Sitting next to Aventus, the anti-Zeus.)
But all this said with, yknow, proper respect ;P Second review on this:
I have had a lot of time with this and my impressions of the fragrance have not really changed in the sense I think its a wonderful fragrance that smells warm and comforting with great longevity and I do love it. 
However, after trying a few other tobacco frags such as Naxos, Pure Havanne, Tobacco Reserve Aramis and recently Volutes Diptyque EDP, I find that the tobacco accord in this is far too weak for me. Personally I prefer a more masculine gentlemen like tobacco scent with the right balance of sweetness so I do now prefer Tobacco Reserve and Volutes and if I had the spare coin I would buy Naxos, just my personal preference thats all. 
Chergui has a lot going on with it the start is rather intense and in the dry down I do find it rather sweet with that honey and powdery iris, but if you're after a sweet tobacco scent thats not too full on in your face e.g. Pure Havanne or Tobacco Vanille, than I would definitely recommend this! it is far more interesting and unique than the latter two. Lucky I got a decant before a full bottle!
This really is gorgeous but definitely not for a feminine woman like me in my opinion which is sad because I really wanted to like it as I love a sweet tobacco (tobacco vanille from TF😍) Welcome to the holy grail in the frag-community, as far as tobaccoscents go. 
You can not take it any further than this. Serge Lutens Chergui is a truly fine work of art, i must say. Yes, you have read all the reviews before, there is little i can add. But let me state this:
The opening is heavy on tobacco, the dry down is tobacco/amber/hay. It´s all blended into something universal, something you will keep close to yourself for the rest of your life, once you have smelled it. 
Tobacco, to me, is leaning more masculine than the opposite. That doesn´t mean that a woman should not wear this scent, not at all. But the tobacco-note is a hard hitter and you need to appreciate that, be aware. There is no escape in this frag! 
One more thing: I strongly advice you to get your hands on one of the (discontinued) old 50 ml bottles. They are so much more fashion than the new bottles. The juice might be the same - the fashion is not. 
But in the end. You know the cliché: If you only should try one tobacco-frag....this is the one. 
Projection: moderate. 
Longivety: 6 hours.
Instagram: @a_fraghags_tale The first time I smelled this, it reached right into my chest to a very emotional place, like it was twanging my heartstrings. Prodding at something familiar and old, something deeply formative but totally unplaceable. I've only experienced this deep-but-unidentifiable nostalgia response to perfume a couple of times. 
Aside from that, it's also just a beautiful and delicious fragrance. Smooth, sweet, delicate, strong, present, perfect. It's well-balanced, well-blended, and simply gorgeous. 
Chergui is so compelling and deeply libidinal, it's almost unnerving. I'm so glad I found it. The hype is real. The opening is to me a minty hay absolute bomb mixed with sweet honey. It's weirdly minty to my nose, and the opening reminds me of a kid's sweet mint toothpaste I used to use when I was maybe 5 years old!
After a while the mint-like notes settles down and I instead get some rose and a lot of great dry pipe tobacco, a smell I love. Unfortunately, this amazing scent is buried underneath a very sweet honey accord that gives me a headache and an amber that I'm not a big fan of either... I wanted this to be a dry, dark tobacco but instead it's a sugary sweet powdery tobacco (like a lot of tobacco scents nowadays unfortunately are).
Definitely not for me but for the people who love honey & tobacco combos and want something a bit more interesting than the usual stuff, this is for you.
(That color of the liquid is BEAUTIFUL though!) I'm no expert, but there are few fragrances I've ever tried that I would consider to be a work of art. This is one of them. I would say that I couldn't ever really see myself wearing this, but there are few fragrances that so vividly invoke a certain scene or mood. ""By the Fireplace"" is a great example, and you can guess why. ""Vetiver"" by Guerlain is another good one personally, because it reminds me of when my dad would drag me along to his tennis matches when I was a kid. Tennis balls, sweat, and white t-shirts.
This fragrance drags me to a wheat field in autumn, next to a big dilapidated barn. It hits you with a very dry, warm 'hay' accord, which eventually dies down into a slightly sweet, smooth and warm honey tobacco. It's an incredible scent, one that I definitely wouldn't mind at all as a candle, but definitely not one I can wear. Most definitely worth a try. I love this fragrance it is a piece of art. Lucky me i found an original bottle for a very good price since i do not like the look of the newer bottles from the house One of the finest honey and tobacco combination ever tried. Performance is great with 10 + hours. Christ all mighty this is good! 
I have been meaning to test it for a while and I finally got around to it as it is certainly not on the hype train. 
It has literally blown me away and I cannot understand why more people do not rave about this on their Autumn/ fall winter rotation this year. 
I must admit it does smell rather different on skin than paper which is probably why the rating is not as high as I thought it would be. But my lord what a fragrance! 
My rotation will be, Dior Homme Intense, Rochas Moustache, l'Instant de Guerlain Pour Homme EDP, this is Him Zadig and Voltaire, Encre Noir A l' extreme and of course Chergi! 
The only downside of this fragrance for some people is, it is not that versatile. But if you are smelling this chances are you have collection of fragrances already for every occasion! Just enjoy it :)
Edit: Actually on second thoughts I find this versatile I could wear this for most occasions, its not a date night scent as it does not project enough. But it is just perfect for a cold day and makes you feel all warm inside every-time you sniff it. Oh...wow. I put two dabs on each wrist and immediately heard Jim Morrison crooning in my head. (""Well, show me the way, to the next whiskey bar...."") I looked at my Doc Martens moto boots in the corner...not the black ones, the brown ones...and wanted to put them on with the dark brown riding jacket from Westley Richards that my beloved Mate surprised me with a few years ago. Timeless. Classic. This is a perfect companion for walking in the chill of Fall. For going to a high-end whiskey bar, one that has a giant stone fireplace with the fire going steadily because it is cold outside. Chergui would be at home sitting at that fireplace, watching the firelight play over a snifter of high-end bourbon, smelling the tobacco of an expensive cigar or pipe to the left of you, while to your right you can faintly overhear Sherlock Holmes and John Watson arguing about something. For me, so far, Chergui evokes more of a feeling and conjures images that are more than the sum of its notes. Yes, I can smell the tobacco, the sweetness that I assume is honey (but is so well-blended it doesn't smell like any honey I've ever smelled in a perfume), the smokey note that drifts under the tobacco and sweetness, and the fleeting powdery-ness that drifts past occasionally, almost like someone opened the door and a faint bit of the cold outside made its way to the fireplace. I understand now why this is one of SL's most beloved and well-known fragrances. Beautiful, beautiful scent that was one of my early forays into niche. I love how the cacophonous, spice-laden opening settles into the most beautiful sugared hay atop an amber base. I will always have this in my collection. Yes, it's changed over time. The original bell jar I received of this had a certain three dimensionality, chewiness, and heft to its sweet hay chord. I'd say now it's a bit more vaguely ambery with a whisper of that hay, but still lovely nonetheless, and ultimately produces the same effect. The ""morning after"" Chergui--a lingering breath of coumarin and spice--is my favorite part of the scent and all versions of it from oldest to newest have provided that sensation. It has some greeness that reminds me of pickled veggies. It's not very in your face, but it's there. Otherwise, a spicy tobacco gem for tobacco lovers. Not my cup of tea tbh. A well crafted beautiful soft and powdery scent. The tobacco note is not the main player here as the iris, honey, hay, and soft woods transform this fragrance into something quite unique. The dry down leaves you wanting more! It's classy, sophisticated, and unique. Great for the colder months of the year. Unfortunately, Parfums de Marly Herod continues to be my most favorite tobacco perfume in the world!
My three P's
- Price 8/10
- Projection 8/10
- Performance 8/10 Super strong, like tobacco and burning hay with a tiny drop of honey on top. It's honey alright, but not super sweet to my nose, which is great because ultra-sweet honeys tend to make me sick! I just got a new bottle of this and it's just barely sweet, which is interesting because I sniffed it back in 2018 as well and all I could smell was a very animalic, very sweet honey-oud scent (like pee! and it also oddly reminded me of Oud Bouquet without pralines...) The tobacco is very forward on this one and I think it's being amplified by the hay note.
I like my new bottle, though, it's a real powerhouse and quite bitter on me. Earthy, elegant, but makes a statement. I'll definitely be wearing this in the fall alone or layering it with something sweet and fresh to brighten it up. This makes me smell like a sexy barrel museum and I mean that as a compliment A beautiful oriental-floral symphony conducted by a magnificent pair of rose & iris, getting to be perfumed and delicate without entering dangerous soapy/makeup territory (typically related to such notes), but so exclusively to the purest nature-floral aspect of both. I can't remember such intense flowers marrying so well together in a perfume! They are the absolute stars of the fragrance. The notes-voting of Fragrantica are extremely illusive in this one, as tobacco and honey are only here to assist the star pair and give the fragrance its oriental character (SL dna), also laying a sweet but light and smooth background that in no way tries to ""steal the spotlight"" of the aforementioned stellar duo. I feel clear, in third place in prominence, the very lively and natural green freshness of the very interesting and different hay. To top it off, all the aroma is heavily greased by amber along with a silky and slightly animalic but subtle musk. Performance: projects nicely for 2hs or so, sitting close to skin for just another 3hs or so - not very good longevity. Iris is sort of the centerpiece, but not in the beginning. In the first 15 minutes you might think, ""wow, did someone pop some pastries in the oven? Heavenly!"" When all the notes have settled, though, the mix is floral, earthy and sweet. All in nice proportion. oh my god. This is my perfect tobacco fragrance.
I love it so much I am even wearing it in my room in the summer. 
Elegant, refined, not obnoxious, understated, sexy, sweet, smokey, well blended....and the list goes on.
I think of this as unisex- if my boyfriend wore this I would feel tingles immediately but I also wear it and LOVE it so much. 
I hate screaming perfumes- this is more of a skin scent on me. This is smokey-sweet intimacy and elegance in a bottle. This is a outstanding fragrance. It is a tobacco honey scent that is very smooth with none of the notes jumping at you, they all blend into each other. I do pick up on the hay note which adds to the overall smoothness. The opening to my nose smells like wood polish and has a potpourri vibe to it which makes it very much unisex in my opinion but the drydown to me is superb.
The performance is very good for a fragrance with a soft scent profile. Absolutely exquisite, masterpiece. 
There is really nothing like it , it wears absolutely beautifully and lasts forever. I always get complimented when I wear this. This is so sweet and jammy with a powdery sillage. It's very hard to pinpoint a single note but together they are fantastic. This is a powdery hay driven iris perfume. If you’re searching for tobacco you won’t find it. If you dig powdery florals this will be right up your alley. Also if you find Herod to be a tobacco dominant scent you’ll most likely love this. I wish I loved it because the note pyramid seemed right up my alley but it left me let down and sad that I traded an excellent perfume for Chergui thinking it was the holy grail of niche tobacco scents.
Edit 
After some consideration I’m wondering if I’m anosmic to whatever Tobacco aromachemical they use in this because I get none of the syrupy, golden honeyed pipe tobacco people keep talking about. It’s dry, not very sweet at all, extremely powdery and mostly more powder. Anyone else experience this? This is absolutely luscious. I am testing it at home in the middle of a heat wave, and it's making me long for the pleasures of fall. Warm, spicy, earthy, comforting, and sweet without veering into cloying, gourmand territory. I am guessing this is a scent aimed at men, but I'd say it's a true unisex scent, especially if your skin tends to draw out sweeter notes the way mine does. Good sillage and staying power. Definitely full-bottle worthy, especially since this is one of the more affordable Lutens offerings. A blind buy that is bittersweet.. and not just the scent. My first reaction was ""aah awesome!"", second was: ""I want a man to wear this!"". Unfortunately I have no one to hose down with this and that is the bitter part. Guess I'll just wear it myself.
Dreamy smooth oriental that does not feel cloying at all. I don't know about hay, but I grew up having horses, so maybe that's why I don't really think this qualifies in that regard ;) Honeyed tobacco with spices sounds more like it. It has that dryness that I like, it's not dripping of honey, it's just there making it cosy rather than sharp.
If you are a man contemplating buying this or any of those aquatic, metallic concoctions, please choose this. I simply think it smells like ‘musc ravageur’ plus ‘geranium pour monsieur’ plus mint chocolate and little bit water sea squirt. Haha In order to deliver that burning hot sweet Sahara wind feeling, in my opinion the Best time to wear Chergui would be outdoors at night, when there is a bit of wind blowing. Doesn't matter if it's summer, fall or winter. This NEEDS some wind to spread the ""Saharan fire"". Every fraghead has a pile of samples, samples of fragrances we bought to try. Some we bought bottles, some we rejected and some we forgot about. Chergui is one that I forgot. I have had a decant for at least 6 years. Today I decided to wear it again.
This is the first time my wife smelled it on me. 3 times this morning she has said that I smell good. So a bottle is now on the way. :) 
Chergui is a beautiful tobacco and honey that is slightly powdery on my skin. I get good projection and longevity.
This one is worth a sample. Initially the fragrance is hot, it's outdoors, it's dirty. I feel like I'm at a farm bailing hay, sun drenched and exasperated. But it retreats, within 15 minutes the honey notes begin wrapping around the picture of hay and dry tobacco. While sweet, it's not diabetic, only complimentary. Ultimately the perfume mellows out into a creamy amber with mild and delicate smoke notes. Like sitting in church after services are over, there lingers something resinous in the air but it's faint and passing. The heat dissipates, it becomes a cool to the touch leather. After 4 hours the hay has muted, the tobacco matured and mutated into the smoke note. I think it's very pleasant, very unisex, and appropriate for any weather. I really want to revisit it when it's warmer outside. Solid 8/10
(still on my wrist 12 hours later) This is such an intriguing fragrance. A friend was wearing this years ago, she smelt incredible - on her it was a mix of rose and honey and I had never sniffed anything like it. I ordered myself a bottle, it's unlike anything else I own and initially can seem a little strange but the drydown is worth it. There is definitely tobacco, a hint of hay and some honey but the tobacco is never too much and thankfully I find that element of it does get muted down once it has been on the skin for a while. For me this is dusky rose, honey, greenery and amber. I think it's a love or hate one for some, I'm definitely in the love camp. If you wear this people will definitely ask what you are wearing as it's such an original scent. Anosmic to the tobacco aroma chemical that they use but to my nose it smells very similar to Bond no.9 New Haarlem. This was jarring to my nose at first, like the rest for this house
I kept sniffing, hated it less and less. I'm now absolutely obsessed. I will never be without this. My favorite tobacco tied with herod from PDM Nothing smells like Chergui ... nothing! I get the hay , tobacco & iris . I goes powdery on me after about 40 minutes. It starts off a bit medicinal... with some sweetness, which has to be the honey . It’s blended well and difficult to pick out individual notes. Overall it’s pretty unique & I enjoy it 👍 Hate the opening but it totally transforms on my skin after about 15 minutes. But the first few minutes on me are totally nauseating. So probably can't provide an objective review. Ignore my previous review- for those who bothered to read.
I intensely disliked this fragrance for the longest time because of a perceived animalic note. But I can say it’s Hay and it’s certainly grown on me. I would say Chergui is a fragrance that matures a persons taste to appreciate things that aren’t necessarily aesthetic or beautiful, but they are interesting. 
Hay is the most apparent note that is wrapped in a dark, resinous honey with a spicy tobacco. I appreciate having Chergui in my collection as it deviates from my abundant gourmands and uber feminine or conservative classics. I still wouldn’t wear it outside even though it does draw curious side glances, I can’t really see an appropriate occasion for it. 
It’s unisex, but veres slightly masculine. Excellent longevity and a powerful sillage. They definitely change the formula because the new version is more smokey than the old one. Personally, I prefer the old version as it has a better balance between the notes of tobacco and honey, which is neither too sweet nor too smokey. As I am a girl, I don't like the scent to be too smokey, which makes it very masculine. Plus the bottle design of the old version is prettier as well. A weird fragrance, there is an opulent opening of a spicy tobacco with a sharp, screeching honey. The texture is dense and heavy. 
There is something weirdly offensive that presents itself in the dry down. It almost has a repulsive effect. I feel as though SL may have hidden an animalic note, as many perfumers do in order to provoke the subject. But he slightly tipped the jar a little too much and it’s just overbearing. Whilst I absolutely adore Chanel Antaeus and Oud Wood intense, this is just straight up gross. 
It veres masculine, mainly due to the array of strong, dominating notes and an absence of sweetness or floral tones. 
This is definitely a more challenging fragrance and I won’t repurchase it. Despite its success online, I have struggled to meet anyone in my family or work group who actually likes it. spicy, sweet, unisex. I just received a new bottle of it and it definitely used to be stronger and 'denser' compared to the old bottle I got, unfortunately. Test on skin before purchase. Another review of this one because it's worth it.
If you're expecting a tobacco-centred perfume then steer away. This is mostly hay, orris root, and honey, based around a vetiver base.
I have few tobacco perfumes (Herod, Volutes, Spicebomb, Fuielles de Tabac, Aramis Havana), and tried others including Mystery Tobacco by Carolina Herrera but I cant associate the tobacco note in Chergui to any of them (because I can't smell tobacco here!) 
Performance is amazing on me, I sprayed yesterday and can still smell on clothes. The drydown is yummy and soft, and I enjoyed all phases of this perfume.
It is unisex and I would happily wear and share with my other half.
Is it full-bottle worthy? It's a yes if you like to smell unique & different. My bottle is running low and I would probably get another one in the future. So this is based on a decant that I got, so I don't know the batch.
Longevity? Excellent - still a skin scent 16 hours after applying.
To my nose Chergui and L'Homme Ideal EDT have the same DNA. Chergui starts with the sweet tobacco, L'Homme Ideal starts with sweet almond. LHI drys down into a leather/tonka bean warmth, while Chergui goes almost to that same scent on me (and I have no idea which notes are actually making that up)
A little bit intense for what I like to wear on a workday, this is a prime one for my weekend rotation. Will definitely be looking at picking up a bottle. I came back to this perfume after not wearing it for a while. It's a great winter fragrance with a mix of warm and sensual notes that had me sniffing my wrists all day. (How do you do that unnoticed?)
My nose gets sweet hay at opening and then amber says ""hello"" at around the thirty minute mark as the scent deepens. This will last me a good 8 hours or more.
I own three Serge Lutens and find all to be high quality and sophisticated. I can't discern why ANYONE would choose Spice Bomb over this. To each their own I guess...
Think of Spice Bomb as your noisy classless neighbor - the one you close the blinds for so you don't have to see them. Or worse, they see you and come over uninvited. Today is my first wearing of this fragrance. I received a 5ml bottle from Luckyscent with a recent purchase, and I am completely blown away by it a few hours in. I had heard of comparisons to Herod, with more people preferring Herod, so I did not seek this one out.
I mostly get tobacco and rose, with an underlying sweetness I am guessing from the hay. I am surprised that I like it as I didn’t think I would like it with the hay note. I used a little bit from the dabber and I am getting wafts of this from my wrist. It’s really beautiful, I’ll grab a full bottle if I see a good price. This smell like a pair of expensive freshly polished leather shoes. I’m completely flabbergasted as there is no leather mentioned in the notes, but what the heck, I often have a problem to detect leather in the actual leather fragrances so why not to have it the other way round for a change:-) It must be the honey and tobacco giving it this waxy quality. At the same time, it is quite powdery and you will keep getting occasional whiffs of vanillic undertones. The sweetness comes from honey and amber, but it is by no means overpowering. I’m big fan of Lutens and Chergui was one of their creations that kept escaping my attention (despite being highly regarded in the frag community). I have to say it lived up to its fame and sits firmly on my wishlist now. I have the latest version (2019 production date) on this fragrance and here is my initial analysis. The tobacco, hay and honey seem to be much more pronounced than I remember when I had an older formulation back in 2011. That one came across as much more powdery. To me, this reminds me of an older gentleman on a homestead, coming home from the hay fields, wearing a tweed jacket and smoking a pipe with honey flavored tobacco. Very warm and sensual. Now onto the performance. I can tell you that the reformulation(s) have not hindered the performance with this in any way whatsoever. Projection is very strong for the first couple of hours but then settles closer to the skin, which is what I think you would want in a fragrance such as this. As far as longevity goes, forget about it. I sprayed 1 spray of this on my hand at 12:30pm yesterday and as of 9:30 am today, it is now just starting to go away. So, at least 21 hours of longevity. If you claim that this fragrance doesn't have good longevity there are only 3 reasons for why that is: 
1. You have a fake
2. You have extremely dry skin
3. You have very unrealistic expectations on how long a fragrance should last and believe that if it doesn't last at least a week on you, that it's not good enough. Today, I went fragrance browsing. I've never heard about Chergui. One of the reps was new, and I was teaching her about all the notes and sniffing the PDM's. Anyway, she was impressed about how I knew all of the fragrance names etc. I asked her if she could make me a decant of Chergui. At this point, we've sniffed about 20 perfumes because she wanted to ask the senior rep a question for me that was busy. She sniffed it from the cap, made me a decant and said WOW! This is the best fragrance I've ever smelled in the entire store. It's very light. Compare to Spice Bomb? Are you out of your mind? I have the first batch, and that synthetic smelling trash isn't even in the same ball park. Now, I'll admit Spice Bomb projects, but Chergui is a much more pleasing scent. Subjectivity and opinions is what makes fragrances so great. No doubt this is a pleasant fragrance if you enjoy the sweet powdery tobacco genre.
For me, this is dominated by amber and tonka (hay) and iris...giving off an extremely pleasant sweet powdery vibe. The tobacco is only in the background to add complexity and depth. This is indeed a very sexy unisex DNA.
Longevity and projection are slightly above average for me.
No doubt I recommend getting a sample and checking this out. My issue is it’s a bit redundant to a number of fragrance I already own (i.e. MFK Grand Soir, D&G The One EDP, etc. etc.). This is definitely a fragrance that you have to allow to dry down on your skin to judge. It evolves from the initial spray, and I think that it would be fair to say that it's going to pull something a little different based on your chemistry. It definitely is far softer, and closer to the skin than I thought it would be. But, that isn't necessarily a bad thing, either. 
The initial spray is almost entirely dominated by the hay. And, there's a somewhat medicinal note that smells similar to cherry cough syrup, but drier. I know that some people say that there is a cherry note to this scent, and I think the camphorous nature of the wood is why it seems medicinal. This dries down to a somewhat sweet, creamy sandalwood scent on my skin. I don't retain the florals, though I did detect them as I wore the scent. Overall, I really like this scent. It makes me sad that it doesn't appear to have much longevity on my skin (probably a unique problem) because it is rather delightful. 
As I sit sniffing my wrists, I would say that this scent reminds me of Maroussia (I posted it above). And, I wouldn't say that they're close enough to be a dupe, but they share enough notes in common that they have a similar feel to them. They wear about the same, and I wonder if the same trick I use to get Maroussia to last on my skin will work with Chergui (fingers crossed). I believe that if you like one you will enjoy the other, and they have a passing resemblance. I blind bought a sample and i love it. I can detect tobacco from start to finish, it has this sweet and spiciness vibe, IMO. I know lots of people not gonna like it, but it's ok. I know that: when you spray a perfume you gotta ALWAYS let it sink into your skin, and wait a couple of minutes until it develops and that's when you will appreciate the aroma. I know there are lots of perfumes out there that smell TERRIBLE at first spray, but when you give them some time to sit, you'll surprise and will appreciate. I ❤ the dry down, i found myself sniffing my wrist every minute, 😊😊. Give it a try.
Fragrance notes: tobacco leaf, honey, iris, sandalwood, amber, musk, incense, rose and hay. Someone sent me a tester of this. It smells really nice and strong. A man can wear this, but a strong woman with exquisite taste will enjoy having this one.
12/28/19 - This came in the mail today, my goodness I cannot stop smelling my arm. I am in-love with this fragrance, it is like nothing I have in my wardrobe. I purchased the 50 mil bottle; I should have purchased the larger bottle. I want to tell SL to take my money already, I will definitely look into the others. Ahhh Chergui what happened? 
I had a sample, in a small atomizer. Dark, dense, thick honey and hay, it would transfer to anything in my bag, sunglasses, pens, papers. It was tenacious. I wasn’t a huge fan, I enjoyed it, but more out of curiosity. The dusty honey hay accord, drew me in, but it always let me feeling flat, as it was a dense thick fragrance. 
Then I ran out. 
Then I got a new sample
Now it appears it is Aqua Chergui. What was once dense thick honey hay, opens with a light transparent sweet mist, and settles into something resembling Chergui. Not as tenacious as my first introduction to Chergui, not as interesting either. To me, it comes across as super synthetic, i.e. plastic-smelling. I know a lot of people like this fragrance, but I don't. I wouldn't recommend blind buying this one. Country Club Lounge...
This is a warm slightly sweet Oriental, tobacco leaves on a amber and dray hay bed with a touch of sandalwood.
To me this smells like entering in a refine high-society country club, during a cloudy evening fall. You've been outside and its getting cold, and then you enter inside and this warm comforting feeling is what you get when you spray this on.
Downside here to me is its performance. I like bold, rich, long-lasting fragrances and this one, from a recent purchase, it is not. I can imagine this has gone through a number of reformulations, but now it is what it is, a beautiful cozy skin scent. (at least in my skin... so you should try, and get your own conclusions)
Uniqueness: medium
Scent: 7.5
Performance: average
Would I buy it: No (it is in my collection for the high number of references out there to this perfume) Tobacco and incense in sweet union on a dry grassy bed of honeyed florals. Got 40 mls for 50 pounds on ebay. Lucky me!
This is perfume perfection of a certain order. So powerfully soft. Like being pelted by a soft fragrance-infused leather whip..
Its superb and so much better after 30 mins. There is too much natural deep depth in this mix to inhale in such concentration. I think that might induce a headache and why some say this is headache inducing- this is full of ingredients that can have a narcotic effect if sniffed while damp.
So complex its not good for me at least,to breath the opening in. When I let it sink into my skin, it morphs into a soft leathery soothingly sweet blanket of animalic grace. A comfort scent perfect for cooler weather. Sexy too especially when it hits the powdery drydown, but not soft, sexy is the word. I love it and its special for special moments.
My 40 mls will last for years. Sublime mix.Just. Get. It. vanilla harsh chemical synthetic smell like a cleaner maybe some rotten leather and CINNAMON and hated it when I wore it in the winter though it seems like a winter fragrance; was about to sell it and decided to try it one last time before selling in the summer and loved it as it blooms as a leather scent The opening is kinda headache inducing for me yet I keep putting my nose it? It’s powerful and addicting ... wait for it to calm its damn self down and it’s pretty impressive ! Think Dior Fahrenheit mixed with YSL Kouros mixed with TF tobacco oud ! IMO 🤗 Really spicy tobacco! At first I didn't get much tobacco, but some sort of spicy oriental sweet something. But after some time the tobacco comes in and takes over! And it is so realistic! Love it! Dry, very powdery, not sweet enough. I do love me a good spicy fragrance, but this is spicy like a curry. Too savoury for me I'm afraid. Sensual confidence
Enchanting honeyed tobacco and hay. Sometimes depending on the weather, you can feel also the dried fruit or traces of the leather and sandalwood in the drydown.
The sweetness may be too intense for hot days, though I have to admit that I use during summer nights, especially if I know/plan how the night will end ;).
Warm, sensual and very very addictive ""french"" oriental. I love it! I think it makes me soooo suave - an interesting and confident mature man someone can easily fall in love with.
5/5 Chergui is one of my all time favourite fragrances. It wasn't always that way, however, as it once smelt like laundry detergent to me. Luckily I decided to go against all natural instinct and give it another go because ... oh, my. This is stunning. Truly beautiful. I'm about to buy a 50mL bottle after yearning for it for almost a year and a half. This is the richest, warmest tobacco scent you will ever smell. Sweetened by the honey and smooth incenses without an ounce of harshness of vulgarity. It is charming and friendly without pretension. The best of the best Serge Lutens and one of the best fragrances of all time. In my honest opinion, of course. A real French fragrance. This fragrance has earned something of a cult following and has, in my opinion, the character, performance (longevity more so than projection) and uniqueness to warrant such. It is unfortunate, therefore, that I personally don't care for this fragrance.
Something in the opening rubs me quite the wrong way, I believe it may be the hay note but the sweetness has a jarring quality. To my mind, in conjures an image of some kind of plant/ insect debris that has died on exposure to the scorched surface of a cattle grid, and started to ooze under the heat of the sun. It is sweet, rich and gum-like, it has an inedible quality, but there is nothing religious or temple-like in the incense used here. It really does have a strong farm-like association to me, but it is not remotely animalic or dirty.
The dry-down is much more tolerable, even pleasant, in my view, being a fairly classical warm sweet incense which lasts as a skin scent for some time. On me, this fragrance lives for about 7 hours, about half of which I'm not enjoying. I do think it sits quite close to the skin. Its massive popularity and the fact that it's different warrant a try from an enthusiast, but be wary of blind purchasing in this instance. Beautiful opening 15 minutes followed by Musk overload for the remainder of the drydown, the Musk is similar to the Musk in Ravageur and unfortunately dominates all the other notes. I barely get any tobacco, honey or iris after the glorious opening.
I have no problem with Musk in general but I was expecting this to be more of a complex tobacco honey scent.
Not hating on it at all, it's a quality fragrance, but my 10ml Atomizer will not be replaced when or if emptied I love this perfume. The best one word description would be ""warm."" There's definitely honey and tobacco and sweetness, and a warm, dry leafy smell that I suppose is the hay note. It can seem a bit aggressive and a bit herbal on first spray but it settles in so nicely and isn't unpleasant at all to those around you. It smells delicious and warm and comforting; very sweet but not in a baked goods way. More like pure honey melted on hot rocks and dried leaves outside in the sunshine. I don't get any powdery scent at all. I also don't notice anything particularly floral - there's a naturalness to it that reminds me of nature, but not in a 'green' or floral way. I would say this is a unisex scent. On my skin, it opens up like Coca-Cola, with a base that's very similar to Fahrenheit le Parfum. Hi guys more of an ask then anything else.... is it worth trying to find an older bottle/batch rather than forking out for the newer plain label/new formula bottle? 
I much prefer louder more potent and now sadly older formulas as the newer reformulated juices leave alot to be desired :(
Any advice would be appreciated and thanks in advance ;)
Ifra = Trash!!! Been wearing this beautiful scent all day. I only have about half my 50ml vintage bottle left, so I tend to use this one sparingly.
Today was a stunning sunny winter's day - cool, crisp air with clear skies and abundant sunshine. 
The climatic conditions seemed to bring out all the rich depth and nuances of this spicy, warm concoction. The honey and hay notes really flourished.
I also wore it to the massage I'd booked. It added a comforting layer to a very relaxing experience.
Chergui is an uplifting tonic of a fragrance and always affects my mood in the best possible way. Chergui is a very powdery amber fragrance. Tender but a bit grey. It's cooling, so I think it would work even in the summer but definitely in fall and winter too. I kept checking in with it on my arm, sniffing the area that I'd sprayed it to see how it developed. I like it, pure and simple, but I'm not sure that I would personally add it to my collection because I find it lacking in something. I want a disruptive note to offset all the delicate smoothness. Fwiw, it's summer now and I sampled a new bottle. Will revisit in autumn. @rgordin- i stand corrected. Tehn by all means i would bet that 11.00 fragrance vs the 70+ dollar one. So many houses are reformulating to make money when i really think already fragrance markup is insane. @smellsbells yes, they both smell a bit old lady in the classic sense. Sprayed one on one wrist, the other on other wrist. Neither I, my husband nor my friend could tell the difference after 15 minutes. Maroussia does in fact have better longevity. Edit: the reformulation in new style bottle is a far cry from the original. A different perfume, with dissonant notes and a strange sourness. All creaminess and depth has gone. The far dry down resembles the original, but is weak and almost watery.
Firstly, in my mind is how to review this complex aroma in a few words?
leather! there is a prominent animalic leather note in the base, which was a surprise! and an unexpected camphorous note too. the initial blast a complete surprise. do i smell oud? rose oud? none of these notes are shy notes.
As it dries in first half an hour, I am searching my smell brain am eventually recalling Habanita - sweet tobacco, leather. Yet here is no billowing powder, Chergui is creamy, leathery and deep golden. almost chewy texture.
Camels chewing dried grasses, billowing tents. Enclosed within, the scent of rose oil perfumed incense embedded in the textiles of desert worn leather and wool. Honeyed tobacco wafting, but not to me the main notes. Sandalwood peeks out towards the end. 
an unexpected scent journey for me, as leather is not listed and thankfully Chergui's tobacco isn't surrounded by that odd chai latte that other tobacco scents evoke for me.
really enjoying Chergui, for its complexity and strong character. I probably wont be buying a FB, but if there is tobacco I like so far, this is the one I like best. More than all else, this fragrance is an invitation, less to forensically inspect the quality or distinctiveness of individual notes, than to engage the ""personality"" of scent: it's individual character. More on this later. It's long lasting, but soft, almost imperceptible to the wearer, while apparent to passers by. It has almost no top notes. Therefore it's linear, I'd say synthetic. More on this later. But it's got a butch feminine vibe. Really the smell of counterculture, of revolution. Musky tobacco? Maybe a man with some feminine traits. More on this later. The actual scent is maple syrup sweet throughout, but with a leafy yellowish salty musk furriness and a dominating greasy/soapy/oily flowery roundness. But really, all the notes are synergistic, working together to convey that daring, subversive personality.
It is indeed nice, but I find that in the past I rarely found an appropriate time to wear this. Come to think of it, today may be the only day I've worn this for an entire year. It's one of those fragrances that you have as more of a measuring stick. This scent is just wonderful. It is a nice ,cosy,very unique scent,that’s hard to describe but I ‘ll give it a shot.
This one is a truly unique scent,it is just above the gender question,it won’t make you smell feminine or masculine but very interesting.
On a close sniff,it evokes a hammam spa smell,refreshing,calming ,a little cedary. It stays there but when sprayed on the back of my neck where I usually wear my perfumes,it totally takes a different turn,a U turn,if you like and becomes more of an oriental creation. It just gives that Middle Eastern vibe : there is sandy dust,dryness,rich aromatic ,slightly sweet honey and a bit of tobacco. So beautiful and long lasting,2-3 spritzes and you’ll be able to sniff it all day. Sillage is very good,my sister complimented me on it from like 2-3 steps away .
I liked it so much that I tried to sample as many scents from the house as possible. Most of them I didn’t like except for Gris Clair and Amber sultan,but they probably won’t be FB for me.
Next month I will definitely purchase Chergui,5 ml is halfway gone and I don’t wanna have to live without it:) I had high hopes but really did not care for this (at least not in this price range!) Thankfully only bought a tester . If you love this, don’t walk but RUN to fragrancenet and pick up Maroussia. $11 for 3.4 oz bottle. Ironically similar cheapie with huge sillage and longevity. Yam! Ordered sample based on love and comments here, glad to know they are reliable as this is a new love to add for me !!!! My only problem is that it’s not very strong and doesn’t last long so will need to continue to spray throughout the day, but maybe that’s the nature of this beast so never mind! A majestuous animalic tobacco fragrance. Honey/tobacco (giving an impression of hay), with a noticeable supporting vanilla and a hint of incense.
Useless to speak for hours, it's a masterpiece. While it is indeed unisex, it's not at all cloying like some previous reviews stated.
If you haven't already, test it asap!
Spring/Fall nights, 30+
Edit: it totally blooms in warmer evenings!! I've had a decant of Cherguifor a while and just finally tried it. I am in love. Honey, tobacco and booze heaven. I immediately ordered two bottles. This one just makes me feel something special. I want to love so many of Serge Lutens' creations, but they never preform on my skin like how they smell in the bottle. This one, on my skin, is hay, dry tobacco and iris. So powdery and dry. I get a very soft sweetness from the honey and amber; I have to bury my nose into my arm to find it. Maybe it's my body oil mixed with this that's playing tricks on me. I will keep testing...
For reference, Five O'Clock au Gingembre performed similarly: heavy powder, some spices, low projection and short lived. Un Bois Vanille stays close to the skin as well. My favorite from this house, so far, is Datura Noir; projects well with moderate longevity. Baby powder, honey and tobacco. Some florals also. That's what I get some from this one.
Performance is great. Lasts 10+ hours easily and projects pretty well.
I get old lady vibes from this one. It's too thick with powder and florals. Leans a bit feminine IMO, I wouldn't even want to smell this on a woman tbh. Just a very off putting fragrance.
SCORE: 0 out of 5 Is this really similar to Versace Dreamer and D&G PH Intenso? I find these to be dry and not syrupy sweet like most claim Chergui is, so I don’t understand the similarities except that they both have a hay note. Sumptuous, spicy, sweet, creamy, earthy. This is an absolutely beautiful fragrance, one which I fell in love with upon first sniff. What else is there to add that hasn't already been said? The hype is absolutely justified here in my book. Bar none, one of the best Serge Lutens and tobacco fragrances period.
9/10 this is for a second time I bought it for mam Another easy reach for most people for a Tobacco scent. Another SL hall of fame.
Often listed in most reviewers top 10 go to scents for tabacky.
Not for me. It’s safe and awesome but there are better. Not the most ground breaking SL.
It’s simply summed up a dustied, honeyed damp tobacco.
More astonishing on receiving my new bottle today was after all this time why Killian Light My Fire was so familiar. It’s an unflattering overpriced copy (Yes! - I own it). It’d been a long time since I had tried Chergui. Chergui is brighter and dustier where as LMF is a touch more syrupy and sweeter. To me it’s a blatant 85% emulation for a ridiculous skew in price - so - yep - when I run out of both I will just be buying SL Chergui again.
For reference these are my top rotation in no particular order (amongst many others owned or tried):
Xerjoff Commandante
Xerjoff Naxos
Miller Harris Feuilles De Tabac
Atelier Cologne Tobacco Nuit
Comptor Sud Pacific Rhum Et Tabac
Nicolai Parfumer Cuir Cuba Intense
Ormonde Jayne Montabacco Intense
Ormonde jayne Montabacco
Stephane Humbert Lucas 777 Qom Chilom (though no tobacco is listed)
Farmacia SS Anunziata Autore D'Tabacco
Kerosine Broken Theories
Parfum De Marly Herod
Also just purchased 19-69 Chinese Tobacco - another one to add in rotation.
Honorable mention no longer in my collection to TF TV, Piotr Czarnecki Kiviskin and Phaedon Tabac Rouge (which is similar but better than TF TV).
Hope this helps.
Happy Smelling! Based on the notes and rave reviews, I expected a little more from Chergui. I know it's a favourite of many. But I thought this would be a lot richer, and warmer than it was, based on the notes.
I'd been excited about the sample I got for this, but after spraying it on, I'm not all that impressed. I thought this would be rich, smoky and sweet, but on me, it just smells clean. Clean, and powdery, almost like laundry soap. I'm not entirely sure what's going wrong with it on me, but I don't smell any notes on the note list here.
I think it's this powdery cleanliness that conjures to mind Maroussia, by Slava Zaitsev. I don't think they necessarily smell the same, but they have the same powdery cleanliness of Maroussia.
Do I think Chergui is nice? Yes, I do. Chergui is lovely, but I don't think it's for me. I think the variety and number of reviews of this fragrance attest to its appeal and interest. As a niche fragrance neophyte, I sensibly acquired a few samples from the house of Lutens to see what it's all about. Chergui is the only one of the lot I would consider pursuing further, though I admit it took me several trials to make up my mind. As others have noted, it's complex, unique, and chimerical - but what sold me is its unique structure and development. I've never tried a scent that took so many unexpected turns while maintaining solid performance. I can't imagine how other reviewers have found this perfume to disappear after a few minutes. For me, it requires soap and vigorous scrubbing to remove after several hours. Smells expensive, distinctive, and weird - not necessarily a compliment getter, but certainly memorable. I sampled this and Filles en Aguilles today. Love the church incense aroma in FeA. Lasted all day on skin. Sponge bathed before bed and tried 2 (almost) full spritzes of Chergui. Keeping in mind it had been months...maybe a year since last worn. Not much change in my impression of FeA, however feeling the tobacco more in Chergui more now. No sampled this and Filles en Aguilles today. Love the churchy incense aroma in FeA. Lasted all day on skin. 
Took a sponge bath before bed few hours later, and tried 2 (almost) full spritzes of Chergui. Keeping in mind it had been months..maybe a year since last worn. Not much change in my impression of FeA, however I’m feeling the tobacco more in Chergui more now. 
Reminiscent of the More brand cigarettes rolled in a darker brown paper...and I always thought those smelt like straight up shit!! 
However I like this stuff..this is a Hit..strange;) My grandfather was a serious smoker, and he lived with us since I was born until he passed away. 
His day consisted of long smoking sessions in his room, watching television, going to the park to chat with his friends, and buying fresh bread from bakeries early in the morning.
Whenever he left the house to do any of those things, my mother would go and spray deodorant in his room to get rid of the intensely sweet and dark tobacco smell. 
I find it very ironic and interesting how this smell is perceived differently in cultures. In mine this is the smell of a chain smoking old man that should not spread to the rest of the house, in other's this is something that people would choose to smell like during the day and hail it as their favorite perfume. Every time I wear this scent I become more and more convinced that this is my favorite perfume. It took a few wears for the strong hay opening to grow on me but now that it has, it gives the warm tobacco such interest, and the honey really rounds it out without getting cloying. I can't imagine getting sick of this scent. It's both comforting and interesting. The word ""chergui"" comes from the Arabic ""alshrq"" or sharqi, which is the name given to anything that comes from the East, namely the Eastern wind in Morocco. Serge Lutens lives in Morocco and is passionate for its culture. Many of his inspirations comes from this magnific country, so diverse in habits and human geography. Quoting Serge Lutens about Chergui, he defines it as ""a fire spread by the wind"" referring to the eastern wind that blows from the Sahara desert, hot and dry like the perfume.
To my nose the fragrance composition enhances hay sugar, honey, tobacco leaves, incense and amber as well the inevitable wood. There are some types of hay leaves with a high sugar content, like the sugarcane hay and the ""hay of Greece"" (methi or fenugreek). In the case of the latter, its seems to have an aroma very similar to the aroma of pancake maple syrup, adding this way an unusual type of sweetness to the perfume.
Serge Lutens ideas and Christopher Sheldrake execution, managed to achieve an exquisite and pleasant and unique result. Even if it is a very ""flat"" fragrance (not a defect) it opens mainly with the floral scents of rose and Iris. A moment later you notice the enclosed sweetness of honey and amber covering the fantastic dry Virginia tobacco leaves, This stage lasts for 2.5~3.0 hours with an above average sillage and projection.
To frame this unique scent with similar fragrances is quite difficult. I would say that if compared with designer known tobacco fragrances, is miles away from London and Havana and just a bit close to Dreamer, but the dryness and the sweet hay marks the difference. After this stage, the fragrance remains dry but becomes smoother, while the incense and the woods evolve to a suede like scent. All through its duration, Chergui is quite masculine for my nose and I have some difficulties to consider it unisex.

Opinion about Chergui:
You want to smell different but in a very good way? The answer is Chergui. Use it in colder weather, in formal, occasions, a night out, or clubbing.
Recommended? Yes due to its features and uniqueness.
Blind buy worthy? No, With this price and uniqueness, you better try it first. It's not a please everybody perfume.
Music: STING & CHEB MAMI - ""DESERT ROSE"" A luxurious version of Eau des Baux; creamier and smoother. I get the hay, tobacco and honey more than anything else. De luxe. I finally got around to trying this and I really enjoy it. On paper I get a much louder and powdery result which reminds me a bit of Habit Rouge but with some warm amber underneath (I always imagined this is how Lagerfeld Classic would smell, haven't tried that one yet though). 
On my skin I can actually smell the honey with the amber and hay it creates a nice fragrance, slightly reminiscent of l'Homme Idéal EDP with added honey. Sadly however, it is rather soft on my skin (not on paper though!) and became a skin scent after an hour, perhaps it would perform better on clothing. I was hoping to love this but I didn't. Maybe it is the setting of a department store which confused my senses. It reminded me of l'Erbolario Meharées surprisingly, which is a very mice perfume. It’s popularity at the onset of the decade led to a price drop on Chergui, facilitating my entry into niche perfume. Chergui is the first “brick house” fragrance I owned; a gateway scent with such heft it made all previous purchases seem wimpy by comparison. This is a thick, syrupy-sweet blend of tobacco and honey with some gorgeous and unusual notes running through it. Dark florals, hey, amber... The juice is a thick shade of maroon that wouldn’t seem out of place sloshing around in a brandy snifter, but Chergui isn’t necessarily a boozy scent. It just has a great deal of body.
Chergui is the only fragrance I own that comes with a cap, allowing you to remove the sprayer and convert the bottle to a splash. After a few wears, I made the switch, because there’s not much point in trying to wear it conservatively. Better to lean into its weight; let it blanket you in its warmth, rather than apply it lightly in attempt to make it something it isn’t. To smell Chergui is to experience its influence on the bold philosophies that drive niche perfumery. When they build the Perfume Hall of Fame, Chergui will have a shelf all its own. The first time I wore this I was really unsure. It just smelled like menthol and hay to me. I put it on again today and got that same initial blast of menthol and hay that was almost overwhelming, but then after about 30 minutes to an hour it settled into this lovely honey tobacco scent that I'm really loving. It's not a smokey tobacco, it's like you are in a house in the country and you opened up a wooden tobacco box and took a whiff. While it's sweet, the hay lingers to dry out out a bit. And it's slightly powdery in a way that keeps it interesting. This doesn't seem like a scent you'd wear for compliments (I don't wear any scents for compliments though as I'm very sensitive to people who can't handle scents so I try to keep all scents close and just wear them for me) but it's a scent that makes you feel cozy while still being interesting. Between Vegas and Brianhead, Utah there is a secret spot to see the petroglyphs. There are no signs and you have to ask a local where it is. There are no rangers, fences, or cameras. Yet, there is no damage or graffiti. Everyone goes with curiosity and leaves with respect. If you go, bring a ladder. Legend has it---the petroglyphs tell a story of the falling man. Someone in the tribe was poisoning the watering hole and he was murdered. I do not know if the legend is true but I’ve been there a few times and it is hallowed ground. Remember to look up, because high on an outcropping is a bird of prey nest. The blue sky, red sand and white snow (in winter) transforms the spot into a desert kingdom. Chergui reminds me of this secret spot. (As do others, namely Tauer) But Chergui has an echo. A heartbeat. Smelling it is walking into myth, wearing it is becoming a legend. @ Ansarit It's just the hay, tobacco, and honey notes combining to give you that sweet illusion of cinnamon. The same thing happened to me, and has happened with many other fragrances I think have cinnamon. I find that when I actually smell cinnamon in a fragrance it smells different than how I actually imagine it to smell. Serge Lutens is not for new comer in frag head
for chergui 
i have the decant since i came in niche world
the first time i smell it is to strong for me 
but after that it grow on me time by time
till today i love how complex of the scent 
but it's not a compliment gather anyway
you need to use it for yourself not for the other I’m surprised theres no cinnamon in the notes. For me in the opening I got a huge blast of nothing but cinnamon I got my hands on the old formulation and I bought the new reformulation's 100ml bottle! no difference according to my nose. 
UNIQUE. Screaming quality. This is a true solid release from Serge Lutens! very well blended. 
I'm not an expert to analyze the notes but I can detect: Tobacco, cacao, honey, amber, soft incense & mellow iris! so it could be described as a soapy tobacco scent.
In terms of longevity it's +10 hours (sprayed 2 sprays on wrist) 
I should be stocking bottles from this. It is a great great great release I cannot get enough of how awesome this bottle smells! The tobacco note here is similar to that in Versace Dreamer - a bright, sweet scent reminiscent of ""cherry flavouring"". Not the kind of tobacco I like, unfortunately! It's hard to put into words how this fragrance makes me feel. I live in a warm climate and tend to save it for the slightly chillier winter months like now and when I wear Chergui, it just wraps me up in this deliciously sweet, spicy yet tender embrace. I tend to change my fragrance daily, yet I find myself wearing this for days at a time. I wear it to work and get many compliments. It is not too strong nor over the top at all and you don't need a special occasion to wear it. It lasts the whole day and goes into the evening. I actually prefer Chergui to Dior's Feve Delicieuse which I find too cloying for my taste and it's less expensive, too which is always a plus. You usually can't go wrong with a Lutens and Chergui is my favorite of them all. i sprayed this on my cheap poliester zara pants and they transformed into something that could seem very expensive and luxurious fabric. lol Am I the only one who finds this similar to Versace The Dreamer? Hmmmmm....on the fence with this one...???
Sugary-honey opening,amber sweet booze...goes back and forth....so...well blended at least. Something keeps pulling me back to feel the scent...and it grabs me..then ltes me go again...LOL...if that makes sense? I also somehow get a fruit/vanilla vibe underneath...
Further wearings needed...to fully judge. But shall I say it is....UNIQUE....??? So far, yes. It does go to a skin scent rather quickly...on me. To me, it´s a honeybomb! Too much of the honey- at least on my skin, such a shame :( It ´s not for me , but I highly appreciate the longevity & sillage of this fragrance. On me it lasts forever. I couldn´t even wash it off. Chergui functions more as an irrational number than a typical A->B->C formula. Every sniff feels like a game of roulette to see what note you will pop out next (Lotion->Honey->Barnyard->Lotion->Tobacco ad nauseam). The lack of ""discernible"" pattern here makes Chergui come off disorderly and chaotic, but that's simultaneously it's best quality. A smell that takes you along a very warm and cozy trail. It smells like cookies, carrot cake or carrot jam. It is not sickly sweet, perfectly balanced. I get hay, rose and some milky undertone. If any of your loved ones bakes at home and you like being around that smell, then this is the perfect fragrance. I love it and wear it very often. There is a reason that this is one of Serge Luten's best selling fragrances, it brings on the feeling of home and family. very pleasant quality of sweet honey tobbaco smell 
not overpowering ... but depends how many sprays you put on the coat/scarf/sweater/hat .... my neighbours told me i can be smelled from about 2 meters from them ... :) funny meeting as always Most tobacco fumes run spicy, but Chergui runs sweet and smooth.
You know how some notes have temperatures? The way ginger and spice 'feel' warm, and lily cold? 
Despite the honey and tobacco in Chergui, there's something cool about it, like the sensation you get when you smell mint. And it loads what could have been just a cozy feel-good fume with total sophistication. (I suspect it's the hay.) This is all scented talcum powder. Typically speaking I’m a great fan of unisex powdery scents, but not to the point where it seems like I am actually wearing powder under my clothes. It is sophisticated and moreso for an older person. More feminine than masculine, but I can see some men wearing this for the dry down. The hay note is not as bad as I would think it would be. Well blended, but to the point where it’s hard to discern any other notes, very small amount of tobacco if any. Would not consider this a tobacco scent but a powdery scent. The color of the fragrance gives a false impression that it will be a darker scent, it’s light. Certainly not a blind buy. Reminds me of the food network meme: “I made a breaded chicken piccata with lemon jasmin rice.” and the judge goes, “um this is a chicken nugget.” Overall, happy to try it and can certainly appreciate it. But this is not something I personally would buy. It started out like very strong zest soap and aftershave. Later, I get honey, amber, tobacco, sandalwood. The powder that people are describing smells like powerful sandalwood to me. I like it. After drydown I think it ends up almost like a sweet, soft, hippy type of scent- like a clean, lovely, flannel shirted, long haired mountain man who might be managing the fireplace on an early fall day and the smoke lingers on him.
I'm sure the other notes round out the fragrance, but they do not stand out to me. brilliant, lovely and cosy fragrance for fall
honeyed tobacco leather ... like a warm cup of tea in the mountain cottage In my first experience w/ Chergui I was not impressed. I was barely able to smell it off my skin. My opinion may change because I’ve als had this same experience w/ Tom Ford Oud Wood which I now love. I’ll have to give Chergui another try one day soon. I was more impressed with Amber Sultan. Okay. I've finally fallen for this. I initially found it smelt of laundry detergent. What was I thinking??? This is stunning! It's like burning resins and tobacco combined with amber and powdery violet. Quite unusual. Sweet / sour mix that just instantly enraptures. Stunning! I'm a Serge groupie, love his fragrances and what he achieved for niche perfumery. Just blind bought a 50ml bottle of Chergui but it's not quite what I was expecting, it's actually really nice and wearable. I thought it would be a bit more challenging, which is the Serge I prefer. The baby powder and honey notes in this are taking centre stage on me, which is lovely, but I want spicey, you can't wear me to the office, Serge. 
Anybody like to swap? I couldnt recall if I reviewed this. Anyway, its a wonderful scent, but an absolutely lousy performer. Someone in this thread said it would be among their favorites if it performed better. I agree. The sillage is ok, for five minutes. The longevity is literally about five to ten minutes. Then i sense very little. Its there, very very very close to the skin. But thats it. Its a pity, too, because this is a classy take on the back alleys of the Medina in Tangier or Rabat. The pigment sellers in marrakesch....thats what it reminds me of. But for only five to ten minutes. I recently acquired this one blindly. It is a cooler autumn day here. This is a gorgeous scent! I don't seem to have a lot of luck with Lutens' fragrances....either hit or miss. This one is lovely though!To my nose I am getting the tobacco and a bit of the honey. Worth a try if the notes sound interesting to you. I wonder what is so wrong with my nose. I am looking for a tobacco scent and, after testing many fragrances and reading notes/reviews, I was so happy to try this one.
Where the heck is tobacco here? I only smell lot of synthetic sandal wood.
I really start to wonder what is wrong with my perceptions, as it can’t be that all of you guys who praise this as a must try for Tobacco lovers be mistaken ..
Sad... Chergui. I got my 3 bottles in 2012. Fell in love with the hay opening which is very velvety and way elegant, Marlene Dietrich style. 2 hours later the hay tons down to leave space for the amber/tobacco/honey accord which on my skin smells like hands that played with groceries then picked dirt form the floor turning into a dusty musk sweetness, not vanilla sweetness. The strange thing is that the smell is so wonderful on me that my wife always gets close to sink her nose on my neck and kiss me and always compliments me on how delicious and sensual I smell. This experience lasts for about 14 hours with only one spray. Wonderful Chergui Outstanding , simply divine at every level, performance is excellent, at least on me, the smell is a m a z i n g, honey-tobacco-hay-smoothness-sexy-intoxicating, my God this is beautiful , 10/10 without a doubt. This gets a lot of love but honestly to my nose it’s just not that interesting. Nothing stands out maybe I’m asnomic to it? Not sure but for me it wasn’t worth the money spent. There is a sort of spice to it but watery as well. Meh I can easily understand why people like Chergui. It's smooth and well blended. Unisex. Adequate performance.
I would love to love this perfume.
Everyone and their mother aleady mentioned the strong, initial burst of hay, so let's talk more about the Tobacco instead. In Tom Ford's Tobacco Vanille it's gorgeous from start to finish and more about the tobacco leaf. Chergui on me is very... I-smoked-a-Marlborough-just-now-and-trying-to-hide-it-with-my-sweet-perfume-ish. There is even a very faint note of old sweat. To be fair, after 30 mins the tobacco has weakened to nearly tolerable levels. ""Nearly"", being the key word. 
So for now I will give Chergui a ""Like"" and try it again in a few months. It's hauntingly beautiful on all my friends (all genders); creamy, sweet, powdery and warm. It's not Chergui, it's me.
Edit: a friend pointed out that maybe I shouldn't be hatin' on the Tobacco, maybe I should be hatin' on the incense? Maybe? I've never before had an issue with incense… I'll think about it.
Edit 2: I can't stand the opening. After about one to one and a half hour it's a truly stunning fragrance, full bottle worthy even! But the process of getting to that stage… Can't do it. The combination of sweet-hay-smoked cigarette-sweat… Damn. Niche fragrance very good The opening is unpleasant wet hay but the remaining life of the perfume is the perfect dry fall fragrance. Spicy amber with Smokey incense and woods. The rose and iris are listed because of the nice baby powder vibe. I do not get honey or tobacco. Truly unisex, nothing feminine here. This would be nice layered or worn alone. I do feel others fit this category so it isn’t necessary if you already have Smokey ambers. Reminds me of pumpkin pie and thanksgiving in general. Can not see myself reaching for it too often, but I'm glad I own it. Fall exclusive scent. Very lukewarm on this one, Honestly the round wet dull-ness just bores me I think pure Havane even does a better hay-like tobacco once it dries down for at least 30 minutes This is a really beautiful niche fragrance that smells to my nose of the scent of honeyed amber with sweet tobacco and the unique note of hay, and also cinnamon. It smells like a sweet ambery drink on a rainy day in a farm stable. Although that may not sound that appealing, it smells fantastic in my opinion. Sillage is moderate while longevity is quite good at over 6 hours. This is one of the best amber offerings out there as far as quality and uniqueness of scent goes.
4.5/5 I had high expectations going into this and the first 5 minutes were a little disappointing, but once the top notes fade it settles into one of the most beautiful fragrances that I've tried. I'm smelling all the same notes between the top and heart notes, but somehow they become more and more well-blended as time passes. I don't know that I would be able to pick out the tobacco if I didn't already know it was going to be there--everything just melds together so beautifully to be a somewhat sweet, ambery, delicious scent. I normally don't like honey as a note because, rather than smell the honey itself, I feel like it just sort of mutes whatever other notes it's blended with, but in Chergui the honey is used perfectly to bring everything together in a very pleasing way. Velvety. Like fine, yummy red velvet cake. Very sensual. Refined. Intoxicating! There is a very subtle sugar in this fragrance. Mixed to perfection. Nothing juvenile, but very elegant.
A heavy elixer indeed. The warmth, the spices, the leather, the top back on, the mix of the sugary goodness. What can I really tell you about this. It seems that it appeals to the masses but yet keeps to that niche that we all love. A very unisex fragrance. This is another one that my husband and I share. I think however, I do wear it more than he does.
The performance of this fragrance, is most excellent. Above average. I actually smell it on me the next day. When I wear this fragrance, it’s one of those that I find myself grabbing my own wrists, and sniffing, and sniffing, I just can’t get enough. Pure indulgence in a bottle. I am being slowly seduced by Chergui. I wanted a beguiling oriental scent, like the winds of the Arabian desert... But, it was too sweet. And the baby powder was an unwelcome surprise. So I said goodbye to Chergui... 
The other day, I was being hammered by a SA about it. So I sprayed Chergui on paper and put it in my car. A few hours later, ""The car smells really nice..."" I shook my head, and ignored it. But over the next 1 hour 20 minutes the same thought kept popping up. I transferred the test strip to my bedroom, and every time I entered, ""The room smells MAGICAL!!!"" 
Whatever it was, however it was, why-ever it was - I decided Chergui was a quality beast! It's better than most niche scents. And it's magnetic. You don't need to be looking out for it for it to charm you! 
True, it's not what I was expecting. Much less ""oriental"" and more sweet and powdery. Still an oriental. Soft and whispery - not like Ambre Sultan - which is spicy and full-on, and I think I was comparing it to. 
I'll try Chergui on skin, and if it is equally wonderful I will add it to my collection! Oh, Chergui, you are rarified and lovely. Your ambery goodness is alluring, potent, and compelling, but unfortunately I am testing you on one wrist while I am testing Ambre Sultan on the other, and Ambre Sultan wins. Your brightness doesn't call to me the way Ambre Sultan's darkness lures me in. Maybe it's all the heavy, resinous amber oil I wore when I was younger, I don't know. I understand why you are popular, but I just can't join your legion of fans. Very close, but not quite.
Update many hours later: The dry down is decadent, warm, and creamy, exactly what I was craving. Ok, you win. I just ordered a full bottle because I am weak and you are beautiful. Ooh this is a beauty! Very different and distinct. 
It sort of smells like a tamed down TF Tobacco Vanille - once you get it to calm down, give it a good shower and let it have a rest. It has the same sweet tobacco & creamy vanilla quality, but sultry and seductive rather than all-out bestial and skanky. 
The opening is sweet, so sweet that I honestly thought I could smell tuberose or something similar, but apparently there are no white florals in this! It must be the combo of amber, honey and sandalwood, as the perfume does open with a strongly sweet, creamy, 'white' smelling blast that comes across as white floral. 
The projection is above average to strong, and the longevity is excellent as it lasts more than two hours on my skin - which tends to eat up the overwhelming majority of fragrances within 60-90 minutes tops. 
This is a really standout perfume: elegant, sultry, seductive, intoxicating, and unisex (leaning more on the feminine side, though). What a masterpiece! The honey and tobacco stood out and I could barely smell other notes. The two notes are contradictory yet complementary at the same time. Simply stunning! I am in love with it since the first sniff. It is so famous for a reason. This is one of my two favourites in Serge Lutens while another being La Fille de Berlin. Think Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille, where the vanilla is substituted by honey infused with pipe tobacco and hay. Once it settles down the whiffs are sublime & embracing. The trick is not to over apply but target the chest and pulse regions.
In the drydown the tobacco & hay are faint and the honey more pronounced with notes of iris and tonka. 
At this stage, you get a phantom cocoa note emerging from the combination of the basenotes lightly resembling LIDGE L'Instant De Guerlain Extreme. 
Class in a bottle. 
4 Stars The Birth of Liquid Fears by Salvador Dali 1932 The most beloved in the amazingly eclectic and beautiful Serge Lutens line of offerings is this delicate Oriental ambery beauty which is inspired by the ambience of the Tunisian island it takes its name after. Like the shifting sands and water of this African paradise, the perfume shifts and morphs on your skin in so many ways, maintaining a delicate balance between the modern and the ancient. Chergui takes off with a nice tobacco leaf, delicate iris and rose, and grassy hay accord. As it begins to settle once notices a honey, incense and ambery centre. Finally it settles into a musky powdery base comprised of sandalwood, musk and amber. This scent is the stuff of dreams, exotic yet never overwhelming. In fact, this is probably the world's first true unisex perfume, a masterfully blended beauty with moderate sillage and projection and very good longevity. One of those perfumes I always had the pleasure of having a bottle in my collection since it first arrived on the market some 15 years ago. A true masterpiece of modern perfumery. Enjoy! Chergui invokes the scene of being outdoors on a cool night at a countryside property and starting up a raging bonfire with flintstones then settling down on a haybale with a glass of whiskey in hand and an unlit cigar in the other. A lovely experience. I did try it out last week.
Now I am wearing it. 
Received it yesterday with another Niche fragrance: Acqua di Parma Cedro di Taormina, the type of fragrance that puts a smile on my face, no matter what.
But it's 8 degrees C. today, so I'm wearing Chergui. A type of fragrance that will have ""to grow on me"".
As if that would be possible. A perfume doesn't grow on us, we (try to) grow on them.
Question is: should I want to broaden my horizon, while there are already so many fragrances that tickle my senses positively, from day one?
Do I really need to expand my ""collection"" when most of the stuff I have already is being neglected?
But it’s this insatiable desire to find fragrances that will knock me off. The Holy Grail. 
I’m sure it won’t be Chergui though. 
The weird thing is that I realized, it will be like this after I tested it last week. I guess I just wanted something different. Which it is.
For now, it reminds me of Jaguar Classic Red. 
For one sixth of the price, that one is far more wearable.
Sure, Chergui lasts longer, but it takes about 3 hours before I start to like it.
And if it’s exclusivity that I’m looking for, something that not “everybody wears”, than I’m sure that Jaguar is the more exclusive, lesser known fragrance.
In time I will let you know, if it grew on me. A great one , that more people should try out. 
This is a more modest and very slightly more feminine leaning TF Tobacco Vanille.
This is quality stuff that is more subtle than I expected. That being said it is a lady killer and a must sniff for the fragrance lover.
This is not loud like pure havane or as playful as viktor and rolf extreme, so don't come in expecting this.
4 to 6 hours and a skin scent after a hour on me. 
French Elegance I gave into the hype and blind bought this years ago and it still remains in my collection.
I'm absolutely in LOVE with this fragrance, I wore it when I started college so it holds many memories. When I first smelled this I knew I was going to keep it for the rest of my life. 
Lots of tobacco with warm honey, it turns hot on my skin after a few hours and into a powdery soft hay with some musk. I do wish the lasting power was a bit stronger for what I pay, but I still love this nonetheless.
Gourmands, fruity florals, fresh citrus scents tend to do better on my skin, most spicy orientals never work with my chemistry. However, I think this is a good introduction into spicier fragrances, because of the sweetness it still works on me.
I remember a few guys asking if I was wearing a suntan lotion saying I smelled like I was at the beach. 
This is a staple in my fragrance collection! Women should try this if you're into ""dark"" and ""sexy"" fragrances. 
P.S I find this is similar to Spicebomb by Viktor and Rolf, but that one turns into a dryer sheet on me. I REALLY wish I would have tested this before buying a full size bottle. I was really expecting more of a tobacco scent. On me, all I can detect is a sweet amber (amber is one of my least favs). I have used a single spray, bottle arrived today, 3/22/18. If anyone wants to purchase or trade, please message me. On me: cool, bracing, aftershave notes that smell manly.
On my partner: sweet hay, soft tobacco, warm honey.
I have never experienced such a huge shift in notes from man to woman, and unfortunately, it goes the wrong way, smelling like men's aftershave on me, the woman, and a spicy oriental women's fragrance on my man. 
Try before you by, this one's odd. Bee-young-ka nailed this- The baby powder dry down is a weird turn-on. Im guessing it comes from having used Johnson's baby oil in the bedroom at some point in the past. When combined with the other (background) notes (tobacco, musk) you get something that is akin to the smell of a bedroom after sex.
Would smell incredible on women folk. Amazing! Tobacco, amber, incense, and honey. “Beautiful” is the only way to describe it. Easily the best tobacco based fragrance I’ve ever smelled. On the sweet side but done very, very well. In fact, other brands should use this as the benchmark for how to use honey in a fragrance. If you like only one of this type of fragrance, it will be this one. Sillage and projection are moderate to heavy with a solid 6 to 8 hours before going to skin for 4 to 6 hours more. Warm and wonderful from beginning to end. Masculine leaning unisex perfect for evenings or a crisp day. Super classy. This one is back up bottle and signature worthy. Easy to over-apply so easy on the pump. Worth every dollar and a stone cold bargain if you get it at a discount. Well done Serge!
5 out of 5. Chergui for me smells sweet and slightly seductive, like burnt honey, it is reminiscent of Arabian nights but without a heavy Oud vibe, This fragrance is definetly unisex and depsite it's sweetness it is perfectly fine for men. the smell is very pleasing, but the performance is disapointing 
Longevity 5/10 - after only 2 hours I can't notice this anymore except on my skin, for the price this is disappointing.
Silage 7/10 - the silage is decent for the first hour or two I always see this pop up as a comparison for some of my favorite spicy fragrance. It's always noted as being the better of what I consider a favorite 
(like Diptyque Volutes). So my expectation were high. 
Possibly too high. I wasn't impress and it wasn't the Cinnabar(Estee Lauder) or Opium(Yves Saint Laurent) I thought it to be. 
My problem with Chergui is that it is too dominating( i.e masculine). It's just very heavy on spice, pepper , tobacco and not ..well... balanced. Something powdery, citrus or floral should have been added to make it likable for me. 
Volutes is more my speed. However, Chergui a sophisticated fragrance( as it is rightfully considered by many on here ),-- but just not my speed.
2/19/18: Its Tom Ford Sahara Noir that this is compare too. Sahara Noir is intense but with a wink- Chergui is just intense. ok, let me start by saying Serge Lutens & Chris are my favorites.
But this I find to smell sooo powdery.
expensive black tie but still incredibly powdery. 
Wish I could smell even one other note!
On me to my nose, pure powder. 
...but its not a dry powder.
this is a very damp scent, fetid even.
weirdly sexy. 
Freudian weird.
Smells better on the men folk. I hate tobacco, I hate incense, I hate hay, but I LOVE this.
This fragrance is so well balanced and blended. The tobacco does not smell like cigarettes, it is sweet and almost herbal. The hay does not smell like barnyard it hints at animalic notes and makes me think of expensive saddlery. The incense is not a dusty church but a deep mysterious smoke.
An intriguingly seductive scent; unique, rich, and just a hint dirty (in the best way). Expertly blended tobacco and hay formulation - possibly the best frag in the SL line. Highly recommended. Love the sweet tobacco in this perfume , absolute gem, will definitely be adding to my collection, projection and silliage great, 10 out of 10 chergui. I wanted to love it but I find it too feminine @Chazas: Actually, it feels more delicate than the old Chergui I remeber. it is also less smokey and overwhelming, but still nice and well constructed. I can't say about the sillage, since until now I've received no comments about from people around me, and it surprise me because I've sprayed it four times (on neck and chest and both wrists). I cannot smell anything around me, but only if I put my nose in my shirt. Well, I don't wanna say I'm disappointed, but... finally I have CHERGUI!!! I wanted it for so long, since I tried it in 2013. I love it. <3
It is my signature fragrance, both with A la nuit and Shalimar. This isn't the east wind that picks up spices, dust and heat. It is the east wind that infiltrates nomadic tents and absorbs the odours of honey, tobacco, animal bedding and dusty iris and rose.
Chergui is a cozy, dusty blanket seeping sweetness. From afar it stays linear, but as i am want to do when i wear this, i cannot stop smelling close and recognising its various elements taking turns at showing themselves.
Moderate projection and excellent longevity.
Try this in warmer weather as well. It blooms. I'm shivering as I type. Currently 47 degrees Fahrenheit and I'm told the perfect climate to wear Chergui. 
Initial thoughts are sweet honey and spicy tobacco, dusted into fine powder.
The honey is photorealistic at times and a standout note with spiced pipe tobacco and light amber playing supporting roles. 
Soft, powdery iris provides a dusty texture that is the most unique aspect of the fragrance.
Blended together, Chergui is a unique artistic creation that doesn't immediately remind me of any other scents. 
Pleasant and certainly enjoyable on an intellectual level, the overall scent itself is not something that elicits a positive visceral reaction out of me.
Well done but not something I would wear often. I got this one so wrong when I first got it. I found it too sweet and powdery. I put it away as a potential swap or sell. 
But. 
I got it out a few weeks ago and I can’t believe I almost got rid of it. It is so good. Yes it is sweet, yes it is powdery, but it is also so spicy and the tobacco is on another level. This is so cozy, so masculine, so wearable. Perfect for fall and winter. The only problem now is that I feel less confident about getting rid of some of the scents I don’t like, what if they pull a Chergui on me?! 
This one is great. Get it. A masterpiece. Very well blended. Chergui is very well balanced, an inspiration for the new perfumistas generation! When I first wore this (and still) I had in the opening the same feeling as I had with Dior Fahrenheit. Don't call this 'offensive', because it was in a positive way. Very alluring scent. Though, I find Chergui much more pleasing than Fahrenheit. Chergui is very versatile and it's like they call it: a very good entrance into Niche perfumes."
4,Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001," fresh out of the shower, citrus and a white flower. clean simple and elegant. classic but also definately modern and unisex. not super special or exciting tho, safe buy for lovers of the above tho I think a bit pricy for what it is. I have it for those days when I want to smell clean and fresh but not overly perfumed. but I'll probably not repurchase just for the price of it. I'd say go for it if a mugler fan but otherwise I'm sure theres many cheaper drugstore dupes! From a house that often scares me, I was amazed when discovered this green juice many years ago. I had developed an idea that I was someone not suited to citrus notes; they seemed to go ""sour"" on my skin after a few hours, especially in very hot weather. So, I was very surprised to learn just how many citrus notes are in this one (though I guess the name should have been a clue) and I think it was when I learned that not all citrus is equal, least of all where my pedantic skin is concerned. Not being one of those fragrance professionals who know the turns of phrase with which scents should be described, my oversimplification to sum it up was ""fizzy, green, cream soda"". I also suspect there's something unexpectedly Nordic about it , again odd, given the materials. But I noticed that when I was wearing it in Norway and Sweden people would usually make positive comments. And after a while I noted a certain similarity to some of the crisp, clean herbal aromas coming out of their summer kitchens of raw and cold dishes. Please understand that all of this is meant in a hugely positive way: it remains one of my go-to options; the perfect antidote to a sweaty, busy day when you don't want to be the person others move away from in a meeting. Damn thats citrusy! It hits you right away with that Bergamot, but it's kind of bland almost soapy. 
Maybe for use after the shower but that's it!! 3/10 This is an absolute staple.
The citrusy-bitter-green opening is like the sun coming out from behind a dark cloud! Citrus fades to soapy and you feel like you're in a shower all day. I understand how people say it doesn't last on them; I feel like I get immune relatively fast (20 minutes or so) but I guarantee that EVERYONE around you will smell it ALL day. From time to time, I catch a whiff of it on myself - it's elusive like that.
On fabric it lasts a long time, it may fade but it will certainly be there on a forgotten scarf months later and quite recognizable. Awesome flac and gear that comes with it. This is (again) a staple. I think I've figured out why there are so many reports of ""this lasts so long!"" with other reports of ""does not last at all!""
In my experience, Mugler Cologne lasts super long (like insane longevity for a fresh scent). When I was testing it in the store 2 years ago I got some on my jacket arm by accident and I could smell it for 2 weeks without putting my arm near my nose. I was blown away by the crazy longevity on my jacket. After using it for a while and specifically re-testing it yesterday/today I am now at my conclusion.
Last night I put one spray on my arm (skin) at 10pm and today I can still smell it at 2:30pm wafting in the air after I just did a bunch of pushups etc. If I put my nose up to it, it's strong. That's 16 freakin hours.
This is the type of scent that can hide out as a skin scent for a while UNTIL it's reactivated by body heat at which point ppl could be like ""I thought it was gone but it's 16 hours later and I smell it again! What the heck!?""
People who spray it on the back of their neck or somewhere away from their nose might think it's gone but they should try getting their body heat up to see if it starts projecting again. Soapy fresh, clean, out the shower and long lasting. Surprising sillage. Got a decant, not sure of year, batch etc. Sprayed on inside bend of both elbows after shower around noon, going on 7 hrs now and it's still projecting. Constant whiffs. Been reading comments about poor performance. Dry skin, skin chemistry, idk but it's great on my skin. I find the Moroccan soap story very fitting. Although when I smell it, it doesn't remind me of a Moroccan soap, but it takes me to a holiday in the mediterranean.
I purchased the small bottle in duty free, used it in Andalusia, Spain. Years later, I purchased the large bottle online, it is refillable; which I appreciate. I find the juice in the smaller bottle slightly more intense.
This gives comfort in a hot day. Gives sense of cleanliness and happiness in any day all year round. A very simple and minimal fragrance, but not flat. Nothing is missing!
I never spritz this one without getting positive comments from men, women, children, experienced noses, ordinary noses... A true crowd pleaser. But this crowd pleaser has a personality!
At home, I use it mainly for the gym, when I go for a run, after a hike, or even simply after shower in the hot summer. I use it everyday when I'm traveling in a warm humid climate.
No it doesn't have any resemblance to Tom Ford's Neroli Portofino other than that both have citrus notes, inoffensive and less long lasting. Both are stunning and favourites of mine, they are very different!
Cons; No sillage, weak longevity (which is expected of a cologne)
Pros; it smells clean and expensive. Unisex. Safe to wear anywhere, anytime of day, any season.
Solution; get the big bottle and decant. Carry the decant and reapply on the go.
Best scenario; early morning, a loose white linen dress/shirt. I blind tested this and oh, am I glad. A fresh green beauty that vaguely recalls Atelier Cologne's Trefle Pur. I get citrics, green leaves, something subtle and floral and there's more going on than the pyramid suggests. Nice sillage for about an hour and I wish there was more longevity. An EDT? An unseasonal testing but I will reach for this again in the depths of July. Lovely. I almost blind bought this because I'm into soapy frags ATM but instead I got a carded sample .
Talk about dodging a bullet. 
Either I am nose blind to this after 5 seconds or this is the weakest thing I've ever tried to smell. 
I can barely smell this stuff even sticking my nostrils to my wet wrist and what I do smell is gone in a matter of minutes. 
I know it's Cologne concentration but give me a break this smells like water concentration 😕 5 word review:
Irish Spring in a bottle. Unfortunately, on me this is an unremarkable citrus/musk perfume, with little sillage or lasting power. I'm just not getting the magic that some other reviewers experience. At first the citrus overwhelms, but after a while the musk does come through a little. It is just not particularly complicated or nuanced, I am shock how simple it is for the price. I'm glad I just got a mini and didn't blind buy the bottle. I did test this back in 2001 when it launched, and boys, what a great scent it was! At today I still remember the impression it made on me. Was an absolute delight, unique and so unlike all other fragrances around. 
Just a few days ago I went reminishing about it. From more recent reviews it sounds as if it has been reformulated - what a pity, this was an incredible number! To those who complain about longevity: please note, this is a cologne not an EDP ;) ... and it was suave, unlike the many around these days. 
Seems as if with time people's nostrils got used to stronger and stronger scents, and now seek punches not caresses of notes... or maybe pollution rendered us anosmic! Smells interesting for ten minutes, and then doesn't smell at all. Disappointing. Meh... just blah. I got a vintage sample in the hopes that I would really like it and that the longevity would be better. Not the case. It disappears within 20 minutes. It’s also not soapy or citrusy. It’s very bland with a slight crispy green note. I wish to God that there was a resemblance to Irish Spring but there’s just a boring, diluted coincidence to Green Tea. There’s a weird bitter base note in my sample also. I don’t know if maybe the juice in my sample turned or if that’s attributed to this scent in general. Nothing really special here to me. There are so many better alternatives on the market today for a “clean, soapy, fresh out of the shower” scent that have stood the test of time. J Lo’s Glow, Elizabeth Arden’s Green Tea and Tommy Girl are all cheaper with better longevity than this. I also find them to be pretty unisex as well. I was hoping the neroli in this was going to be a game changer but 👎 [Mugler Cologne]
CLEAN - FRESH - FLEETING
Lovely, but so incredibly boring. The positive: nice freshness.
The negative: bitter green burned hair notes.
Feminine opening. Neutral ground in the middle, nice salted lemon. 
Late stage makes it not worthwhile for me, at least won't buy it again. Kind of like Aqua Di Gio, in the sense that there's a nice fresh top end but at the price of a bitter bass/base.
Sorry if you're offended those of you who loves this.
A better option for men would be Mugler Ice (angel ice) or Dolce light blue. These are much more consistent with no negatives in my view. I have a batch from 2003 and one from 2020. The difference is big, especially in longevity. My 2003 batch has 7+ hours of performance, the 2020 one only around 2-3. The smell is very similar and I wouldn‘t pay for the new one. Clean and uplifting and easy spray and go scent it is a great high heat scent because it doesn't come off as a ""cologne"" but just clean. It's a keeper in my collection At first when I received this fragrance I wasn't blown away because to me it wasn't special but there are those days where you want to just wear something that says I'm not trying too hard and this is a good scent to wear on those days. It doesn't smell sexy like a ""cologne"" or any note that may be offensive no! It just smells clean. I love this scent so much it's my most used bottle in my collection because it's a very good dumb reach and I use it literally every day after I get out the shower and carry an atomizer with me to respray throughout the day I do 5 sprays 3x a day. I love the bottle design and, I love the sprayer too because it's not narrow and it sprays a very good amount, and the sound it makes when you hit the atomizer sounds like whoosh! It's great also smells kinda creamy to me. A very enjoyable green and fresh smelling fragrance. Starts off with a soft citrus vibe and drys down to what others described as clean soapy scent to me reminiscent of the older Irish Spring or Coast soap. Great for the summer or if you just want a fresh clean feeling. 
I don’t know if it’s just my batch but performance leaves a lot to be desired. 
2 hours if you are lucky and not just based on my nose alone. 
Would recommend just not a great performer. I purchased Mugler Cologne a year ago because I heard it smells a lot like Irish Spring Soap and figured that this could be a go-to work scent for days when I just wanted to smell clean and freshly showered and didn't want to make it obvious I was wearing a fragrance.
This is certainly a safe and inoffensive work scent, one I used a lot last summer and this summer at work.
That said it smells nothing like Irish Spring soap. I have a bar right beside me and they smell nothing at all alike. Irish Spring is very green, a synthetic green, but green nonetheless. Mugler cologne on the other hand smells like neroli, bergamot, and a floral, orange musk. I probably should have expected as much given the note breakdown, but for whatever reason I was expecting the green, soapy freshness of Irish Spring.
This does smell soapy and very fresh and clean, but not green or herbal.
Mugler cologne smells like a more unisex version of my mom's signature scent D&G Light Blue. I gave her a decant of Mugler cologne and she loves it. It leans a touch more feminine than I'm used to; I wouldn't call it a feminine scent, it's firmly unisex, but don't be expecting a masculine scent like Irish Spring.
Mugler cologne is an excellent, office safe scent that'll have you smelling fresh out of the shower for 8-10 hours. Thierry Mugler Cologne opens with a strong projection of citrus, musky and soft green accords, the opening is sharp, intense, vibrant, fresh, simple but very pleasant. The bergamot is a prominent note, citrusy intense and sour; the neroli and orange flower are also noticeable, a white floral note, slightly bitter, with hints of orange. The petitgrain is noticeable as well, evocative of orange leaves, with a green touch. The white musk is the last and projecting note, this musk isn’t animalic or pungent, a very tone down the type of musk with good projection qualities and well blended with the citrus notes. The fragrance is relatively linear, the bergamot loses some of its initial sharpness but it is noticeable from opening thru the dry-down, also the initial strong projection takes one step down to moderate. Once Thierry Mugler Cologne has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a moderate projection, neroli, bergamot, and white musk fragrance with green petitgrain accords. The fragrance feels airy, casual, clean, cold, diurnal, fresh, green, modern, musky (white), refreshing, sharp, short-lived, sour, unisex, versatile, zesty and pleasant.

This is the smell of the vocation I went in Mexico. There’s this resort where after a day of pool ocean and cenotes diving everyone smelled a different shade of this since it was the scent of the amenities and it was great mix in all that pool water sunscreen and ocean smell that lingers everywhere aha -- i read that this is now much weaker than the original formulation. praise be. in that case i might give it another try. the original was absolutely, unbearably, suffocatingly, overwhelmingly, interminably PRESENT until i thought i will have to cut off a limb to be rid of the smell. which wasn't bad per se. just -- too ... too...
let's see how this new iteration does. Amazing.
Brilliant.
Timeless.
What a wonderful gem.
10/10 Mugler Cologne. So this is the weirdest bottle in my collection. Do I enjoy wearing it? Not really...do I think it smells good? eh...smells bad? No...
The weird thing is it has its purpose. And when I have it on, it works! I debate on selling this pretty much every month and every time I put it for sale, I take it down because I dont want to let it go...
This is type of stuff I put on when I dont want smell like I went out my way to put something on, especially if all i'm doing that day is cleaning the house, walking the dog, or going to the gym. Finished an original bottle so bought the new shape. After a few wears, it dawned on me that this new stuff lasts nowhere near what the original did. I'm astounded at the difference. It smells the same but its gone in under an hour.
Feeling like i've been had... It opens with super citric bitter bergamot on me. It's slightly vinigary first 10 minits. Bergamot stays most prominent until the deep dry-down on me. Sligtly soapy, slghtly floral, and little bit woody form vetiver and petit grain is what I get also. So it was not realy like Maroccan soap for me unfortunantely, more like green unsweetened bergamot. So I decided to add a few drops of vetiver oil in it. After a few moths of melioration It become much better. Less bitter, little bit sweeter, cleaner and more soapy, and it lasted longer. Now it realy reminds me of Earl Gray tea, a realy good, little bit sweetend up Earl Ggray. Super clean & linear. Smells like Irish Spring or Something along those lines. Great projection and longevity. Projection is about two hours, longevity is probably 10 hours. I’ve gotten anywhere between 8 to 12 hours longevity.
7/10 Has this been reformulated? I just got a 5ml sample of Mugler Cologne after waiting and wondering for a long time. I heard all the hype. It does smell like Irish Spring soap, very clean and fresh. Scent is really nice; perfect for spring and summer days. However, I get no performance from it. I'm nose blind to it right away, after 15 minutes. I only smell it if I put my nose close to the skin. What's going on here? I thought this was supposed to be a great one...? Mugler cologne is something clean and filthy. The fresh and bitter opening carries out the soapy smell of the white flowers. The white musk is always the key note in some fragrances to create the image of something clean, but the petitgrain kind of makes that clean smell a bit of animalic and filthy. Anyway, it caught me off guard that this fragrance is from the Thierry Mugler house.
Rumour has it that the formula of this fragrance is something confidential as is shown in the perfume pyramid.
Well, if you wanna wear something safe and inoffensive, I think the Mugler cologne might be a good option. I love this scent, and know I've found a cheaper alternative:
Axe Wild Green Mojito & Cedarwood Soapy Irish Spring kind of scent. Ideal for after your workout or to freshen up with your lady. Don't let the unisex tag discourage you fellas. Alberto Morillas, the creator of this juice knew exactly what he was doing when he created this masterpiece intended for men that like to smell clean and for the ladies that appreciate a freshly showered man. It's a nice clean scent, would've loved it more if it was more intensed. For a real soapy fragrance, I would highly recommend Acqua di Parma: Colonia Essenza. Great soapy fragrance, fresh, clean and sharp. 
Performance is average with good projection for the first hour or so, I suggest spray your cloths, they carry the fragrance for many hours.
Notice it's a unisex fragrance. Sometimes i find it feminine. If you want to smell fresh and masculine, you have much better options.
I was able to buy an original mugler cologne (not the ""come together"" version) for about 50$ which in my opinion is expensive. It's in the Prada/Versace fresh fragrances price range. Steamy Cologne (Alberto Morillas, 2001)
Scentrack: Fun Lovin’ Criminals – Half a Block
Allegedly, the inspiration for this composition was a hotel bar of soap that Thierry Mugler brought from his trip in Morocco. I can sense that specific hotel cleanliness in Mugler Cologne, but this Morillas’ composition is much more than just another soap. In my opinion, Mugler Cologne in among the best composition inside a very rigid, and historically important cologne genre. Other two compositions I admire the most are Vettiveru by Comme des Garcons and l’Eau de Tarocco by Diptyque. 
Mugler Cologne is a fresh, extremely clean and genderless scent. The composition opens with strong citruses – piercing neroli, bergamot and balanced dose of chemically clean aldehydes. In the body there is a soapy note of white flowers, again a very clean bouquet. The base is made of laundry fresh musk. The special feature of Mugler Cologne is a clean, steamy note of hot iron. Like dressing up a fresh, clean shirt on a sunny morning. I believe that mysterious S-molecule is a Steam, not a Sex molecule of “post-coital liquids” what the rumors say. If you are looking for a happy, clean and reasonably priced cologne look no further. Simple and great stuff for a hot climates. 
P.S. The retro-futuristic packaging is great, like a part of Captain Kirk's bathroom.
Rating: 8/10 Soapy unisex freshness personified into a long lasting zingy ice clean scent. Being a big fan of 4711 I’d been looking for that freshness with longevity, this is it, but with a stronger soapy element. I have a bottle from 5 years ago, so not sure if it’s been reformulated. However, you can tell the structure is simple, so hard to imagine that would change in quality. Amazing lasting power for such a clean fragrance, Makes you smell clean no matter what you’ve been up to! A few years ago Creed would send out free samples of their products. I was sent a small decant of Original Vetiver and on the first spray, I was in love. A natural and refreshing fragrance that makes you feel clean and sophisticated. It took me a few years to finish the small decant so I could not justify the price of Creed. 
Mugler Cologne takes the place of Original Vetiver for me. It is more synthetic, doesn't seem to last as long, but still gives me that incredibly clean and fresh green profile I want. This is not a diss to Mugler Cologne, but rather what initially attracted me to it. Comparing the two, I see Mugler as more casual, which makes it even better for me.
For the price, this checks the box for a beautifully clean and soapy fragrance, which is odd because it is also synthetic at times. It almost becomes a scent that is your skin, if that makes sense. It is light but bold at the same time. 
I think this is a fragrance that everyone should smell. It is in its own world, especially regarding its history.
Overall: 6/10
EDIT: The more I wore this, the less I liked it. I keep getting a sharpness from this the whole way through. 
I actually sold it and have a bottle of my first love coming in (Original Vetiver). To me, they really don't compare in quality. OV is a lot nicer and richer on my skin, where MC lays sharp and linear. OV is just blended so well, it is impossible to beat.
Personally, I would shell out the extra cash and get something I love rather than like. I am slowly doing this with my little collection and trying to get it all down to loves. One of the best at what it is designed to do...make you smell clean and feel uplifted, whilst also uplifting those around you. I have to agree with the comment before me, it lasts for ages for such a clean fresh scent. It could be sold for a lot more, when considering the prices of freshies by MFK and Creeds, this could cost so much more yet it highly affordable (100% no brainer). 100% unisex. Genuinely a 10/10 fragrance. I'll let you in on a little secret....it lasts, a very long time. One of all time favorite go-tos. And probably the easiest perfume, to make a signature scent. So yea, the more you spray, the longer it lasts. And it doesnt cal for a gag reflex...its not heavy like that. Its sneaky heavy...and you'll get whiffs, ALL DAY LONG. I cant speak for some sort of recent reformulation. I have 10OZ bottle from several yrs ago. And it hangs in there, like an EDP would It smells very green like banana republic 78 vintage green and commodity bergamot. It’s good and clean but smells way more green than it does a bar of soap to me Better performance and same smell from Alexandria Sparkling Bergamont. 8+ hrs of heavy projection.
Original vetiver has very noticable differences from this. 
Neroli Portifino is a different smell all together.
Your welcome. Ordered from Amazon Germany what from the photo should have been the original Mugler Cologne and bottle, but instead I received the Mugler Cologne Come Together bottle. Unfortunately I was distracted and noticed this only after removing the celophane, opening the box, and seeing the bottle.
Used a couple of sprays on me to test it, and also applied on a kitchen paper towel, and left it on a book that has a plastic cover. This is a test I have done repeatedly on many fragrances to check their longevity (among the longest lasting I've tested so far: Bentley Absolute, and Dior Fahrenheit.)
I checked the smell on the paper towel for a few consecutive days. Amazingly, and to my surprise, I could still pick up the Come Together fragrance from the center of that paper towel after the second, third, and even fourth day.
The vendor contacted me because of my negative review on them. And even if I had removed the cellophane and used a couple of sprays, they were kind enough to accept the return and offer full refund. Because of this, I removed the negative review. The wrong photo is still there on Amazon.de though, but apparently it's something they have already asked Amazon to fix, and it's on Amazon's hands for quite some time already.
In any case, I then tried to order again the original Mugler Cologne from another Amazon market vendor hoping to get luckier, and luckily enough, this time I did the original and taller/slimmer Mugler Cologne bottle. 
Now I did the same sort of test, couple of sprays on the center of the exact same kind of paper towel, and leaving that paper towel resting on a book that has a plastic cover. After the first day already, I barely can pick up the scent from the center of the napkin. 
To me (again without comparing side-by-side, just from memory, which can be quite misleading) it seems to me the original is more natural smelling, fresher and lighter. Come Together might be longer lasting, but it seemed to me sharper, possibly less natural, more synthetic smelling.
Take these impressions with a huge grain of salt, since I am doing so myself. Would like to compare side-by-side but haven't been able to do that so far.
PS. Update couple of days later. Actually I can still pick up the scent of the original Mugler Cologne from center of the napkin. Still seems to me the Come Together was more noticeable after this number of days, but of course atomizer differences might play a role. Again side-by-side comparison would be ideal. I don't agree with the Original Vetiver comparisons. 
Tested the Thierry Mugler (OG formula) vs 2011 OV.. Mugler cologne is actually a bit soapier and smells nicer in the air.
You can actually smell some Vetiver in the Creed. I would say they share neighborhoods but they aren't even on the same street.
I own and like both. Fabulous spring/summer fragrance for anyone. If you don’t like citrus/white florals you won’t care for it. However if your a neroli lover like me this is great. Very refreshing. One of the best. A classic. My opinion is obviously in the minority here so do what you will with this. I ordered a decant of this specifically because there are so many glowing reviews of this fragrance here on Fragrantica. 
It is 55°F today with moderate humidity and one squirt of this stuff is screaming its way across my entire apartment. When so many people have described this as being soft or pleasing, I am absolutely shocked at how loud and in-your-face synthetic this fragrance is. I see so many reviewers say that this is their go to fragrance for hot summer days and I cannot imagine this in the heat and humidity. I started wearing fragrances in the 80s and I am not averse to powerhouse scents but they need to be made with quality ingredients and well-composed.
This is not a fragrance I hope to smell again on me or anyone else. I definitely think there is a place for clean, soapy, laundry fresh type of scents but Mugler Cologne is not this to my nose. It smells more like institutional-grade floor cleaner. It starts off smelling very close to creed OV opening and finishes smelling very close to neroli portifino dry down. Either way its a great fragrance at every stage. Very good quality and smooth smelling unlike a lot of muglers darker colognes. I get really good performance from this especially considering the type of scent it is. I think the s note is steam. It has a freshly steam ironed shirt feel which s lovely and clean. One of my go to spring scents. Citrus, soapy, grassy, musky, floral all wrapped in the creamiest cleanest vetiver. Today I am going to talk about Mugler Cologne.
A cologne, as its name indicates, very fresh and clean.
Mugler Cologne has nothing to do with the Mugler collection as an aroma as it is the freshest of all and nothing invasive.
It opens with a scent of neroli and bergamot, it also contains 3 more notes that I do not know much but I suppose they must smell very good because the mixture is really nice 😍
I always use it after the shower in spring and summer, when you need to feel fresh.
A moderate sillage and longevidad of 4 hours or so.
Its price is really cheap! I like it a lot! Beautiful! I just tried this for the first time today. It opens with bergamot and a touch of soap and quickly dries down to a soft, grassy, vetivery dream. I know the notes didn't promise this but with that radioactive color I was halfway expecting it to smell like Mountain Dew (which TBH would have been amazing). I was pleasantly surprised by how soft and natural it smells. Nice find! Mugler cologne has grew on me and now it's one of my favorite soapy, floral fragrances, This fragrance makes me smile and happy about how beautiful life is. It's very upliftin. It has a beautiful aroma and whenever people smell it on you, They wanna get closer. Beautiful fragrance. Was looking for soapy/clean scent. Lots of posts mentioned Mugler Cologne. I smelled Creed Vetiver in store. Researched Creed Vetiver online and they compared Mugler Cologne to it.
So, blind bought Mugler Cologne. Fits the bill. I have a sample of Creed Vetiver.
I'm no expert, so the way I would describe the differences are that sniffing straight from the bottle, Mugler really smells like soapy water, while Creed smells only slightly different...like you can tell it's a cologne.
When on my skin, the vetiver is slightly stronger with Creed, still soapy but sharper, while Mugler comes out just nice and clean and softer. Creed Vetiver lasts longer on skin but with the vetiver slightly more noticeable later,
But Mugler was fine too...about 4 hours before became skin scent....sprayed some on my undershirt, and still scent on it afternoon at office.
I also blind bought Al Haramain Portfolio Neroli Canvas. Also a nice clean soapy scent. The neroli comes out stronger on that, but it lasts longer than Creed or Mugler.
The true-est soap scent between the three, to me, is Mugler Cologne....nice soft/fresh/watery/shower-clean scent. Some scents start out as something else, then in the dry down some people describe them as soapy. Mugler Cologne makes no bones about it. Soap/clean/fresh from beginning to end. I just wish it lasted longer.
Funny comparison : I think you could spray Mugler on yourself 10 times, and people would think you are just really clean smelling and spilled some soap on your clothes, but if you spray Creed 10 times, people would think you showered, then put on a soapy cologne. I smelled it and bought a bottle. I loved the freshness of it and find it unisex, I wore it a few times though. To my nose it smells mostly neroli with a thick oily smell. I don't exactly know how to describe this oily side :). It works best in very warm weather. Mugler Cologne is a taker if you want a fresh perfume in summer whether you're a an or a woman. This cologne made me then recognize the neroli note in perfumes, so I guess if you're a néroli lover, you won't get disappointed. More than just soap! Mugler Cologne has plenty of layers. First there is a fresh, green, translucent neroli. Then there is a stroooong petitgrain, adding a sharp neon greenness to the scent. It almost smells like freshly snapped foliage. Green green green green. The drydown has the most captivating skin-musk I've smelled in a long time. It's almost like salty skin, very fresh and warm, but not like laundry or any generic soapy skin smell.
Mugler Cologne smells oddly organic and real, which is unusual for Muglers as they are generally some level of otherworldly synthetic. For example, Alien's jasmine is synth-y, and A*Men has that rubbery asphalt. It's unisex, maybe leaning feminine as the neroli is prominent. The newer version does not last as long as my older bottle, which lasts all day long with a single spritz. I absolutely love this. It's clean and fresh but definitely more on the masculine side. It's very green with a citrus hint and musk. Doesn't have amazing lasting power but it would be good as a gym scent or something to throw on after swimming maybe. Or just a nice summer scent on a really hot day The orange blossom is very evident and cancels out the bergamot, making the high point of the fragrance be the ability to isolate both aspects of the orange blossom, that is, the floral-fruity (neroli) and the most intense green (petitgrain). Unfortunately, however, for a minimalist fragrance with few notes, green and supposedly natural, the aroma is more artificial than it should be - even for designer standards, and this was clearly compensated by making it excessively soapy, which disharmonized the well-constructed orange blossom. Ppl say it served as the basis for copying by Creed with ""Original Vetiver"". Good performance. My go to scent for dropping the kids off at kindergarten, it's clean and gets you noticed by the yummy mummies. It smells like a lemony soap to me. It's clean and fresh. Not offensive at all unless you think smelling fresh and clean is offensive I guess lol. 
Seems like a bright fragrance to me. It is a lighter scent and doesn't linger too long. 
Definitely like Creeds Original Vetiver minus the hints of wood and longevity, also didn't start off as intensely green as Creed OV but the dry down is similar. Very nice all around fragrance! I agree with other reviews! Fresh, clean and soapy! Citrus opening and very similar to Creed Original Vetiver. Personally after that I find it a little bit more feminine than Creed Original Vetiver. Clean, fresh soapy vibe. A crowd pleaser and good performer in the moderate to high heat. Luxurious bar of soap nails this one to a tee. If you want a great all round spring summer frag that's a dumb reach, gym bag or even a car freshener, pick this baby up. Definitely in my top 5 and one of a handful of fragrances I can say I love wearing. 
I grew up In Arizona, and back in the day, Arizona was known for its citrus groves and each spring you could smell the orange blossoms, especially at night. The smell always made me happy as did spring. This takes me back to those days due to the neroli in this.
I’m very big on masculine's and this is far from it. It's neither masculine or femiine. It's just clean and fresh. This is my dumb reach above all others. 
I enjoy how Mugler Cologne makes me feel. So few fragrances can do what this does to me, that is to say it makes me feel motivated, happy and inspired. This does that extremely well. It is a very energizing fragrance that makes me feel good about myself. So if you are looking for a fragrance that plays on your mood, do NOT sleep on this. 
Now I don’t get the whole soapy thing. On me it smells like a cologne, not soap. This smells like it has Vetiver in it, but it does not, perhaps it’s the petitgrain ? The neroli and apparently, petitgrain, play very well together. I wear this year around and for any and all occasions.
This is also great for everyday use or the office. 
Respray about every 4 hours, 2 to 4 sprays. On that note, the opening is incredible, so respraying is a highlight of this fragrance.
10 out of 10. Perfection for me.
UPDATE: I found an amazing clone of this. It's called Unbreakable Love. It is a unisex frag and man are they very similar. I picked a bottle up for $15. Unbeatable if you can't find Mugler Cologne or don't want to pay the $40 +. Zero longetivity and projection. Great scent if you just want to smell 'nice' and very 'clean' This will not offend people. According to my tester:
A subtle alchemy of intimate and sensual notes, a strong but familiar scent, the ultimate feeling of freshness... MUGLER COLOGNE awakens the senses and sensuality. The opening is citrus, sweet, and vetiver (vetiver smells like grass to me). Then vetiver and a tad spicy on the dry down. If you like vetiver, this is for you. I don't personally like vetiver because it smells like grass to me. Great choice if you're looking for a lightweight vetiver based scent. A slight step down from Creed Original Vetiver. Still outstanding. Clean, fresh and soapy. Everyone should have this in their collection. Best decant to have at the office. Especially after a 12hr day. Great way to freshen up.
8/10 The definition of cleanliness.
Back in the days, Mugler was in Morocco. An hotel's bar of soap hitted his mind during his travel. With Morillas, he made it a fragrance.
Cologne was born.
Addictive and sensual. IMO mugler cologne is the younger brother of creed original vetiver which is more suitable for summer while creed is for spring. Soapy. What is in fact the soapy smell these days? There has been an entire generation showering with AXE or some other brand competing with AXE and it comes to the point where soapy doesn’t mean the same to most as it means to me (42yrs old) as it does to the age where fragrance companies are try to marketing to. 
Time to start classifying this by it’s note breakdown I went to the fragrance department in search of Chanel No 19 Poudree. The girl from the Mugler counter stopped me and asked if I was looking for something specific. I told her and she begged me to try the Mugler Cologne first.. and OMG am I ever glad she did!
It didn't stop me from buying the Chanel, but I found another fragrance to love... and I think I might love it even more than the Chanel. They're really only comparable in the sense that they're fresh and green, so it's not like having one means you don't need the other.
Mugler Cologne is so clean and fresh. I can't stop smelling my wrists whenever I wear it. It might be the most beautiful soapy fragrance I've ever come across. It's so well done. The citrus isn't overpowering. The floral is neutral enough to keep it unisex. It really is exquisite... and that's saying a lot from me, because I'm not even a huge fan of green scents Love this. You get exactly what you pay for. A clean, fresh fragrance that is perfect for when you want to freshen up. Or any time you want to grab a cologne in passing to make you smell clean.
If this is a fragrance you choose to get, for this price, you get exactly that. What you won't get is exceptional performance, although it performs better than I initially expected. I get a good few hours out of it and decent project. That does require 6 sprays or so though. And some help from a little bodylotion.
It's fresh, clean, nice. It smells really good. It is perfect for its purpose. It is nothing remarkable or exceptional and wasn't meant to be.
Perfectly created fragrance given what it was meant to be at an affordable price. If you like to have a ""let me just freshen up a bit"" fragrance in your collection, give this one a try. I am sorry to say this and I hope I don’t offend everyone that loves this, but in my opinion this has been uber hyped by Youtubers. Nothing really special to me, it goes away really quick, and the citrus and neroli are not strong enough for hot summer days. I’m not saying this is a bad cologne, I just think it has been hyped too much. If you want a good soapy smell, try Prada Amber Pour Homme. 
Don’t let my review sway your decision, guys. It’s just my own opinion and doesn’t represent the majority here. It’s not bad....not great either. Toned down Creed Original Vetiver fragrance. Quite nice but doesn't last as long as OV. IMO its worth spending the extra money for Creed purely for the longevity. Otherwise, I'd keep it at the office for a freshen up. I love this scent. The best neroli ever. It’s 10/10 and slightly old school. The sad thing is that it’s pretty weak, so use it as a pick-me-up or freshener. One of the most subtle colognes you'll find. 
Cologne for people who don't wear cologne.
An absolute love.
Got the 10oz bottle. Came with two nozzles. One for spraying (which arrived broken) and one for....I believe the verb is splashing? (sorry, English is my first language, and my worst language). So I splash.
I splash, I smell, I love. In that order. My favorite citrus based perfume. It is bright, fresh, clean and green! Love this frag and that thought will never change. I think the longevity is decent lasting about 4 hours. Wish it lasted much longer. I got my bottle today. I am in a mission to compare neroli fragrances. This one is very lovely. It is not a dupe for TF Neroli Portofino, it is lighter but at the same time has that nice French whispering nature, not loud like NP. Drydown is very delicate and even mood lifting. I really like it! Cant wait hot weather to start using it. my only complaint the total absence on me of white musk
fabulous on my denim jacket
_pure soap
the closure reminds a lot of a plumbing fitting or something like that 
_fantastic This is a simple fragrance that does its job very well. It has 3 easily identifiable parts to it: citrus (bergamot), white floral (neroli), and musk (white/clean). The musk is powerful, which is why I imagine people associating it with soap.
This actually lasts pretty long, and the projection is stronger than I expected. No need to go overboard with sprays, 2-3 are sufficient. Very nice and clean smell. Somehow it really lasts on my skin. I like the drydown the most, it reminds me of a combo of Lacoste Booster from 1996 and Neroli Portofino. Brings back great memories! This was not love at first sniff. I’m still on the fence about this one. It takes at least 4-6 sprays. People have mentioned an aquatic fishy smell. They aren’t wrong, it’s definitely there..but it doesn’t keep me from spraying it in my body. This is the fragrance you pull out when it’s 95-105 degrees F in Missouri with 80% humidity. It’s not cloying by any means. First smelled this when staying at a resort in Mexico where they had Mugler cologne body wash, shampoo, and lotion in the room. I bought a bottle as soon as I returned from vacation. It's very bright and refreshing. I definitely get the Irish Spring vibe I've heard others mention. Great fragrance for hot weather that is perfectly unisex. Great someone cologne Mugler Cologne is perhaps the most ""one-size-fits-all"" of any scent I've encountered. It could match any gender, any age, any season, any occasion. I liken it to a traditional cologne that's traveled to the future, only to come back and brighten the present. It contains the components of a staid, upright cologne, but everything's been coated in a synthetic, futuristic sheen. Come for the top notes; stay for the musk dry-down. *It's to-die-for.* nice scent, true reminds the 4711 but I'd say JV artisan pure is closer 4711 and Mugler cologne reminds artisan pure than 4711. at the dry down mugler cologne and JV artisan pure are almost identical Imagine someone is mowing a grass near your home. That's the way it smells. Clean, unisex , fresh grass with some flower notes. Thats all I need for hot sunny days.
Unfortunately ,longevity is 2-3 hours Clean, soft, safe, unisex...best fragnance for hot days..end of story. Smells exactly like a piece os bar of soap!!! Traditional ok bar of soap! Clean earthy slightly woody. Performance is below good. You gonna smell clean fresh outa shower. Compliments are poor . Great choice for extremely summer heats . If you’re into soapy fragrances then this one is your love Very smooth soapy frag.
moderate performance and longevity. 1hrs soft projection and then 3 more hrs very weak projection and skin scent, I also spray my clothes.
Perfect hot weather cologne, I can overspray it.
It was good, but not for me. it impresses me at first.
But at this price range(also not easy to find in my country), I have other cologne that I like better.
Rating: 7.25/10(great hot temp cologne) Mugler certainly got the ""ordinary soap"" down. This is a very unofensive fresh scent that is completely unisex.
I was gifted one of the big bottles with the TM embossed in the glass, no label.
It's so light and airy that there's almost nothing to it. But it just sort of hangs out and dances around you. Really great when it's simply too hot to wear anything else. Also completely appropriate for gym or any other occasion where strong scents are a no-no.
I can picture this as the signature of the no-nonsense professional who buys the biggest bottle despite the fact it has to be applied two-handed, simply because they abhor shopping and are determined not to buy a bottle more than once a year! 
Another I'll give to hubs, just because it's more of a ""men's"" scent and something I think he might like, though it honestly might be too weak for him. If so, I'll be happy to keep it as my afternoon refresh spray or after-shower spray.
It's a like for me, dawg. this is clinging interminably to my skin, as in: the cologne that just wouldn't go away. ack. i thought i liked it at first, but on second thought: just no. Interesting green and sweet soap <3
Perfect fragrance for soap lovers like me! Finally got my hands on this one. After being unimpressed by A*Men Pure Havane and Pure Malt, in part due to seasonal inappropriateness, I can finally preach a little about something from Mugler I do happen to like.
A quick note about my biases on Morillas -- I started with Acqua di Gio at a young age and I do consider him to be a superstar parfumier, to the point of his works being too popular to the point of unfashionability (sic). If Morillas did it, chances are, it's an over-marketed, over-hyped fragrance. Easy to steer clear of for someone such as myself, who is searching for fragrances that aren't very well known. I don't like smelling like anybody else. That is just me.
Yet, enter Mugler Cologne, which I have no real problems with. It's a designer, yet isn't widely used, and the scent is very agreeable. The lore is cute and unpretentious and the result is what everyone tends to say it is: clean, soapy, mostly inoffensive, and easy to wear.
It seems perfect for anybody who is restrained about the projection they emit with heavy fragrances, be it a personal choice, culture, or what have you. This is up there with Molecule 01. Not because it doesn't project, but because the scent itself is, as I said, very agreeable.
Seems excellent for hot days, as I intend to be my use case for it. 
To address the seasonality votes, or the rating here on Fragrantica, I'd say Spring/Summer is spot on, and I do agree, such a simple scent might not ""deserve"" a 4.3, but I do think it's worthy of the hype. Clean scents are kind of underrated a category. 
This review is off the back of my hand. I will know if the scent is intoxicating (in a bad way) if sprayed multiple times and for a day out in humid and hot weather. I can detect that, for the wearer, the scent might get headache inducing, but maybe that's just right now because I keep sniffing it. After owning 2 bottles of Creed OV, I decided not to buy again and to replace them with this fragrance. People complain about longevity, but it is nose fatigue. I can smell this very long and I think I prefer this fragrance over OV. So clean, so fresh and so cheap! Love it! What can I say...Summer in a bottle. Fresh and sexy! You will love it. I get an old man vibe from this. I really wanted this to be the easy to wear clean scent that everyone says it but just smells like my grandpa rest his soul. Versace Eau Fraiche became what I wanted this to be The perfect freshie and and the best dumb reach i own I just scored a vintage 2.6oz bottle of this for $4.49 at the thrift store yesterday. Yay. I'm a fan of green so the bottle attracted me and having no other info about the frag, tried it on. The opening is more masculine, citrus, sea salt and cedar or cypress, to my nose. Wonder what the secret S ingredient is? In the middle, it started to smell like pistachio, which I love and reminded me of Bvlgari Omni Green Jade. Go figure. The drydown 4 hours later finally gave me a soft clean floral and that made me happy. I could still smell it on my wrist this morning so longevity is good on me. It's sweltering summer here in Texas so I plan to wear this a lot. I think it's a good unisex cologne. And yes, I'm female. A perfect hot Summer day cologne. Smooth citrus and florals. Longevity and silage moderate. Lovely after a cool shower on a hot day - like today here in Lancashire. I received a healthy decant of this and went in with low expectations; hence why I am so pleasantly surprised.
This is an extremely clean, citrusy soapy DNA. It has wonderful clean top notes that is your quintessential out of the shower vibe. I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did. This is not a knock on this, but it has the same vibe as one of my favorite Summer aftershaves...Citrus Musk by Clubman. The dry down bring musk up to the forefront which added to the fragrance. Overall, extremely pleasant DNA you can spray liberally with.
Longevity was about 5/6 hours before it came a super close skin scent. First hour had decent projection. My wife commented had great I smelled when I walked into the room.
I voted “love” instead of “like” because of my perceived value here. For the fresh out of the shower genre, this is a HUGE value for money. It’s so inexpensive per ml, it’s hard not to own this. I must agree with the last reviewer,
Not worth the 4.28 rating. 
I have it for 3 years but everytime I use it with hot weather, I feel sorry for wasting the oppurtunity of using a (much) better Neroli/Bergamot/(Petigrain)based fragrance. I have plenty of them and they are all better than this one.
And if it is the soapy accord you're looking for, unless you have a magnified nose, you will be disappointed for there is none. Better go for a Acqua di Parma colonia. Assoluta,Essenza, Intensa. those are soapy. Or Prada Amber.
If it is the soapy Musk accord that you like, than you really should try Kiehl's original musk.
Also the performance is average at best, even for these type of fragrances.
My guess is both Mugler and Alberto Morillas are both (highly) overrated. nothing overly special just another freshie its nice clean fresh out the shower feel good vibes lay down and relax this is how this makes me feel :) I don't know if this is marketed as mens or unisex but I'm a woman and i love this. Its an EDT but I find the longetivity pretty decent. It has a really refreshing smell with a slight musky undertone. A great summer day fragrance as it is not too overbearing I dont like Mugler. Angel was a truly disgusting chemical quagmire that sold on hype.There is a comment somewhere on Fragrantica from a young lady that says ""it smells like my local dump but I love it in a strange way"" That reminds me of the Danny Kaye film ""The Kings New Clothes"" Only the little child can see the truth.
However I have to say this Cologne is absolutely fantastic. Apart from its gorgeous fresh grassy minty smell it evokes memories of going to the barbers shop as a child and smelling from the bottles of splash on that were fashionable in their day.
Enough said, this gem is highly rated here but looks like its already discontinued. Its as scarce as hens teeth. If you can find a bottle snap it up. Why oh why do they discontinue Colognes such as this. It makes no sense whatsoever. Just requested a sample of this from Mugler & was told that it’s now being called, “Come Together.” The bottle size is also changing to 3.3 ounces, so now you get one less ounce for your dollar. This company can’t seem to leave well enough alone when it comes to fragrances. This has MINT as base note and still no issues with longetivity... Only mugler can crack this...
Cologne stands different like other muglers...
Opening - citrus-vetiver
Middle - some floral comes
Final- mint + vetiver+ floral...
No Woody notes..no sweetness and very fresh scent lingers...
Soapy ? 
Yes surely...but we like the scent of some soaps..don't we? :) My favorite gym cologne - Irish spring vibe, sporty, grassy (but not sour), fresh, soapy clean, manly and versatile. Guys check this one out. They need to make a woman's version of this for feminine ladies that don't want to smell manly. Perhaps increase the neroli and add a touch of white floral. That would smell so sexy on a woman. A scent with a proeminent unisex quality; A soapy base complemented by an all-encompassing green feeling, as well as the zestiness of fresh lime (bergamot). 
This scent will make you feel fresh out of the shower, half a day long. 
All that's left to do is know wether you like the soapy foundation or not.
Projects for around 1 hour and then sits close to the skin for 4 more hours. Influenced by my frugality, I was so excited to have many people tell me to try less expensive Mugler in place of Creed's Original Vetiver. Well, don't believe it. Both are ""clean"" scents, but the similarity stops there. You get vetiver with COV, not with Mugler. And Mugler suffers from weak longevity and sillage issues. Mugler is listed as ""...for women and men."" Well, here's some proof that Mugler is more for the former. After I'd sprayed some on, my wife say,""I like that one. It's clean, nice."" I state I don't care for it and she chimes in, ""give the rest to me."" Done. This is just so damn good it’s my girlfriends favorite and probably mine too. I love petitgrain notes, and with the musk mixing with the green petitgrain it reminds me of popsicle sticks after you eat the popsicle and smell the wooden stick. Just a soapy, relaxed, soft (not very sharp) citrus fragrance. It's like a bar soap you've probably smelled many times. Sounds cliche but it's the epitome of ""out of the shower clean"".
It's a great dumb reach for the spring/summer. Great for casual wear and work.
Lasts anywhere from 4-6 hours with decent projection for a couple hours.
SCORE: 4 out of 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Finally got my nose on this. This is the definition of a relaxed summer. It gives of that chilling vibe the same as Dior Homme Cologne and Ferrari Bright Neroli. Easy blind buy if you like these kind of scents. Cheap and a lot of value in every single ml. P.S. it reminds in a way a cologne my barber used to have in the 00's. Brings back a lot of memories personally.. Smells very fresh, soapy and green. Similar to Philosophy Pure Grace, but more grassy and less flowery. A great everyday fragrance for both men and women. I've been having this one for a long time but recently i received a decant of Chanel Chance with another purchase and man ... the opening is almost identical. At least in the first minute I would be unable to tell the difference. Just starting off by letting you know this review is from a woman who wears Mugler Cologne. 
Mugler Cologne is the freshest, happiest spring/summer scent I've ever had the pleasure of smelling. The opening is gorgeous and I could just keep spraying and spraying it just for the opening. It's fresh and so not screechy or loud that I can spray it all over. I spray it on my neck, hair, arms, clothes...oh dear lord I just want to jump inside a bottle of it! 
Just for a short moment as the notes transition, it sort of has a bug spray smell. I was like, ""Whoa...hold up!"" I was getting worried there for a minute, but it gradually kept changing into a gorgeous green fresh cut grass with a tiny hint of musk and (I'm sure) the S note. Beautiful! Just beautiful! 
It doesn't take long at all before Mugler Cologne turns into a soft skin scent as far as me being able to smell it on myself. No worries though, I promise you will leave a trail behind you which is what happened to me. I had sprayed it several hours before I went shopping at a clothing department store and a woman sniffed me out from the beautiful fragrance trail I was leaving. She quickly approached me awkwardly laughing (thought I was going to have to do some judo/taekwondo moves or punch her LOL) as she said to her friend, ""I found it! I found the one who has it on!"" Then she said ""I've been following this perfume all over the store. What do you have on if I may ask? It is beautiful!"" With my hand clutching my heart I breathlessly told her what it was (with wild eyes and a smile of coarse).
I bought Mugler Cologne because of all the raving reviews but I was a little concerned about the weak sillage. I had just received the EDT only a few days prior to my shopping stalker experience, lol but I was thrilled to learn the sillage was good and people could still smell it around three hours into me wearing it. 
In my opinion don't be afraid to blind buy this.
Edit: My husband and I are now fighting over this bottle of Mugler Cologne.Haha! He literally hid it from me and I've searched everywhere. He says I have plenty of perfumes...this one is his! I guess I'll be buying a new bottle sooner than I expected to Holy bergamot Batman. Man this comes right out with a heavy sour bergamot note front and center. Behind that I get a green, grassy note. Kind of like fresh cut grass but I also got some in my mouth on accident. I'm not so sure about this one. So strange. I could see it being unisex, but I don't personally feel I'd want to wear it. Seems I'm in the minority by not raving about it, and I LOVE citrus. It feels more like eating the bitter white part of the orange than the juicy orange part. Perhaps I need to smell it on a clean man to truly appreciate it. Any guesses as yo what the secret ""S"" note is? I'm guessing it is a modern synthetic of some kind? Like Ambroxan, Cashmeran, Timberol or the like? Smells like a good bar of soap. Very nice fragrance for summer. Elegant and natural smelling. My husband likes, my father-in-law likes. 
Thumbs up! Top cologne! Very good indeed! Intense fresh green soap followed by a humble vetiver/grassy dimension. The opening is like what many say...straight out of a hot shower; steamy, fresh, clean vibe. The drydown is warm grass on a breezy summer's day. Reminds me of the south of France. Robust longevity, sillage and projection - lasts 8 hours, projects well and no doubt lingers. Delightful! Looking forward to upcoming Spring to wear this green soapy fresh masculine cologne. Smells like you just freshly showered with Irish Spring Soap after pumping iron at the gym. Reminds me very much of a greenish scented shaving cream you get at the barbershop after a wet shave. The wife said this is too much like a guys Irish Spring shower gel... So this one is all for me fellas! @pierreelkhoury
The bottle above is 300ml bottle.
100ml looks a bit different: tall, slim and with no name on it. A Neroli and Bergamot Bomb
SOTD: Mugler Cologne: As of 01/24/19
Like fresh green leaves after a rainstorm, that's how described this fragrance, my nose detects the Neroli, Bergamot and the Orange flower in the opening and then on the dry down 
more of the Neroli, Bergamot, and Musk. Getting that bitter orange vibe as well from the Orange flower, Bergamot and Petitgrain. Excellent release from the Mugler house. To me probably one of the best fresh fragrance currently. All the notes are blended well. Excellent scent for the summer and as well an office scent. Definitely a must have.
Scent: 8.5/10
Design/Presentation: 9/10
Value: 7/10
Longevity/Performance: 8.52/10: Lasted on my skin/skin scent around between 8-10+ hrs
Overall: 8.25/10
My 2nd wearing of this fragrance as my office SOTD of the day as of 03/12/19, did not get any compliment which to me no worries I wear my fragrances in my collection to adore and love it's capabilities to it's full potential of the scent/fragrance. Neroli is one of my many favorite note(s) , I still put there with being on my top freshie spring/summer fragrances in my collection and rotation. Just love the Neroli with the mixture of bergamot and petitgrain being well blended. Longevity/Performance remains the same 8.25 out of 10, 9-11 sprays lasted on my skin as a skin scent around 9+ hrs. And my overall score will remain the same on this fragrance cause I'm putting Bright Neroli ahead of this fragrance which is 8.25 out of 10. It will be in my spring/summer rotation for 2019. T+0min - ~0.1mL applied to wrist. Pleasantly sharp, sour, bitter, citric bergamot and neroli. Reminds me of citrus zest and pith with fresh bitter green leaves. Very bright.
T+5min - already less citric, just smells like bitter greens. So bright and fresh. Smell is strong and clear from 3"" distance, light airy wafts from 9"" distance.
T+20min - the bitter greens are taking on a slight soapiness. I wouldn't say it smells like soap exactly but I get the comparison.
T+1h - still able to smell it very clearly from 3"". Sometimes I catch airy wafts easily from 9"" and sometimes I have to get closer.
T+2h - can smell it from 3"" clearly, it's getting lighter.
T+2.5h - can smell it from 1"" away, pretty much a skin scent at this point.
Very linear after the first 5-20 minutes, but that's not at all a bad thing as it's so lovely, bright and airy. Seems nice for popping out for quick errands in the summertime. Tried this years ago and didn't think much of it but kept the bottle. Broke it out again this spring and summer to try it again and loved it. Wore it alot this past summer. I will always keep this cause it's just such a simple reach you don't have to think about. Especially when you're not sure what to wear this is always a safe bet. 
Like has been said a million times, clean, soapy, fresh green scent. On me doesn't have the greatest projection or longevity but u can always respray and not worry about overkill with this one.
Also got my 84 yr old dad to break away from his trusty ""old spice"" he has worn ever since it was invented, and he loves this and wears only this now. Def keeping this ""for life""
Believe it or not, this is actually my MOST COMPLIMENTED SCENT EVER. I got compliments from my colleagues from work, friends, my parents, and even from my older brother which is super rare. 
I remember taking the elevator right after I applied the cologne and a chef walks in and she straight up says ""HMMMMMM SOMEONE SMELLS GOOOOOD"" not knowing the scent was coming from me.
Only knock with the scent is the performance, it's just average 4-6 hour but w the scent like this who cares.
I recommend everyone this as a ""spray and go"" scent, if you just want to smell like ""you literally came out of the shower"" this is the perfect one. Don't be surprised if you're getting compliments, this scent is mass appealing but is so unique and different at the same time.
In 3 words: clean, unique, attractive 
5/5 always gonna have this in my collection This one was my wife's gift for Valentine's day 2014. We were at a hotel in Paris on a trip and every time I wear it I'm instantly reminded of Paris. Fresh ,light herbal and soapy , not exactly what Paris would smell like but memories and scents are intertwined I guess. Honestly, it's a great scent. Please go with the larger size because you will wear a lot of this! The 3.4 oz ran out after about two months during the summer! 
Very fresh and pleasant! Great for those really hot days or in the spring time! 
I'll definitely be using this for years to come! This is okay and it does what it sets out to. It's bright, citrusy and very soapy. But honestly, it feels like you're just spraying pleasant smelling soap on yourself. 
Nothing special, but not bad. 6.5/10
Love you NAB The notes should equal and automatic love for me. However, this is a light, almost imperceptible scent, without any particularly nice or intriguing notes. I prefer the Cologne from Etat Libre d'Orange. Blossom by Gunning King It's greeeeen! You can smell the freshness, nearly basil... summer flowers... 
Beautifully made. I get the similarity to Creed Original Vetiver, but it's different. Brighter and slightly fresher and warmer at the same time, but not sweet at all.
Mugler is often in the spotlight for its Angel/A*men series, with which Mugler pioneered the ""gourmand"" fragrances. Too bad these are shadowing other Mugler's creations, and I think that this Cologne deserves much more attention given its singularity at that price point.
A big weakness though: its performance. Indeed, after spraying, it quickly fades into a skin scent and will be totally gone after a couple of hours (I applied ~20sprays in double layer). I like it, but glad I paid just ~$60 for a 10oz bottle.
Still, merci Thierry!
All ages, summer days Fresh out of the shower. Smells like an expensive soap and it works perfectly in hot weather or when you only want to smell fresh and clean.
I see some people compaining about performance, What do you expect from a soapy fragrance? To project like One Million? Freshness and citrus blast in a bottle. A scent full of summer, drinks and light. Silage and longevity is moderate. Wonderful and very much alive. I like it a lot for spring and summertimes at Beach og at the patio.Not uniique or a masterpiece, but a solid and reliable. Mugler never fails me. DOESNT SMELL LIKE IRISH SPRINGS SOAP!! I had to get that out of the way first. I literally blind bought this based on reviews saying it smelled like Irish Springs soap. I’m not going to lie it does have a soapy quality, but only in the dry down. It opens with a citrus blast. To me I get a shaving cream smell from it. Kind of like lime scented Barbasol. The fragrance does smell good and clean. I can see this worn on a nice spring/summer day. Blind buy,but I knew I'm gonna like it....man,how I was right!Phenomenal juice!I don't know what better can ANY niche house offer to beat this(citrus based) fragrance,at any price point!They should be 5 times better,and they're not,because simply it's not possible.It was released in 2001.,and I wonder,where the hell I was all these years,not knowing how great this fragrance was.I like fresh,inoffensive scents,that are easy to wear,and this is all about it.Green,citrus juice,soap(not soapy)nothing outdated or barbershop(you won't smell like the old man)...it is easily unisex,maybe a little bit more on a feminin side,maybe,but any man can pull this thing off.I've purchased recently a couple of new scents,but non of them thrilled me like this one,instantly.I haven't checked longevity yet,but as a citrus based fragrance,I know it can't be a monster,but the way it smells is just amazing.I'm so happy that I blindly(many research on net though)bumped on such a great creation.
.......
I realy enjoyed the scent during a couple of days of wearing,but the longevity kills me in a bad way.It should be reaplied during the day,and I hate so much when I have to do that.Nevertheless,I haven't changed my mind about how beautiful scent it is. This is fresh and green, but weak as well. Nothing thrilling, just hype. This is very clean, fresh and green.
I totally get the soapy scent, but it's the scent of a good luxurious soap. A bit spicy, quite unisex. No sweetness. A bit more on the masculine side, but light and easy-going.
Smells expensive and elegant.
I like it very much. Buy this classic gem now! I just picked up the ""original"", 300 MLS, on FragranceNet for $70. The reformulated ""Come Together"" is not as balanced and turns bitter in the dry down... seems to be missing the neroli and bergamot in the original. I live in Texas, if you are in an ultra-hot climate this is a must, a perfect HOT summer scent. Get the original while you still can! a Green fresh clean soapy perfume! Very very inoffensive with good longevity. It smells like a lemon, flowers while you walking trough a camp of parsley! very goodto create that athmosphere while you are waling trough the nature in spring/summertime. STRONG scent. You may think that just because it's a ""freshie"" and has a similar scent profile to Irish Spring soap or Creed's Original Vetiver, that it would be a light spring/summer scent.
Well, it's definitely for spring/summer but it ain't weak. Honestly, you CANNOT wear this to the office if you spray yourself more than 2 times. I made that mistake (I say mistake because I work in a ""scent-free"" office) and when I entered the kitchen, my co-workers could smell me like 5 meters away. Now I will only use this when I know I'm going to be outside or in an expansive indoor venue like a mall.
One more thing: On my skin, this smells different than on a paper or sniffing it from the atomizer. The musk is more pronounced on my skin AND there is a slight spiciness that comes out. So if you are worried that all you'll get is Irish Spring soap, don't be. Blind buy. Strong scent just like most Mugler scents. I was attracted by the greenness which is what it is, a green citrus scent. It did give me a headache though so I have not touched it for the longest time. I did receive compliments when I used it. This is a GOD tier, clean, sensual fragrance, and the standard for unisex imo. I must not be a fan of petitgrain, because everything I've sampled with that note, I don't like...that being said, I get why some enjoy this I have always seen the hype around this fragrance and wondered how soapy can a smell be?
I got a bottle of this fragrance and it's literally soap in liquid form. The fragrance smells extremely fresh and soapy. 
It will remind you of a green herbal soap. 
The problem with this as everyone mentioned is the longevity and sillage. Mugler Cologne last for 3 hours on my skin and projected for maybe an hour.
This comes in at a very affordable price range and makes it good for the gym or casual outing.
Longevity - 4/10
Sillage - 4/10
Scent - 8/10
Overall - 5/10
If you don't mind spraying through out the day and want to smell like you just came out of the shower, this is the fragrance for you. This has got to be the cleanest freshest green citrus fragrance ever! It has a very refreshing natural bitterness and I can't imagine anyone disliking it. I would compare it to Dior Eau Sauvage Cologne flanker, but it's much cheaper, less synthetic smelling and has also some traces of that old world soapy citrus fragrance vibe like in Acqua di Parma Colonia. You could say it's like a cleaned up and modernized version of the latter.
***
Of course, no danger of overspraying for the scent profile as well as for the performance. 6 sprays from a decant sprayer, and 15 minutes later, my GF had to dig her nose into my shirt to smell anything. There was some projection in the first hour, but after that, it became a skin scent, and at the 4 hour mark, the scent seemed to have vanished except for some faint traces on clothes practically indistinguishable from the smell of the fabric. So, you probably have to spray a bit more, and then there would not be much difference price wise with Dior Eau Sauvage Cologne (which performs better and needs less application). But scent wise, it has more bitterness and less sourness, which seems to make it more realistic. A great freshener for those hot sweaty days. Cooling and inoffensive. Smells a little on the feminine side and doesn't last long but at this price you can go to town on the reapplications. Irish Spring soap in a bottle. I got an easy 8-12 hours of performance from this fragrance. This cologne really blossoms and performs in humid environments. I would comfortably use 6-12 sprays when I used it a couple of years ago while traveling through SE Asia for a few months. It smells like a bar of soap for an hour then disappears! Nothing more, nothing less. Have you guys seen that new Cologne line coming out soon?
My dream is Parfum version of Mugler's Cologne or proper EDT.
Stoked! I finally got my beauty in the mail 
It truly is a slightly green,aromatic, slightly citrusy,slightly soapy masterpiece.
Perfect for casual wear spring and summer
It will not offend, is not daring , but smells quality and full for a aromatic, which I love to find
I recommend this over the molecule series and is a real step up from Lucky you by LC
4 to 6 hours and fair projection and some good sillage It really smells like soap, if you like the smell of it good for you.
For me it feels like you took a shower and forgot to washout the soap, not very clean is it ? A fresh and clean aromatic that smells full. This is not overly soapy, it just smells clean and is not dominated by neroli
Overall this is a perfect causal scent that a little refined and will never offend.
It is lovely to have a fragrance that not only has some nice citrus,helps you feel clean, but also last and projects. 
Highly recommended for everyday casual use. I find this a spring,summer nights and indoors and fall day fragrance only.
I too think this is more modern and smells better than Original Vetiver by creed What a beautiful fresh and sparkling fragrance for summer days, quite similar to original vetiver by Creed but I prefer this one. Good job Creed! Mugler Cologne is a fresh light cologne. The bergamot and neroli dissipate fairly quickly and what you're left with is a sweetish scent akin to freshly cut grass. Perfect for summer/spring days or after a shower.
If you really want it to shine, layer it with Ferrari's Bright Neroli. Amazing! This is one of fragrances I put out of my mind , but shouldnt have.I used to hear so many reviewers say it was soapy and nice, and I thought I didn't want that.
After smelling this it is a clean, citrusy aromatic with a little soapyness. It is fresh and clean, but does not smell like irish spring soap or any other odd impression I got in my head prior. 
Anyways, this is a lovely, casual, easy to wear second skin kind of scent that last quite well and isn't cologne concentration, like I thought. It last 5 to 7 hours and has fair projection and seems to come back in the heat too.
This may not be the party scent, or show stopper, but such a easy to wear , likable and clear replacement for molecule 01 ,in my opinion, deserves more love.
I used to love lucky you by LC as a clean, fresh second skin smell and this is much better and a soon to be purchase.
Happy sniffing ! I already left a review about this cologne but I cannot resist doing it again simply because it is my all time favorite everyday fragrance. in fact I cannot even imagine a man loving this cologne. It feels feminine to me. I am a person that always has gravitated towards masculine smells in selecting my fragrances but this one doesn't even smell masculine at all to my nose.
There is only one small problem and that is the mugler cologne does not last on my skin more than 45 minutes. I have read a bunch of suggestions about other cologne that smell like this but none of them have been unisex. I do not understand why there are not more women's perfumes that smell fresh soapy and clean like this. Why does it have to be a man to smell clean? This is far better than smelling like a flower in my opinion.
Lastly if you want to I have discovered that this can be layered with many other fragrances. One that works particularly well is a beautiful perfume that's really inexpensive simply called Fresh Life. You can get a bottle of it on eBay for $20. If you go on Sephora it'll cost you 50. It layers nicely and that one is also a very fresh smell as the title indicates. It just happens to last a little bit longer for me. Just an idea in case anyone is interested in trying it This smells like Ferrari Radiant Bergamot. RB is way sharper and brighter in the opening. This one is pretty tamed. IMO, just grab the F RB because it is cheaper and has way more lasting power. If your idea of a perfect fragrance is one that simply smells clean and fresh and wonderful—look no further than Mugler Cologne. It's hard to find fault here. From jeans and T-shirt to office attire; in any social or business function, Mugler Cologne will always be just right. This is light and fresh incarnate...very heavy on the petitgrain, which is a note I love...this doesn't last very long, like most ""colognes"" and is not overly citrusy like most...nice summer fragrance and a good price point and available in huge bottles, which you'll need due to longevity issues on this one...still a winner... I understand why this is on so many reviewers' top ten list. It does smell very clean, in a soapy not citrus way. It is very inoffensive and would be perfect for a hot summer day or any close quarter situation. Longevity on me is not great, but not bad either. Really love this! This perfume is not citrusy on me at all, it is very soapy. To me it smells somewhat similar to Crabtree and Evelyn's Jojoba soap which I adore. However after a few hours it does not smell fresh on me anymore, instead I smell a very musky, dirty note that lingers in the dry down. I guess the S-note in it is not for me. It is also not very long-lasting. I am a woman and I like a lot of different things but in the summer I like sharp citrus and fresh smelling types of colognes and perfumes. I'm kind of all over the place and what I wear every week. I still wear vintage poison at least once a week and the rest of the time it's fresh life or Tom Ford NP. 
I bought this because someone suggested that this smell like Tom Ford in P. While it does have some similar notes and overall smells clean and fresh just like Tom Ford it is not a dupe by any means. But after I tried it it smelled so good on me and so clean and fresh which is what I want living in the mountains of West Virginia and not getting out much it doesn't make sense for me to use up my Tom Ford when I could get the same effect essentially from this. So now I save the time forward for when I'm going out and every other day I wear this one. In fact I love this so much that I bought a second one already for a backup. 
I live in a small town in a mountain in West Virginia and there is literally no good shopping. So I have to really pre-plan everything that I'm going to buy and order it while it's online because there's not a chance I'm going to get to a store that selling it. 
Now that I have the fresh clean scent covered I'm going to go back to focusing on trying to find a Dupe for vintage poison. I was given some ideas and multiple people recommended a perfume called incanto. That one smells so far from vintage poison that I may as well have just gone ahead and bought the current version of poison. I know it's off subject but if anyone has any suggestions please let me know. I can't get past my love for poison. When I was 15 it came out and I was immediately addicted. Now I'm 48 and just as addicted if not more to that beautiful scent. Nothing like it. So finally I bought this one! the opening is very very similat to CREED O.Vetiver and I am happy because I have Creed O.V and Love it very much and I was looking for a cheap similar scent. fresh,soapy and nice. I really like the way this cologne smells, but only after the dry-down. The opening, to my nose, is extremely synthetic--it's cloying, and irritates my eyes. :/ I think there might be an aroma chemical in Mugler Cologne that I'm allergic to, and that's a shame. Does it smell like fancy body soap?...Meh. Does it smell like like Irish Spring soap?...Nope, not at all. Does it smell fresh and clean?...absolutely. I think the smell is more reminiscent of a laundry detergent than a body soap. Imagine the most luxurious detergent money could buy, and the synthetic, clean, floral, musk quality it would posses. That's what this smells like. Don't get it twisted, it doesn't smell like Tide or Gain, this is much more subtle smelling than either of those. However, MC (especially in the opening) has an undeniable synthetic-quality about it that links it to a laundry soap. When I'm wearing it, I get faint whiffs of Dolce & Gabanna's Light Blue. When the chemical concoction that this is settles and fades the wearer is left with a nice citrus-vetiver-musk. It's good. If the first 2 hours didn't irritate my senses, I'd rate it an 8/10 overall for what it is. If you just want to smell clean, I don't think you can beat Mugler Cologne. This is the plain white t-shirt of colognes. it's not going to ""wow"" anyone and it isn't meant to. it's soapy, it makes you smell as if you just took a shower. I got MUGLER COLOGNE hair conditioner which was provided in an expensive hotel. It smelled so unique and good that I had to check, what is this??? I absolutely love the scent. It's hard to describe. It's both very green and fresh, but also remarkably rich, and somehow even sensual. I was surprised to see neroli listed as top note here. I do not like neroli at all and I do not sense it in Mugler Cologne. The floral note here is more like lily of the valley to me. I desperately want this perfume, but haven't found it anywhere. This was my first exposure to neroli/orange blossom and I'm absolutely amazed. The inspiration behind this fragrance was apparently Moroccan soap - and indeed it smells like a very green bar of soap. This fragrance starts off with lots of bergamot and neroli, with neroli being the main note. If I could describe the scent it sort of smells like a green lime to my nose; and I'm a huge fan of it. The bergamot is very noticeable in the opening. As a person whose favourite scent in the world is the smell of limes (and who owns a bunch of lime colognes and aftershaves), this definitely counts as the bergamot here is a very green and potent variety that smells similar to limes. This fragrance is totally unisex and could be worn literally by anyone. On drydown it smells the same as the opening but with less citrus and more white florals. It is extremely pleasant. Sillage is moderate leaning and longevity is extremely good (if I use moisturizer beforehand), running at over 12 hours on my skin and projecting to my nose even without me having to sniff my arm. This is unbelievable for a fresh fragrance. Overall this is a masterpiece of a cologne that I adore quite a bit as it makes me feel fresh, clean, and ""limey"" with better longevity than a lime fragrance - in fact the liquid being green is very apt. This is my favourite fragrance of all time.
5/5 Brilliantly Fresh...clearly a unisex fragrance. Very citrusy,very fresh. Great longevity even in the peak of the Indian Summer. Easily lasts for 8-10 hrs. Projects very well for the initial 2-3 hours giving out a very fresh citrus and clean sillage. Definitely a compliment getter. Best used on hot summer days.Had to wash it off at night since the freshness was too bothersome to sleep.
Quality...8/10
Longevity...8/10
Sillage...7/10.
Must have if you are looking for a non-aquatic fresh summer fragrance. Love it This is a very surprising scent, in that the opening is very sour, almost like pickles! Must be neroli, because that note never agrees with my nose. But then it quickly blossoms into a very pleasant green scent. Aside from the notes listed above, I can smell vetiver, lemongrass and even cucumber. All in all it’s as green as can be. Quite unexpectedly is's 100% D&G Light Blue on me. Not a bad thing, I quite like it. I'm looking forward to summer, it will be my holidays hit :) This scent isn´t just fresh. It´s INCREDIBLY FRESH from beginning to end. This cologne is like a cold & refreshing shower after a long and hot summer day. And I love all its facets - green, herbal, sour & sweet - and they are surprisingly pleasantly natural /which is not typical for Mugler´s perfumes/. I can understand those perfume lovers who described it as a future classic - it deserves it. 100% Spring Irish Green Soap. It smells the same to original vetiver except MC is 2D while OV is a 3D fragrance. All creed's have this 3D scent bubble to them which you cannot buy at a lower price. Mugler at its price, is superior in my opinion to OV. To those saying this is close to OV your sniffers must be broken. OV is much deeper and way richer. This is the type of scent you wear on a hot humid summer day when you just wanna feel clean and fresh. Good but not great. Citrus blast for about an hour. This is an excellent warm and hot weather fragrance and suitable for most any situations: chillaxing, casual, office, gym, date, sexing, et cetera. Performance and longevity is impressive too. Keep in mind that this fragrance isn't groundbreaking by any means. It's just a simple fragrance that smells really good! 
Overall Score: 8.5/10 Love it Good luck finding a better-priced casual, inoffensive, daily fragrance. Projection and longevity are nothing to write home about indeed. But guess what? This is not intended to be a powerhouse that fills the room, nor a massive compliment-getter. It is exactly what it needs to be. A clean and fresh out of the shower scent. Green, soapy, citrusy. It's unlikely to garner compliments due to its soft nature, but trust me - people that get close to you WILL notice that you smell nice and clean, although they won't go out of their way to say it. Mugler perfumes, like his fashion, are always a bit odd. Like a traditional idea seen through the lens of a sci-fi flick type of futurism. Cologne is like this. It takes something like a traditional citrus splash and adds boldly synthetic notes to all three levels of the pyramid until it smells as technicolored and surreal as the chartreuse-colored liquid itself. It’s a very specific synthetic-aquatic scent that I have recognized on men passing by in Le Marais district of Paris. Not for everyone but worth a try for anyone looking for a powerhouse, long-lasting summertime citrus/aquatic. Awesome smell. It smells like an old-fashioned green bar of soap, my grandmother had lying in her bathroom. However, Mugler Cologne does not smell old-fashioned at all. It smells very simple and clean. Not really an out of the shower vibe, but a mix between freshly out of the shower and a walk through a field full of blooming young flowers on a warm Spring morning.
For me, this is an all-season fragrance. Why should a person not smell squeaky clean in Fall and Winter?
This is my go-to gym scent.
Scent: 9/10
Projection: 7/10
Sillage: 7/10
Longevity: 7/10 (For this price? Totally worth respraying)
Versatility 10/10
Uniqueness: 8/10
Price-performance: 12/10 (€60 for 300ml? That is insane!)
Total: 8.5 One of my favorites and go-tos. 
Definitely uni-sex. Can be worn by men and women without worries.
The simplicity of this cologne is what makes it so good. The soapy, fresh opening is what you get throughout the cologne. Which is exactly what a soapy fresh cologne should do. 
A very safe choice that can be worn to most occasions. Overall some of the best bang for the buck out there!
Scent: 8/10
Longetivity: 7/10
Sillage: 3/5 Any woman wearing this? It's so beautiful grassy, soapy (Savon de Marseille?) , clean, fresh, uplifting scent that I'm jelaous that I can't put it on me :/ I just blind bought this based on the reviews. It is what everyone else says it is, but on me, the lovely citrus smell that you get with the initial spray leaves very quickly, and all that is left is a sweet powdery soap close to the skin that isn't very appealing to me. I will likely keep it though and just refresh often when wearing this. Smells just like Creed O.V.The difference is the dry down. Mugler is a little more soapy Creed smells like clean vetiver. I use it to keep from spraying my Creed O.V. I tried this juice in Nordstrom in 2001. I almost bought it but went with another fragrance. I liked that it was fresh but yet had a light soapy sweetness to it. I'd love to get this.. Very much like hermes voyage. Citrus clean fresh. Decent office perfume fits for summer time. Like an elegant english cologne. Defines being unisex for a perfume. I just want to add. 
Originally this was an eau de cologne but was upgraded to an eau de toilet strength and they kept the original name of Mugler cologne.
It performs better than it did originally. This maybe why some people say it doesnt perform because maybe they had the original version. The new version is not beastly but it's not bad. It's what can be expected from this type of fragrance.
I fully recommend the latest batch anyway. Mine is great. It works for me and for £25 for 100ml.
Don't forget they do a 300ml bottle for about £56. I bought a bottle of this a few days after trying it. I was impressed by the first try in Debenhams. It was on my jacket as well, not on skin.
So I bought a bottle and didn't try it out for a few weeks other than a test spray on my hand.
I wore it yesterday morning and topped it up for the evening and reached for it again today.
It feels so fresh and clean. It does smell soapy and has little sweet floralness to it and it has a certain edge to it.
I find it's strength good and it lasts well enough considering the type of scent it is. It has a nice projection that's not overpowering. It's really safe to wear without having to worry about it. Can wear it with confidence knowing that you smell great and clean and fresh.
Price is also very good. 
Presentation is probably what drew me to this fragrance. The glass bottle is very nice with the silver metal screw on atomizer and it has a strong clear plastic cap that clips into place. The bottle and cap have the TM logo on. My bottle has a sticker on the side at the bottom and MUGLER on the box and not the previous signature box.
I could only find the batch code on the box so keep hold of it. There is no batch code on the bottle itself.
This is a solid purchase for me. Loving it even though it's December and out of season so I'm guessing it will be even better in the spring and summer months. My gfs number one favorite. I would consider it tied with around 5 others for my number 1 spot Only a dirty beast wouldn't like this. It's fresh, green, clean, simple, yet interesting. Yes, it's like Creed's rip-off and given a choice I'd have that. But they are different and this is joyous, and fantastic value. 
I'd love this to be a scent kids and teens go for, it's so fresh and innocent and would definitely stop them from sniffing glue and mugging pensioners. 
This and Happy are just fun, unsophisticated joy.
My teenage daughter often has a squirt of my cologne when she goes out and, happily, it's usually this. I tried this. It smells of soap and grass. Its very interesting actually. I think I like it. More for spring and summer.. Price is good too and it didn't smell weak at all. Opens up citrusy and quickly dries down into a very authentic soapy scent. I use this sometimes after shower and it suits that occasion well as it is also a refreshing fragrance.
Feeling: cleanliness. 
7/10 Clean, fresh scent.
Do not spray too much or you will smell like PINE-SOL. This is a Neroli based cologne, and so is similar to Tom Ford's Neroli Portofino. I much prefer this. It also reminds me of Jardin Sur le Nil by Hermes. With this you're getting soapy neroli, with a hint of muskiness, just like the description. Whereas I find TF Neroli Portofino too heavy, thick, and cloying, this is light, transparent and pleasing. Like Alberto Morillas' other creations this has a characteristic airy sibilance. 
I would worry, with TF Neroli Portofino, to wear it at work for fear of overpowering. If you over-spray this you will smell like expensive soap, which isn't too much of an issue. As colognes should, it fades in a non-linear way. It's still present and pleasant toward the end of the day but it isn't cloying. An excellent cologne great for morning use, daytime, work, summer days etc. 
The bottle design is also unexpectedly appealing in real life. It's has a pared-down geometric, modernist (but modern, 21st century) feel, with retro paper stickers and it comes supplied with two caps - one splash and one spray. Koonsian, hyper-real neroli cologne. Back in the day I was the biggest TM geek on the planet. I wore Angel to death and quite frankly, every TM frag that came out was just wonderful on my skin. I LOVE this house. 
In the 90's, TM Cologne was my handbag staple during those long summer months where a 'freshen up' during the day was necessary. 
Fast forward 20+ years and I have recently purchased a bottle of Cologne. I was hesitant because I though that the reform wouldn't be as delicious as the original. Indeed, Angel has changed beyond recognition now, being too heady and not as long lasting as the original. I was scared to revisit something that was so beautiful to me all those years ago. 
I needn't have worried because as soon as I spritzed I knew that very little had changed. This is a beautiful cologne, fresh, sweet and uplifting. Its gorgeous and totally great for layering. Today I was wearing Gucci Bloom and layered it with TM Cologne, WOW!!! this combo is simply stunning! I imagine that this will layer well with many green florals.
The cologne lasts for hours on my skin, as I said before, all TM frags seem to be made for my chemistry so I can only report on my own experiences. The projection is also lovely and the perfume seems to sweeten with time. (Hell, I am in love again)!
Is it worth all the hype? You better believe it! Soapy neroli cologne. Uplifting in the high heat.
Fits casual dressing or for in-house use.
Good longevity in skin and poor on clothes
Worth the hype? Totally no. Its just a simple cologne. It's a soapy fragrance and smells nice.
BUT it lasts only 15 minutes and disappears very quickly.
I don't see the point of a fragrance that is so short lived.
very, very weak.
(I got mine direct from Mugler) Light, fresh, soapy scent. Safe smell for the warmer weathers This is light,clean,crisp n fresh scent .... it's an all season fragrance but best suited for spring & summer .... longevity I get like 8hrs with moderate projection.... in my opinion it's best suited for gym ... It's a cologne and performs like a cologne. This is a lovely soapy fresh juice that is quality. Please don't expect the longevity of an EDT tested, very weak and don't deserve the hype
this should be a household cleaning spray, or bathroom freshener. Layer this with Molecule 01 or ISO E super and you will have a great fragrance. Smells nice for about 30mins.Have bought better summer cologne much cheaper and better quality from supermarkets in the Mediterranean!
Realise now sometimes it is the bottle ,which is lovely and the name which sells a fragrance such as this just a mild,ordinary citrus..
I feel it will be relegated to my bathroom shelf for guests to use freely or as an air freshener.
1 out of 10!! As others already wrote it's fresh and unisex. At beginning I got a lot of bergamont, but after time it's not that aggressive. A lot of sweet-ish and lightly spicy white floral soapiness with unique, perfumery quality twist to it. With time it becomes even more spicy and musky."
5,Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998," I'd been meaning to try this perfume for years, so I had really high hopes for it. I'd heard it described as approachably sexy and dirty, like light BDSM, so I expected something heady and complex, but grounded and easy to wear. I'd heard so many good things about Black that I bought a slightly larger than usual sample from Surrender to Chance thinking, ""of course I'll want to wear this all the time!"" Unfortunately, after taking it for a couple of spins, I'm not impressed. All I'm really picking up is rubber, vanilla, and nothing else. It doesn't really bloom on my skin, or go in any other direction, or surprise me at all. I might have gotten burned because I was expecting something more like The Zoo's marvelous Club Design. That scent is also largely centered around rubber, but it unfolded on my skin in this exciting, unpredictable way that kept me smelling my wrist throughout a period of at least 12 hours. It not only had that tire smell Black probably made famous, but the inside of the car as well-- a very nice car to boot, with a plush leather interior. Club Design took me through a nostalgic whirlwind of car trips and sex and beyond, while Black was just... there. Maybe I need to give Black another chance in a cooler season that suits it better, but Club Design might've spoiled me. I'd recommend that scent in a heartbeat to anyone else underwhelmed by this one. I respect this perfume for what it is. A perfume that looks like rubber tires and also smells like rubber tires? Brilliant!
To be honest though, I like the concept more than I like the perfume. Does it smell bad? No! 
Mind you this is my personal opinion, but I feel like there is lacking... something! I don't know what that something is. I also don't really know what occasion I would wear this. 
If you love perfumes and come across a bottle - buy it! How often do you come across a perfume that's interesting yet wearable anyway? 
Whatever! I love this fragrance but more as a piece of art than something I would wear. I will keep it! Why didn't I like this years ago ????
Just received my bottle today. And I am loving this.
IMO.....a combo of V&A Midnight in Paris/Aqualina Black Sugar/Zirh Icon and a touch of YSL Body Kouros thrown in.
I like the vanilla/leather/vinyl-ish vibes.
This is getting more and more expensive on line,so if you are a fan or want to get this....grab it before it sky-rockets $$$$
The performance is actually pretty decent on me. 
I may have to buy a back-up ! Very similar to Prada Luna Rossa Black, but different at the same time. I like the Prada more, but it doesn't last as long on me as Blvgari Black does.
Blvgari Black has a vanilla rubber smell and the Prada instead has a amber powdery smell in its place.
I do think if you like Blvgari Black then you would also enjoy the Prada. I feel the Prada is a safer blind buy though. Purchased this in prob 06 during a depressing dark time of my life, so today when I think of it sorrow comes to mind. I have over 100 colognes, I started collecting the past 2 years and It's gotten a bit out of control. I bought some encre noir lately and am shocked how much it smells like black, well at least the black of 15 years ago. In my opinion it has the peppery openings that are the same and even the dry down is the same as what I remember black being.. I'm sure blacks sent his changed over the year and I haven't smelled it since but this is definitely how it used to smell. Ok, so my love story with this gem began last year when a friend of mine told me that she wanted to give away an almost full bottle because it reminded her of someone she didn't want to be reminded of. Back then I wasn't fully aware of the 'cult' status of this fragrance and didn't know what to expect. When I first sprayed it on my wrist, I was surprised by a note (or combination rather) that I wasn't quite sure I liked. Perhaps that was the notorious rubber/tyre note that is off-putting to many. I accepted it just for the sake of enriching my collection. However, as time went by, I began to appreciate it and the 'like' gradually grew to become 'love'. I don't mind the rubber note anymore because I relish the leather and vanilla fusion that follows (the most prominent notes I can smell) - classy, extravagant and rebellious at the same time. A truly unique scent, such a shame it got discontinued... Soft smoky leather. Almost suet like. I don’t get much tea. I wish I did, because I love tea. One of the best and easiest to wear leather. But still try it before you buy it.
7/10 Black Bvugari: This product has the neatest packaging. The box has not just a flap but a thick hatch. The bottle sits sideways peering out a window. The bottle is just like a tire. The top is the center hub, and the shoulders of the bottle are trimmed in real--yes real!!-- rubber. Imagine a tire. The tire is labeled BVLGARI. Sitting on a surface it is super low profile and looks like a tire. Wonderful to hold with a thick steel atomizer cap. Metal and rubber. 
Just for neat guy stuff this gets an ' A' for originality. 
The scent is really original, but not a projection or sillage standout. First off, my skin is absolutely an absorption monster. I sprayed two times on the flat of my arm, both right and left. Maybe 'Gone In Sixty Seconds' ties in with the car thing, but it was a skin scent in about sixty seconds!!!!
What a wonderful, all original fleeting moment. It has a major waft of tire shop which I love. I smell a nice vanilla, not boozy. I think I smell jasmine. I detect a slight orange--the bergamot. So of the eleven notes on the list, I detect only about four. I think the tire smell is from the Leather. This is one of the most original scents, I cannot stop spraying and sniffing.
A real opinion. This EDP offers an interaction of the notes unlike any I have sensed. I believe this is part of the magic of synthetic notes and molecules that are man-made. This unique interaction can only happen with synthetics in my opinion. This is why I think synthetics are really exciting, and just starting to take hold. 
Certainly there are endless interactions on the natural note front. Many scents have fifteen or more notes so top parfumers can do anything and go beyond any limit.
As we move into synthetics we will see more accords/notes that are not derived from natural scents. We will see notes that are completely detached from any botanical, animalic or other form. BVLGARI BLACK hints at petroleum products in the form of a rubbery scent. 
Do we name it 'Tireshop Vanille'? 
I love the box. I love the packaging. I do not need ridiculous duration. My personal taste in scents is that I like 'em to come and then I like 'em to go. Still, I have scents with the deliberate strategy of projection. 
Aside: This review is written from my own perspective with bias and attitudes and my own collector philosophy.
Look. . . I do like the crass and artificial scents of the '70s and '80s. I don't mind scents that smell cheap because cheap can be fun--for me at least. There is a cheap side to me. For example, Lolita Lempicka Au Masculine with licorice or Anise. How fun!! Maybe even. . . Put on that cherry scent. How fun!!!! Juicy Couture Dirty English with a base of Escentric Molecule 05. Fun, cheap, naughty.
Also, I like to rotate scents so I don't need a scent that you have to call the HazMat team to get it out of your frickin' Pendleton wool shirt. Looking at the notes on Fragrantica, I never would have bought this but I smelled a sample years ago and loved it. This was my foray into unisex scents. There was nowhere like Fragrantica to go and check reviews at the time and had I known about the rubber and road accord, I probably would have said no. I'm glad I got it because the drydown is wonderful on my skin, a perfectly non-sweet vanilla leather. I would say it leans on the masculine side of unisex and I think the write-up from the company under the description is correct - this is black tea, not green. Longevity and sillage are moderate on me and I wear it in cooler weather, too smoky for summer. One of my very first adult fragrance buys back then and still glad I bought it. There's definitely been reformulation. My current bottle purchased from a grey market site is but a sheer memory of its former glory, veering straight for the vanilla drydown it used to take hours to reach. But it's a vaguely badass comfort scent & as close to a gourmand as this sugar avoider is likely to own. Under $30 is irresistibly affordable by perfume standards. Seems silly not to add it to the collection. Just commit to the overspray. This is the brother to Versace Crystal Noir. Bvlgari Black came first. It smells less synthetic and shampoo perfumey than Crystal Noir.
Bvlgari Black has black tea, cedar and leather notes but, they are beautifully blended in. Not the Shalimar level of leather. 
I also, smell laconic notes and coconut? in Bvlgari Black. I know it's not what other people are posting in comments, but it's what it smells like to me. The grounded cedar in here, rather than the perfumey floral base of Versace Crystal Noir makes Bvlgari Black more wearable to me. A real bargain price for this perfume. 
Both perfumes are made in Italy. 
I remember smelling this perfume in 2014. Its been reformulated. Then, the tire note was distinct and stood out. Now it's creamy and refined. Definitely worth trying.
It's not a sweet or gourmand perfume.
I really like this perfume and bought a back-up. Someone else here has said it's discontinued and I can't see it on Bvlgari's website. This is one of my all time favorites. For me it smells like success, wealth, royalty. got Bvlgari Black about a month ago. blind buy as well.
this is some juice and a half! but one thing that's bugging me is the opening, it reminds me of a fragrance I use to have but I can't think what. 
I really don't want to say it but Davidoff champion keeps popping up in my head. 
I had Davidoff champion many... moons ago. 
and I can't believe Ive ordered a little 30ml just to see if it is that. 
but yeah bvlgari black gets a 10/10 from me. 
and that rubber note is addictive. I don't usually write negative reviews, but the burned black rubber note in this is just a terrible one for me personally.
It was very popular so a lot of people must love it, but just be advised it's definitely not a safe blind buy. I do not get the overwhelming burned rubber smell others seem to be having, I find it to be a nice mild scent. It is quite powdery, and not overly strong. I would consider it a unisex scent as it is not overpoweringly masculine or feminine. One of my favourites so far. Batch code: 11I14CE1 (2018-11)
I might have bought the last bottle in stock? 
Bought it a week before Christmas and now I can't find it anywhere. 
Just like the reviewer below me says, it's a unique fragrance in a unique bottle. 
I want to add to the record that this fragrance smell a lot of tonka bean in the opening, which makes sence when it's firmly compared to Midnight In Paris.
In the drydown I get musk, amber, green tea and sandalwood.
Warm but distinct. 
There might be some vanilla in the drydown. But I don't get any leather to speak about.
The drydown is definitely unisex. 
I give this scent an overall 8/10
Uniqueness 9/10
Longevity 7.5/10
Sillage 6.5/10 So I don't have this anymore, just an empty bottle. I do love the bottle for this fragrance, it's unique, just like the fragrance itself. I know people have mentioned the rubber smell, well I love that rubber smell, it satisfies my sniffer. It's like a big tire swing hanging from tall mountain trees. The rubber smell quickly morphs into a soft woods with just the right amount of floral and a touch of vanilla. This is one of my old favorites. It's a lovely fragrance for any gender. My old favorite.
It doesn’t matter that once an estimated eight-year-old girl told me that I smell like poop. Believe me, it was Bvlgari Black, not me or my ass.
On the other hand, a close acquaintance of mine told me that the scent is just like a cheap Russian woman.
I have not received any other comments.
Otherwise, if you only knew how spiteful comments I have received for another Menardo masterpiece, Patchouli 24.
For me, Black is one of the best perfumes of all time. Those who hate it can break up into pieces for me.
A delicate powder made of jasmine, rubber, coumarin and vanilla, all massaged together, into a unpretentious perfume suitable for all beautiful souls. I don't get it🤷🏻♂️, I don't know why you guys love it so much, but I can't remember the last time I wanted to smell like a freaking tire, ah wait I do remember, NEVER!
I'm definitely selling my bottle It’s nice, don’t expect to fill a room in beast mode or have it last any more than a few hours. I cannot for the life of me get any sort of rubber note but I cant fault the balance of notes. Some people are head over heels in love with this perfume - but if they ever get a chance to own Midnight In Paris especially in EDP form it’ll blow them away - it’s almost like (and I don’t like to say it) Black Bulgari is a clone of MIP with everything turned down and quite frankly poor performance. I own both so can compare side by side. Its worth buying a bottle now as prices will no doubt skyrocket as it’s discontinued It's like someone went to a black tie event, stole one of the cars from the valet and did a burnout in the middle of a sugar plantation. How can a fragrance be so formal yet so badass?
Whatever bottle I purchased has the strength of an eau de cologne, but I LOVE this fragrance. I don't care if I have to unload 10 sprays onto my clothing to get weak projection, moderate performance and have to buy a new bottle every month ($45AUD 75ml). Totally worth it in my opinion. From what I can gather this has been discontinued and I am probably holding onto the last whispers of a reformulation. If you've experienced it previously it's probably safe to assume that this is a shadow of its former self, but as a newbie I am deeply in love.
If anyone knows of any other fragrance that has this burnt-tire note with a sweet boozy vanilla backing (but with better performance) please let me know! For a house that does relatively safe fragrances, this one pushes out the boat. There is undoubtedly a burnt rubber note on the initial spray. A little like the smell you may remember from slamming on your brakes a little too hard. But that dissipates pretty quickly to become a warm smoky vanilla, leather, and woody scent. Really challenging at first, but not in a bad way, to become a really versatile cooler weather fragrance. Really good and not sure why I didn’t purchase it years ago. Blind buy? If you like vanilla, leather, and woods, absolutely. 
8/10 I’m trying a 2004 batch right now and I gotta say I really like it. It’s like a leathery (or rubbery) vanilla that I think would smell good on anyone. It’s got that uniqueness factor which sets it apart from other designer scents but also has enough familiarity as well. It’s not a heavy scent either imo. I wonder how the newest formulation compares. Not quite my cup of tea.. If you're looking for a similar scent: try Atkinson's Pirates Grand Reserve, which is a bit more smokey. Afternoon tea in an S&M chamber: that is what Bvlgari Black brings to mind. Most people glom onto the initial rubber note, and I understand why--it's a fascinating way to kick things off. The drydown brings in the more conventional accords of green tea, musk, vanilla, and some vaguely woody notes. I was expecting something a bit more aggressive and enigmatic, but this is still a very unique scent. I wouldn't even say that it smells ""good"" on my skin, but elicits more of a ""ooh, what is that?"" reaction in me. I wish there was a parfum version of this because I'd be all over that. As others have mentioned, the sillage is on the weaker side but it does stick to the skin for a good few hours. After trying this one out, I couldn't stop picturing the advertising agency pitch meetings: ""C'mon, what woman doesn't want her man to smell like old band-aids?!"" I've finally got my nose on this after all these years. Truth be told, I've been looking for something that is similar to Midnight in Paris and for years people have compared it to Bvlgari Black.
You can certainly see where Van Cleef & Arpels got their inspiration from, huh? Upon first spray, this immediately reminded me of MiP. MiP even has that rubbery note, though nowhere near as pronounced as the one found in Black. 
I love the intense rubber in the opening, it really sets this apart. A beautiful tea note encased in vanilla. This is good stuff. Burned rubber note? Yes please! It's why I loved Dzing! back in the day.
I don't know if I had smelled Bvlgari Black before. I have a decant - and it smelled so familiar, right away. I never owned this, but I knew it instantly. 
And ye Gods, I adore it. Smoky, deep, flawless, complex, soft but dark... it makes my heart beat faster. It's so gorgeous, it hurts.
I'm getting mixed stories on whether this was discontinued or reformulated. I sure as heck hope not. A full blown masterpiece. Perfect blend of smoky semi-fresh rubber / tea /vanilla notes along with leather and woods. Urban & sexy. NYC minus the trash / garbage bag smell. Dark, alluring, energetic, special. Like the shadow of Batman. a piece of art! I loved smellysmello's description of this as an 'accessible weirdo'. Hits the nail right on the head. hannahwdraws said it pretty well in her review as well; it's weird and edgy, yes, but it doesn't scream. It's quiet and rather content in its weird little corner, just doing its thing. It doesn't hit you over the head with its weirdness, it's subtle and understated. 
I think pretty much everything that can be said about this has already been said. It opens very rubbery indeed which quickly dries down to a soft vanilla leather. I find it quite jarring in that its leather note is so very reminiscent of rubber and yes, I do get the car tyre smell from it too, but I'm unsure of whether this is an objective observation or a subjective one as I had read reviews describing it as such before smelling it. I suppose I'll never know. 
I could see this working very well for edgy youngsters, the kind who listen to grunge and punk rock but who don't feel the need to remind the world of this every chance they get by wearing mohawks or excessive studs or something like that. This is for the more subtle among them, the kind who just go their own way, no matter what anyone else thinks. This is a truly individualistic scent. 
Sillage is polite but definitely there, longevity could probably be better. It's one of a kind, androgynous and hard to pin down. Surprisingly - though a scent I'd describe as 'warm' rather than 'cold' - this works quite well in summer. 
I'm not sure yet if I can become friends with this, if I'm willing to take the risk of others perceiving me as smelling like a car tyre. I'm not sure if I'm cool enough for Black. But it's definitely a 90's gem, a true embodiment of that decade's Zeitgeist and perfume culture. A must try.
Tiny edit after prolonged wearing: this is perfect for layering scents. Just a bit of this on top of any scent you like but feel misses a bit of edge, will make it perfect. On its own as well, this is an absolute compliment magnet. Have had numerous people ask me what I'm wearing whenever I've worn Black on its own or layered with Trussardi My Name. The vanilla seems similar to the vanilla in D & G Feminine - it's growing on me! As stated in previous reviews, Bvlgari's Black has a leather / rubber vibe similar to Bentley's Absolute for Men, and Chopard's 1927 Vintage. This is an absolutely fantastic fragrance and so glad I added to my collection. The leather, vanilla, amber and other notes are blended well. It has decent projection and longevity, although I think Bentley's Absolute may beat this one in terms of performance overall. This has a bit of powder but not overbearing, and this has a dry sweetness, not sickly, gooey, candy sweet by any means. If you like leather and vanilla you'll love this fragrance too! 10 / 10 for me! My absolute favorite scent just overall not just as a perfume. I would use this as a body wash, room spray, detergent, anything. I say that also because the longevity on this perfume is noooooot good at all. It's down to pleasant powdery vanilla in a few hours. Its a nice enough vanilla but god... that opening hour of fresh leather and rubber is heavenly and makes me want to go back for more. 
It is so lovely because yes it is dark and edgy but it doesn't sacrifice comfort for bravado. It is still warm and luxurious like it doesn't need to put up an aggressive front to prove how cool it is: it knows how cool it is and has relaxed into it. 
A lovely bottle reminiscent of a tire and a good representation of the smell. It might look hard and masculine but is softer to the touch and more feminine than you may think. One of my first perfume loves so I'll add to the many reviews. 
Bvlgari Black is an accessible weirdo of a perfume. Although it has (to my mind) a masculine burnt rubber opening, I find the drydown of vanilla, tea and bergamont to be harmonious and genderless. 
It's hard to believe this was created as a department store mass-market fragrance - it has a quirky, niche sensibility. It's unexpected yet still easy to wear. There's a nice balance of badass and humor with this one. 
I hear it's been discontinued, which is a real shame. I see it regularly on the grey market for under $40. If you are one of the few who hasn't yet tried it, get this 90s masterpiece while you can. You won't regret it. Love the initial rubber smell - then the vanilla takes center stage for me and is a bit too innocent smelling. This is like a calmer Dzing! From my point of view, it is one of the most beautiful unisex perfumes. Although many consider it to be more masculine due to the aroma of ""burnt rubber"" in the opening, I feel it as pleasant, sexy and a woman.
I think it is the first designer perfume that dared to step on the territory of niche perfumes. Especially in the 1998s when the vast majority of houses launched fresh perfumes or in general ""safes"".
The unique smell of leather, vanilla, tea and that rubber accord ... wow ... a scent craze.
Too bad the projection was poor, otherwise it was on the podium. Just received it and on the initial spray it smells pretty good. 
Longevity is not great, it quickly dries down and after 2-3 it can barely smell it, what a shame. 
I’ve also tried Prada Luna Rossa Black and they smell identical but since Prada Luna Rossa Black is a EDP it lasts longer on me and Prada Luna Rossa feels more refined as well.
But 75ml for $40 then I think it’s okay Finnaly ordered it from Notino,because I know when it’s gone,it’s gone,and I don’t want to miss that,as i’m specially connected with that late 90’ era perfumes,but this one,I haven’t owned ever.It was on my hit list a long time,but until now,i haven’t pull the trigger.This was a blind buy,waiting to arrive,but I’m familiar with MiP,so I know I won’t be dissaspointed.Love the smell. It is still possible to find this online, but I only see in last few shops and the prices are going up steadily.
I personally don't love it but it's a classic and the bottle is freaking cool. So if you want to ever get it, I think the time might be now, this will be gone before next winter. A versatile spicy, non offensive but very tasteful all rounder that'll last though the day.
Mellow. Finesse gold that's doesn't fall into opulence. Can get a bit cloying though. 8/10 Bought this after Prada luna rossa black and they are very identical to each other. To my nose, Bvlgari black performs better and lasts longer. Planning to layer them together. Nice smell and unique. Very subtle but noticeable. My mom recently bought this for my birthday. Upon the initial spray, I recognized the familiarity as my mom used to wear this in my teen years. For this reason, I'll forever associate this fragrance with her.
It's a beautiful soft rubbery vanilla with leather, with a nice shot of bergamot in the opening. This is very inoffensive, yet has character. I wish it were stronger on the sillage, other than that, this is a gem of a fragrance. This is my first run with Bvlgari Black, with a single spray to the back of each hand this morning. My 5ml sample has been settling since arriving in the mail 3 days ago. 
Straight off there's a shot of bergamot, unfolding into a lightly sweet and spicy scent. I get no rubber or smoke, which I'm more than okay with, but there is an edginess to this fragrance that I'm loving. This is definitely a unisex fragrance, a type of fragrance to which I'm still fairly unaccustomed, however this a great initiation and a very nice offering. 
Looking at the note pyramid above, I'd say that I'm mostly picking up on the vanilla, sandalwood, musk and just a hint of rose. It's quite strong too (1hr). 
After 5 hrs I can't say that I've noticed much change since the initial application except to say it's now softer, with perhaps a stronger vanilla and less of the earlier spiciness. So far I've not picked up any leather either, but with several more wears it may reveal more of itself. Upon a 2nd application this afternoon to my chest and cleavage, the citrus is more obvious to my nose this time. I have to say that Bvlgari Black is simply a gorgeous fragrance and one that perhaps responds well with a little more heat. 
This is a really sexy, modern, niche-type scent. And absolutely FB worthy for me.
EDIT: picked up a new 75ml bottle for a very reasonable price and couldn't be happier. I love this one! بعضی از بهترین عطرهای تاریخ روی یه توازن ریسکی بین این دو عنصر متضاد بنا شدن: آکورد وتیوری ـ وانیلیِ هابانیتا و آکورد کهربایی ـ مرکباتیِ شالیمار. که این، قابلیت های احساسی اون عطرها رو گسترش میده و، زمانیکه کار، درست انجام شده باشه، به عطر اجازه میده که از هر لحظه به لحظه ی دیگه و از هر مود به مود دیگه بویی متفاوت نشون بده، انگار که همیشه چیزی جدید و شایسته واسه گفتن داشته باشه. بعبارت دیگه اون ها بویی نه صرفا زیبا، بلکه جذاب دارن.
یکی از دوستانم می گفت که یه نوع خاص از برنج دانه کوتاه کارنارولی که واسه درست کردن ریزوتو استفاده می کرده بنظر میرسیده که قصد اون رو میفهمیده و از یه هوش فطری برخوردار بوده اون برنج. حالا می تونم این بینش رو به عطر تعمیم بدم: بلک بطور نامشخصی با مغز حرف میزنه، اون توسط یکی از بزرگترین استعداد های این حرفه ساخته شده، آنیک مناردو از فیرمنیش. اون جفت-آکوردها تمام شده بودن، کاری که خانم مناردو انجام داد این بود که با همونا ابعاد جدیدی خلق کرد. بلک به طوری جسورانه روی سه محور در فضا کارش رو شروع می کنه: یک نت کهربای بزرگ، خشک و شیرین؛ یک نت فلورال بی صدای دهه پنجاهی از جنس عطر ژو غووین (بنزیل سالیسیلات) که به سبزی یه چراغ مطالعه بنکر هست؛ و سرانجام یه آکورد لاستیکی تلخ ـ پودری و فرِش که حس حضور تو یه فروشگاه یا تعمیرگاه دوچرخه رو میده. وقتی بلک رو برای اولین بار استفاده می کنید این سه نوا به شکل بی نقصی به شما اصابت می کنن (به شامه‌تون می‌رسن). چیز قابل توجه در مورد ساختار بلک اینه که فاقد تاپ نت یا درای‌داونه. مناردو سعی کرده یه هارمونی مستقل از زمان خلق کنه، در عین حالی که نسبت به تغییرات کوچیک تو احساسات شخص خیلی حساس هست. در زمان های مختلف استفاده، بلک به طرق مختلفی خودشو به شما نشون میده، همچون یه سرود نبرد آمازون، یه قاب زمرد سبز مجلل برای عکس ناپلئون در سالن اپرا، یا فقط یه لبخند ساده. بلک همچنین یه رنگ و بوی عالی از عطریات قدیم داره، درحالیکه کاملا جدید و مدرنه. بعضی کارها سعی میکنن کلاسیک باشن؛ درحالیکه یه سریا به سادگی هستن. یک عصر رو با بلک بگذرونید و شما پی میبرید که جایگاه اون درکنار بندیت، تابا بلون، و کابوشا، بین همه عطرهای بزرگ تاریخ که از هر قید و بندی آزادن هست. I love this fragrance. The problem is I can barely smell it after about 20 minutes. It seems to last a long time in the dry down, which is quite soft, mostly sweet. But I love that smoky, rubber scent with the first spray. So, I usually end up spraying myself a lot and frequently on those days I wear it. Today I tried spraying the sweater I am wearing; and behold! That initial opening scent remains on my clothing hours later. I guess this is the solution - to have all of it from the beginning to the dry down at the same time. Someone has said it is discontinued.....I hope that’s not true. This is a cold, medicinal leather. I don't get any vanilla. The lime and leather is a stark and striking combination. It's got something.
It's like the scent of a woman sitting at a wooden bar on a barstool, with dimmed, warm lighting, leather clutch in hand, legs crossed, black heels.. that is what this scent is to me. Dusky City (Annick Menardo, 1998)
Bottle Design: Thierry de Baschmakoff
Scentrack: Khruangbin – Mr. White
Composed by Annick Menardo and released in 1998, Bvlgari Black was a trailblazer in the fragrance world. I do not know the actual reactions in 1998, but it seems to me Black grew into one of the cornerstones of modern perfumery. A true legend. At this moment it is sad to hear the growing rumors that Black is being discontinued, but it is more than possible that another of our fragrance heroes is going to be euthanized.
Why do I appreciate Black so highly? First of all, it smells niche before the niche. It was very brave of Bvlgari to release something so novel in 1998. Black is an urban unisex fragrance that reminds me of a sunset in a city. Dusky, melancholic, but somehow still realistic. It opens with just a hint of citrus, and immediately goes to the beautiful rubber eraser accord that reminds of my school days. This rubber accord is additionally deepened by a comforting vanilla-amber-Tonka combo with a hint of leather. Juxtaposed to rubber and vanilla is a sparkling (almost peppery) green tea accord that gives the whole other dimension to the composition. Strange how these completely different tunes are coherent in this composition. Later this similar theme was replayed in Body Kouros (YSL, Annick Menardo), Midnight in Paris (VC&A, Olivier Polge), Luna Rossa Black (Prada, Daniela Andrier).
The composition seems simple and linear, but still possesses several somber layers. Black is perfect to wear with a leather jacket, while strolling in a city. The performance is mediocre, while I remember it back in a day as a more potent fragrance. Still, hoping that Bvlgari will not discontinue this dark urban gem for the sake of generations to come
Rating: 
9/10 (vintage version 10/10) I'm more of a vanilla hater but OMG how much I loved this perfume, the rubbery vanilla is really something, so odd and super edgy. It opens with a strong scent of burnt tires which then mellows as the vanilla picks up, and dries down to a vanilla-tea mix. The projection is soft, but it lasts quite a while (so far, about 5 h), though out in the cold it completely shuts down, so I guess it works better during the autumn or spring. Will definitely go to my to-buy list, especially now that it has been discontinued.
March 2020 update: I bought the bottle during the winter but was waiting for spring to see how it worked in a warmer weather. The rubbery aspect is much more emphasized, softly projecting after a couple of hrs. I sprayed it on my partner too, and he's liking it (which is quite unusual, since he doesn't like to wear perfume). I'm super happy to have bought this before the prices went crazy. Do so too, if you're into edgy scents.
8/10 Can glamour smell of charred exhaustion pipe cylinders and burnt tires spinning endlessly over asphalt? Well, after 5 minutes of coughing up scrap tire smoke off of my lungs, Bulgari Black told me that YES, it does. It starts with the turbo whistle of a dry, carbonized vanilla darkened by the jazz club-to campfire smoke of lapsang souchong and a lot of asphaltic sweetness from violet leaf, dressed in that modern urban uniform, the black leather jacket, one that has been dragged through the pavement and accessorized with cigarette burn holes. A breakbeat of latex and babypowder similar to the one in Habanita softens the testosterone of the leather though remaining androginous-to-masculine in the fragrances-girlfriends-steal-from-boyfriends category, and a disturbing erotic character, sexual, suggestively. 
It smells like an epistle from the urban youth of the XX century fin-de-siècle: EDM, inner-city raves, Y2K, the aggressive search for individualism, Fight Club, the surge of the worldwideweb, surviving the howling mob of metropolis and other concerns-du-jour of the time that in part trespassed barriers of millennia and remain to this day. There's a very individualistic not-playing-by-your-rules, dark and unrewarded by society Byronic hero theme scripting this. And Bvlgari Black was unrewarded at the end by being discontinued, and what a shame it was because this fragrance symbolizes what designer fragrances should ideally be about: a democratized, accessible avant-gardism that caresses on the cutting-edge without going full-tilt on it like niche. A very sensual smell of tyres, vanilla and tea. It dries out powdery and I find it very sexy for men and women as well! It is anusual and that's what makes it so attractively special... Layers of powdery leather roll over soft musks and green tea notes, balanced by a supple sweet vanilla bean. This fragrance is luxuriously dark and intriguing. The balance if amber and jasmin hide inside the heart and keep the fragrance slightly sharp and fruitful.
Sillage: Close
Performance: 5 hours A pleasant surprise! Yes, resembles Prada Luna Rossa Black a bit (similar fragrance for sure) but IMO better blend and more rounded up. I really like the soft projection and super longevity combination. Very well balanced and smooth blend of vanilla, green tea, leather and amber (with a pinch of wood and florals). Since it's discontinued, discounters have it for ~ $30. Get it! It's a gem. This is one of very few designer scents in y collection and I am very happy with it!!! This is a very pleasant sweet vanilla based scent on me. I've worn Prada Luna Rossa Black before and can see the similarities. And like Luna Rossa Black there is not a lot of development in my wearing of this fragrance. What I spray on is what I get for the rest of the wearing.
I'm very pleased I got my hands on this. I do wish that it developed more on my skin than I've experienced. 
I'm going to give it a shot in different times of the year to see if it wears differently.
EDIT: I think my disappointment with this perfume is that I get none of the interesting notes that are listed and people talk about. To me there's no tea, no leather, no rubber, just a flat vanilla and not a very interesting vanilla at that. I'm going to stick with Shalimar or Jicky or Chopard Casmir for a better vanilla fix. I think the writer to the description here on fragrantica is pretty spot on! Black definitely evokes the feeling of car tires, rubber, leather and wet asphalt. But at the same time it has this sweet vanilla side to it, which balances the rawness.
Very well created unisex scent, which is actually very sexy. I would find it very attractive on a woman, and as a man I also feel sexy, when i wear it myself. I bought after a long time and I had to return the perfume. smells completely different than before....too sweet. Bvlgari Black is a lovely unisex gem. It reminds me of BPAL Dorian (a very smooth, sweet, bright, predominantly vanilla and tea scent) plus bone-dry but buttery-soft suede. Both cozy and polished. If you like rubbery note, you should check dunhill century. rubbery accord presents from fresh in opening and screams really smoky like burn rubber in drydown. with solid sillage, projection and longevity. Thanks me later !!! The discontinuation of this little gem made me bought a bottle. I remember having smelled this one back when I started my journey in 2015 and liking it. At the time i bought the also discontinued Midnight in Paris and though that this would had been a redundant purchase.
4 years later, I purchased it just to see if this is really that similar or not and because it could had been the last opportunity before prices go crazy. I'm a huge Annick Ménardo fan and this fragrance is really one of their best creations, imo.
This is a very linear fragrance to start off. It starts off with the rubber accord that combines tea leafs, bergamot and a leather accord.
After an hour, this accord starts to mellow out and the vanilla became the king here. It has the MiP vibe but, imo, much better made. Instead of the tonka this one has vanilla and is more creamy and less aromatic than MiP which has an excellent note of Rosemary, by the way. Although this is more linear.
All in all, this is an excellent scent and I'm glad that I have a bottle. Super unisex and pleasant scent.
Longevity is pretty good. I get 10 plus hours on my skin, but the projection is very moderate in the first 2hours and close to the skin in the rest of the lifetime.
I give this one a 4/5 stars. Imagine yourself in a cold, frosty night in a middle of an oldtown of a climatic city. You are freezing to the bone so you need to warm up yourself. You step into the local café and order a cup of hot, sweet, essential tea. It's so cold you don't pull your leather gloves you're wearing on your hands. Accidentally few drops of tea fall on your gloves. That's basically the aroma of Black, yes it has an addition of vanilla but sometimes sweet black tea smells vanillic to me.
Longevity is around 6 hours, sillage is medium.
A very unique fragrance. I used to own and wear Midnight in Paris but it's more on the tonka side to me. And the ""rubber note"" is different.
I prefer Black. Obviously reformulated and a completely castrated scent that is a shade of the past. Where is this lovely accord of rubber ? Almost gone a and what´s left is so weak...shame on you, Bvlgari! After a small decant sample, I fell in love with this odd, but lovely scent. I really understand the references to rubber, though it is definitely more complex and nuanced that that. Leathery for sure, but a bit creamy, too. A shade of smoky vanilla, not cloying, thank goodness. Some amber and tea, with the rubber left at the base, which is great. Not an oh-so-popular fruity floral or heavy gourmand. Just sexy, for men or women. This perfume was born the same year I was born. I own a bottle dated 2001 and I waited so long before I spoke about this masterpiece. If Eric Draven wore a perfume, that could be Bvlgari Black and since I love ""The crow"", let's analyze Eric Draven's character:
Dark but Sweet;
Apparently he is a devil but inside he is an angel;
This perfume is exactly like this. Considering the fact that BB was born to represent the dark atmosphere of the big cities (think NY, TOKYO, LA ...) I would say that Annick Menardo succeeds great but it's not over here: I did a research and guess what .. .It's one of ANGELINA JOLIE's favorite perfumes!And it was not to be expected from a girl with her character.
The fragrance is magnetic, intriguing with green tea and leather in a vanilla frame. The amber is also very good, and despite its non-cloying sweetness the soul of this perfume is sad, melancholy, like an urban Encre Noire. One of my favorite fragrances.
10/10 A very clean leather/rubber/vinyl smell that isn't overly plasticky/chemical/latex. If you like the idea of any of these notes in fragrance but find most of the perfumes containing them to be too strong, you will probably like this. On one side I have given myself into this unique scent and on the other I really don't know what to feel about it :-)
I like it and I don't like it :-)
It is a special scent that has to be worn by the right person and what type of person is it...? While i actually like the smell of this and can definitely appreciate the creativity, it's hard for me to find a situation in which i would ever use it. Maybe if a had on a leather jacket and riding a motorcycle... ah, who am i kidding. I never do that and wouldn't wear cologne in that situation anyway. Cool scent though. I have a feeling that if Bvlgari Black projected anymore, it'd have not have gotten the love it does now. The rubberiness would've ended up far too intense.
As it stands, the rubber is nothing to be worried about. On the whole, this is a gorgeous, cozy smell with hints of various isolated accords which do their own thing - the sheer sweetness of vanilla, wafts of jasmine, sparks of rubberiness and some tea popping up once in a while.
Longevity wise, you get whiffs for about 6 hours, projection stays around an arms length for 1-2 hours. I use it as a nighttime scent at home and it always has a lovely, calming effect. Everything has been said already.
So I'll just confirm that it's a unique very well done accord that gives indeed an idea of rubber. Great creativity, good longevity (as a skin scent) but poor projection. Despite that, it's still worth it given the current very low price tag online. Would have expected ELdO to release such a frag more than Bvlgari!
Unisex, mildly cold evenings 25+ Unlit tobacco, smooth black tyre rubber ball, black tea, honey, warm vanilla... Toss them all in a bowl with the warmth of your hands, and get introduced to Bvlgari Black. It smells soooo different and nice... I love it. Well, what is there to say that hasn't already been said. One of the most unique and brilliant fragrances one can buy (for pennies, it has to be said). I've always believed that Turin and Sanchez tend to favour fragrances that change and evolve from their top notes to their drydown and this one changes inexorably. From that wonderful rubber opening to the most delicate floral, this is an utter masterpiece. The most surprising, unique and beautiful creation. When friends question why you are obsessed with fragrance then just get them to smell this. There are already tons of reviews on this page, but I'll add mine anyway. Bulgari Black reminds me of opening a new action figure toy as a child. Just like opening the plastic cover and smelling that all-too-familiar strong rubber scent from that He-Man figure. It's like smelling the rubber kickball at school. What's so interesting to me is being able to wear that smell. Of course, there are various notes in there to make it smell pleasant, and most everyone here loves this fragrance. Just like many others, I was also confused by this scent when I first sampled it at the store. When I saw a small bottle for sale at a discount, I bought it ($25) and gave it another try. I really do like it, but its performance is lacking. There isn't much projection, and it's a light skin scent after two hours. That actually is a benefit because I live in Japan, where people don't like smelling cologne (they find it offensive, yet smoking indoors is okay...go figure). I don't think this is a woman's fragrance; that rubber smell maybe too odd/strong a note for a female. Also, I love how the bottle has a rubber ring around it. Bvlgari Black is another Annick Menardo creation I have stumbled across. Unfortunately, I don't love this creation like I love some of the others (Eg. Au Masculin) and I barely ever reach for it. 
At the opening, there is a prominent tea note with vanilla and leather. Agree with others that the opening reminds me of rubber/fresh tires with vanilla. The vanilla for me is a cheapish vanilla scent which can be compared to cheap vanilla car air fresheners or cleaning products. This ruins the fragrance for me. 
The fragrance is pretty linear too and doesn't change much into the drydown. 
Projection is fairly weak and longevity is average for me. It's pretty much a skin scent after the opening and lasts about 2-3 hours on my skin. 
Bit disappointed given the hype and perfumer. Best try before you buy and judge for yourself.

Scent: 5.5/10 I love this sooooo much, it's a skin-scent on me, clean but still very interesting. Does anybody know if this is dicontinued or not? I see it in online shops but it's not even mentioned on Bvlgari's website. This fragrance was created in 1998, but it smells to me like RIGHT NOW. I've never smelled anything like it. It reminds me of new plastic doll scent with a light scent of tea leaves, smooth rubber, a kiss of vanilla and rose and a tinge of leather that's barely there. It is not a strong scent, but it projects more than one would expect, and also lasts for a while. 
I don't think it's a safe blind buy. I bought it blindly and happened to enjoy it and appreciate it a lot, but I could see a lot of people being grossed out by it. It's really a weird, unisex scent. In my opinion, it's not perfumey or cologney in nature. It does have that ""mmm, grrr..."" factor. I would love this on a female, like many of the fragrances I've written reviews for here. God bless! This is a very nice floral scent. I wore it today in 65 degree wet weather and boy did this bloom!! I could easily smell it and it performed for about 5hrs. I love the bottle and need a backup because it's been out for awhile and probably wont be around for long. I recommend this to both genders. This is a definite underrated scent that will be missed when gone. Leather, rubber, vanilla. A conundrum of complexity and simplicity. This is a well-composed fragrance with a soft, leather drydown. It reminds me of an English gentleman for some reason as it's quite clean and refined. This is a like for me, but not a love so I have a bottle up for swap - message me if interested. Lovely fragrance. Unfortunately, this turns into a skin scent within minutes. Exact same performance as Burberry London. I would put this fragrance under the ""stay-at-home-and-cuddle"" category. i´ve got megacompliment today with bvlgari black passin´by a lovely milf who has known me and she started to shout out in front of her husband: daaaamn, yoooooou smell soooo delicious !!! ... it says more of her than about the perfume itself :) ... the bipolar psychology works !!!! This fragrance is about two things: rubber and vanilla. The rubber is quite dominant for around two hours but the two notes meld together very harmoniously, playfully, and dare I say seductively after that. I rarely feel like wearing this but when I do it's not something anything else in my collection can fill. Best matched with synthetic fabrics and dark colours. Great for lovers of the Y2K aesthetic. If you want the smell of Prada Luna Rossa Black or Midnight in Paris at a much lower price, you should definitely consider this fragrance!
For more, check out my review of Bvlgari Black on my Youtube Channel:
The Scentrovert Modern, mysterious, soft and seductive. This was way ahead of its time. Such a buttery vanilla with a velvety new tire smell. I was anticipating a cumbersome, jarring and sharp latex note, but that’s far from the truth. I find this fragrance actually quite welcoming and warm rather than industrial. 
I do wish it carried on longer. It projects only a few inches from the skin, even upon initial application. Sillage follows you very closely as well. After about 2 hours it’s practically non-existent on me. However, the price is right for the pleasure of having it in my collection. For quiet date-nights or close encounters, this would fit the bill nicely. yeah, really not digging this. To me it smells like furniture cleaner with a really strong ''rubber'' smell. First initial wearing —
I was very shocked at how good this scent is ! With all the reviews saying this had a very off putting ,burning rubber ,tire smell I was expecting a very unique but daring smell. That assumption was partly correct but that tire smell on my skin smells like a very clean tire shop or the smell of the interior of a new car. In fact, this is a different scent than the typical freshies out there but it’s very pleasing to my nose.
This opens up with that tire smell but then quickly transitions to a fresh,leathery smell thats rich,sensual and actually smells kind of like a luxurious soap. I get a lot more tea than most are mentioning and also in the drydown I also get a clean marshmallow vibe like the reviewer below stated. I’m really digging this in the colder weather and it’s also very relaxing to my nose.
Performance on the first wearing was slightly disappointing as it’s a great smell but doesn’t project very much. It does leave a nice Sillage trail though which is the strength of this fragrance. It only lasted me about 5 hours which is average.
Overall rating— 7.5 out of 10 ! Unique and pleasant scent but it loses points with performance.
In comparisons to midnight in Paris I would say they are very similar but Bvlgari Black is more rich,less powdery and more masculine. However,I don’t think Prada Black is very similar to Bvlgari Black in terms of smell but they do have a similar vibe.
Fiancées thought— she thought it was pleasant but nothing special. Also she thought it kind of smelled like a shoe store but it was still nice.lol Cleanest non pungent soft creamy new tire/ leather jacket roasted marshmallow (not camp fire) smell that is never cloying at all and dries down completely clean. Certain occasions when you’re bored want an aura change but keep it subtle. Another scent I had been meaning to buy for a long while. The first spritz tingles my nose with its alcohol component. Within one minute I get a big hit of vanilla (that came quick!). There is no trace of that humid rubbery goodness I had noticed from a test years before (had it been reformulated?). I really have to imagine it being there. I try again later and that rubber characteristic is faintly there, but only lasts for a few minutes. After half an hour I smell an interesting wet clean smell, almost powdery - it smells good on my skin. Dry down is ambiguous; slightly floral or grassy, powdery, vanilla. The projection on this frag is terrible. After three minutes or so I can barely smell it two inches from my skin. Longevity is okay, maybe four hours.
Update: Weird - after trying this scent on and off for a while somedays I get that rubbery note. Today I am wearing it and it smells especially good. I can see why people compare this to Midnight in Paris by VC&A, but on my skin it morphs rather quickly into Peace by Kenzo. No surprise, really, as they are both by Annick Menardo. I got a 40Ml bottle of this legendary and now discontinued fragrance online for a song. Worth it for the splendid rubber slick-tyre enclosed bottle alone. I sprayed it with some excitement and not a little caution expecting a great roar. What I got instead is a very beautiful balance between a slight rubber and something grassy and citrus inclined. The opener also reminded me of my grandmother's garage in the 1960s which never housed a car but had a combined smell of petrol lawnmower, creosote, cobwebs and now long-banned garden chemicals. This odd note quickly disappears and it continues in a very civilized but altogether low-key way. The main thing which confounded expectations for me is just how faint the rubber accord actually is. In the film Fantastic Voyage a nuclear submarine is miniaturised and injected into a scientist's brain so that it can seek out and destroy a blood clot, save the scientist and the secrets he carries with him. If you imagine putting Santa Pod Drag Racetrack into the same machine and then hiding the result an a little wheel-shaped bottle you have Black. God this is good. What a gem of a blind buy.
10/10 for me The fragrance starts off with a burnt and biting scent, seemingly characteristic for rubber containing high amounts of plasticisers. Albeit not identical, the smell of the rubber covering the flanker can be taken as a point of reference. I do not know whether this is intentional or whether it has to do with a reformulation. These plasticisers, certain types of phthalates, are harmful to our health and they are increasingly recognised as environmental toxins. It then develops or weakens into something which is less biting, more round to some extent and reminiscent or remotely reminiscent of almonds for some reason. I would describe this as a lighter violet in colour. The sweetness which accompanies the rubber element might have proven rather interesting on its own or in an altered composition. Through the rubber, the fragrance seems to attempt to inspire an urban romanticism, but in contrast to what is claimed in the marketing description, wearing a scent of sweetened plasticisers seems neither rebellious nor sensual but rather senseless to me. And this is politely speaking, my first reaction was that it is a perverse expression of human recklessness raising questions about worthiness and survival. I think of it as a debatable artistic statement and this makes it hard for me to recognise it as a masterpiece. Not that I have anything in particular against the perfumer or the commissioning company, I mentioned that there seems to lie potential in the sweet element of the fragrance. However, I believe that they, as well as those who follow along without too much thought, need to be held accountable in a certain sense. It may be the case that there is nothing new to say about Bvlgari Black. I'm another person showing up to sing its praises--
This was a very lucky blind buy. About twenty minutes in, I'm fascinated by how this one is kinky, cozy, and wholesome all at the same time. Underneath the shell of so-delicious-that-they-seem-edible rubber and leather there is a warm-blanket, powdery core that smells like laundry right out of the dryer, emphasis on the heat! I don't mean a clean laundry musk, but rather that cozy, fuzzy smell. I had heard a lot about this ""rubbery"" wonder, so I wanted to try it out... and the result was it blew my mind. The rubber note is right there at the opening, very organic and not ""plasticky"" at all, yet modern and edgy, reminiscent of 20th Century machinnery. Then there's the leather, like expensive italian leather goods, not outdoorsy or animalistic, refined, polished. For a sweet note, deep, whisper soft vanilla. And the shadow of a drop of resinous cedar.
The last traces of dryout keep very close to the skin, and do not last too long, so I would suggest to have an extra spray on your lapels or a scarf.
On a man I would consider this an alluring scent, for a woman, this is the perfect power scent: strong, out of the ordinary and just the right amount of subtle. my substition for midnight in paris (which was more feminine) 
but this .... this is lovely - the same vibe - but more masculine So I am work and I'm checking in shipment, in this shipment is a tester of Bvlgari Black so I sprayed it and the smell was so familiar and I just couldn't remember what it was and then it hit me....It was the smell I remember from all the Greyhound bus trips I took when I was a kid. That's not a bad thing, I think it smells good. Maybe this scent has been reformulated ? When I first tested Bvlgari Black in a store several years ago, the first spray was a blast of fresh new tires smell, like walking into a store that sells brand new tires. It's NOT burning rubber, just fresh new rubber. The first spray died down within a minute, and the rest of the fragrance was a very airy, feminine sweet powder with aromatic leather. Nice !
I love my current bottle, even though it lacks the initial strong fresh rubber scent blast. The leather is rich, smooth, excellent, stays through out the dry down. This newer formula lacks the sweet powder of the original. Wish it projected more.. It's almost a skin scent on me after about a half hour. Still, it's pretty, slightly sweet and sultry on my skin and lasts about 6 hours easily. 
I wear Bvlgari Black day or night, any time of year. OK for office wear, since it's non offensive, unisex and unique. It's also the only Bvlagri scent that lasts on my skin. On a girl it's really edgy and interesting I would wear it when i feel daring and admire it on another woman.
But on a man..mm yummy stuff. BB is one of those fragrances that brings back memories. I remember this scent from the old days and recently rediscovered it.
It is a masterpiece and I especially love the top notes and it is extremely pleasing in the 1st 30 min of wearing. It is certainly unisex and in fact it leans toward being femine after the initial petrol smell is gone. For me that makes it a 'home fragrance' that I am not willing to really wear outside.
I have to say that despite its magical scent, performance is terrible and it becomes a skin scent very quickly. In that sense it certainly is a short-lived beauty.
Scent: 9/10
Sillage 5/10
Longevity: 6.5/10 This perfume is a masterpiece, and it is for only a select few unique men and women who can handle it's leathery, rubbery sweetness. I LOVE it. I had been on the look out for it and managed to find it in a small perfume outlet. When I sprayed the tester on myself i didn't know what to think of it initially. It confused me. I let it settle and I could smell the rubbery note, but it was so subtle. Then I started to detect the note of tea and vanilla. It was so puzzling but uniquely good I had to buy it. Now that I have worn it a number of times, I am soo glad I have this in my collection. There is something kinky and dirty about Bvlgari Black; but not in an in-your-face way. It's simultaneously delicate and earthy. It has this natural quality to it - almost like the way someone's natural skin may smell. It wears very close to the skin. The rubbery note is profound, but I love it, and I feel sexy every time I can smell it in the initial spray. My boyfriend finds it very sexy when I wear it. I love wearing it on a rainy or foggy day, or whenever I'm feeling a bit sassy and moody. I cannot say enough good things about this perfume - it's so grungy and magnificently alluring. I have no idea how I had never stumble upon this masterpiece of perfumery while being a perfume enthusiastic for years. This is absolutely AMAZING. I had read all those reviews here and it was literally a blind buy.
Not really strong, not really overpowering, just a comfort herbal burning plastic vanilla that blows my mind. I really love it! To be honest I thought that this might be a bit strong, too wintery but this is not the case. It is almost summer here in Greece and this one performs really nice, being airy and comforting. It is not an overstatement to say that this is niche quality - an amazing release from Bvlgari!

instagram.com/scentsexual After so many years of reading good reviews about it I finally decided to add Black to my perfume collection. In his guide Luca Turin gave it a 5 stars rating but named it hot rubber...I hate the smell of rubber and certainly don't want to smell rubber. I though Black will be strange and not wearable. It's not the case at all. Black is different but really beautiful. On my skin I don't detect any trace of rubber like Tar by Comme des garçons. It's soft but at the same time have a strong presence and personality. Absoluty no trace of flowers in it. Very urban. I like it. I always thought that loving a perfume meant that I would automatically want to wear it.
With time, I've noticed that there are certain scents that I admire greatly, while not really ever wanting to wear.
Bvlgari Black is one of them. It is seriously one of the most unique perfumes I've ever tried: a bitter powdery, rubbery leather, with a smoky vanillic amber halfway between Shalimar and l'Air du Desert Marocain. It has this herbal greeness to it that really makes it shimmer throughout the day.
But I just can't imagine myself putting it on. For as brilliant as I find its composition, I don't really think it would ever suit me.
Who knows! Maybe I'm just too much of a traditionalist.
Either way, Black is weird and wonderful, and would go great on somebody who is likewise weird and wonderful. Bvlgari's Black is very nice - a great unisex gourmand combination of soft vanilla and smooth leather, very likeable and comfortable. It's just a solid like for me, however: leather is a note that I rarely dislike but only sometimes love, and then most often when it's combined with (stone) fruits or floral notes, so it's no surprise that this one doesn't quite make my heart beat any faster. 
I could have chosen a much better day to test it than this almost summery day in April, though: it's the kind of comforting scent that's obviously made for colder, darker weather. So I'll revisit my little decant again next winter, and who knows, I might still fall in love with it then. This fragrance has definitely 100 percent been discontinued. You can still as of now get a bottle off of amazon. If your a fan of this fragrance I would buy now before it's completely gone. If you don't believe me that it's been discontinued talk to a Bvlgari customer service representative like I did and they will tell you the same, and it has been removed from their website. From the house of Bvlgari and the legendary Annick Menardo [YSL Body Kouros, Dior Hypnotic Poison, Diesel Fuel For Life and Boucheron Jaipur]. 
This is a great Vanilla and leather scent with impressions of burning rubber, very sensual and urban, I like to wear it on fall / winter nights in the city, it was way ahead of its time in 1998 and I still love it now, great value I recommend it for men even though it is unisex. Smells weak, you have to spray at least 5 or 7 times to smell it, and once you do it smells like rubber. It's really basic and bland, nothing exciting or even fully developed about the scent. Wish I could write a better review, but I'm much like this scent. strange how the vanilla reacts with i dont know what(saffroline?) but rubber smell is produced.my sister thought it was hilarious as a theme in keeping with the bottle.she picked up on the vanilla instantly and i noticed the le male type right away.odd how le male and the cuba cologne use of vanilla doesnt change but bulgari's does.it leaves the rubber scent behind and also the le male and goes into a vanilla powder scent.i am just blown away by how close it gets to the smell at the walmart tire section.very nice! longevity is not bad at all,projection is not too good though but okay becuase sillage is mostly openers i guess. Testing it now back to back and smells like ""Midnight in Paris Van Cleef & Arpels"" the only diference is that Bvlgari at the oppening is more robust, fills more your sence of smelling. Which one is better? The longevity will tell. I know it's a pointless compairing since Van Cleef & Arpels is discontinued and it's difficult to get one nowadays. I bought this in '98 wehen it first came out
I always thought of it as a softer companion to amen. It's strange smoky and beautiful.
But..it's hard to wear. I think it's more suited for a woman but yes a man can wear it easily. The only thing is that although i really like it, I just don't reach for it as much as I should. It's like the notes block eachother out or it's just too simple-what you get in the beginning is what you get in the end. I would consider it a modern classic yes.
Those early bottles would all leak. initial blast is of tires but after 5-10 mins it mellows down with beautiful vanilla note which is very nice , this is rather the best Vanilla note i seen around . Fun to wear. Fun concept. I remember trying this a decade ago, gagging and wondering why anyone would want to smell like vanilla flavored condoms. Fast forward to now, trying it again, I am loving it. Heat, rubber, tea and a little bit of something sweet. It kind of makes me think of the smell that hardware stores have. It's enjoyable and strangely comforting. Black is a perfume by Bvlgari brand known for their 19-century jewelry. It appeared on the market in 1998 and is one of the most avant-garde perfumes ever. It was designed by Annick Menardo, one of my favorite perfume creators ever, with such creativeness and refinement in mixing the unmixable that Bvlgari Black, one of my favorite perfumes ever, can be seen as a genius perfume and work of art.
Black is a simple, linear perfume but it is not striving to be any different. Like black and white photos, the colors are scarce but the emotion is more alive, direct and dynamic. All the notes open at once, warm vanilla and a dry scent of new tires. Its a punch and a dare for every nose, but a punch you don’t want to recover from. Try it on your skin despite being skeptical over the scent of a tire on the skin. When you put that aside, you will notice that something is constantly forcing you to smell the perfume on your skin.
There is something animal, intoxicating in this perfume. It’s a bit perverse. Ok, it's quite perverted.
This is a perfume Anastasia and Mr. Grey would wear if the book and the movie had any substance. But because they don’t we imagine them sprayed with sugary water. Black is not sugar water and it cannot be used by everybody. It requires a leather jacket or pants, dark sunglasses, bed hair and the “I don’t give a damn” attitude. It’s ideal for modern rebels. Disobeying the rules (in school, work or bed) never smelled better.
It is designed as a perfume for men but its nature is unisex. It has a small aura and a sillage but it stays long on skin and is meant for you and anyone who dares to gets close to half a meter from you. There are no rules when to wear it, just wear it freely and without limitations. We make our own rules and break them. And smell phenomenal along the way. Bulgari Black is fun because it has multiple meanings for me. I was a teenager in Tokyo in the mid-2000s so I can't quite shake the association of Black with sleazy guys who hung around Shibuya and Roppongi with their creepily thin eyebrows and pointy shoes. When perfume and mean-funny Turin reviews became a mild obsession in my mid twenties, I bought a decant of Black and my first reaction to it was ""ew, I remember this"". 
It only took three wears before repulsion turned to love - it was like that with Palazzo. With Lolita lempicka it was two wears; with Patchouli24 maybe three. Annick Menardo has a way of messing with the edible and inedible - at first it can be confusing but if you know perfume then you'll know it's special. I had a mini bottle of this for many years but never used it, I have no idea where the bottle went.
Now I got a sample couple days ago - I had difficulity opening the vial, once I did I accidentally dropped it where it fell to the ground and spilled all over the floor- so I guess this will be my first and last time trying this out.
it's basically like you've morphed into a leather couch for the first couple minutes - but then it mellows down to a more vanilla black rubber scent. 
It's interesting for sure- BUT..... I wouldn't get it to wear personally , though.
Very weak sillage and longevity, it's been a couple hours and I can barely detect on me right now
This states it is unisex, but I feel like it's more of a men's scent than anything- a very strong type of woman can pull this off too probably. I am in love with this perfume! It's definitely one of my top faves. I cannot believe I'm just now discovering this and its been out since the late 90s, which is when I started becoming overly obsessed with perfumes. It seems like this perfume smells somewhat gourmand or like an oriental vanilla, to my nose, and seems way more feminine than I thought it would be before I got it. I wish the sillage was stronger, I find myself spraying all over myself and my clothes, at least 10 times! But hardly anyone can smell it. I received my first compliment yesterday about how good I smelled! It wasn't overpowering they said, because i asked, they could just smell a little yumminess when I walked past their desk. The way I'm going, using so much, I feel I'll be buying a new bottle every couple months! But considering its not overly expensive I don't mind. :-) If anyone knows of another scent that is very similar to this one but with way more sillage I'd love to know about it. I recently purchased Tokyo Milk Dead Sexy because its noted here that its similar. It is similar but I don't find myself using it as much because there's just something different about it I can't put my finger on. 
7/10 is my rating, would be way higher if it was a stronger scent.
Thanks for reading my review. :) One of the very best gourmands that a guy can and should wear. As far as male gourmands go, all you’ll ever need to be aware of is this, and then „Pardon“, „Baraonda“ (both Nasomatto) and „Dries van Noten“ (Frederic Malle). Oh, and „Bois des Iles“ too, of course, the ultimate ur-gourmand.
8.5 / 10 I enjoy this scent, even though you can kinda smell the rubber I think it blends well with the other notes.
To me it kinda has a soft vanilla dryer sheet vibe, depending where you apply it.
Very classic perfume I can see why it has lasted all these years. Mostly the smoky new car tire smell that slowly gives way a dominant vanilla. Lasts 2-3 hours with very little projection. Aftershave? Lol. I like how some people instantly show their all-around competence. An admirable opinion indeed. Leather, rubber, amber, musk underlined with awesome vanilla. I know it sounds as a weird combination, but it works so well together. Actually the vanilla note here reminds me a bit of Le Male, but without cinnamon.
Black is warm, sensual, unique fragrance.
It is a unisex but don't know many women who would dare to wear it. I wouldn't mind - there's something dirty about this perfume and I like that a lot. I've always wanted this cult classic, and I finally received a bottle this Christmas. Everyone always described it as ""the ultimate bad boy/girl scent"" and to my surprise this smells EXACTLY like one of my favorite perfumes that I already owned, Tokyo Milk's Dead Sexy! The scents are almost identical. A beautiful sexy woody vanilla charmer. Not at all what I was expecting from the way it had always been described to me. Does this scent scream ""bad boy/girl""? No...but it does carry an attitude with it. You definitely have to be in a certain ""mood"" for this one. I'll probably end up spritzing whenever I feel a tad grungy and sassy. I won't be breaking any laws with this one though! Not sure what all the trashing on the performance is about. On me, I tested my new bottle on my wrist yesterday at 8pm, and now it is 2pm the next day and I can still smell the leather-vanilla drydown faintly. Sillage is soft though.
Opening, some say bandaids. Some say freshly opened condoms. i say, the prevailing opinion, its like new tires. Think a brand new BMW, fresh tires and a hint of new car scent. Luxury sports car. That's the opening.
Now lets imagine this in a scenario. Some high-roller is cruising around in his new car until the 10 min mark when he picks up either an S.O. or someone else who has certain intentions in mind and they are wearing cheap vanilla perfume. 
Tires, new car scent, and cheap vanilla.
Then at the 30 min point they get out at their destination: an executive suite at some fancy af hotel. They get out of the car, and the tires fade. In fact, the tires and new car sent evolve into a dry smoky leather. The vanilla in this executive suite changes from a cheap sweet vanilla to a more light, high quality vanilla. And this is how the scent stays. Classy, sensual, leather-vanilla. Unisex in the manner it smells feminine on a lady and masculine on a guy. 
In short, start off as a fancy car with two horny people in it, turns into a classy scent for doing the do.
Unique in the opening, unique in the drydown (except for maybe Midnight In Paris, but I have not nosed that). Give it a shot! I like it a lot. As far as comparing it to MiP from VCA, the under notes are quite similar, yes. The issue with Black though, is the initial blast - and lingering scent of new tires/old band aid smell - you remember the old Johnson & Johnson band aids, came in the metal tin, and the strip was this flexible, rubbery stuff? Exact. Same. Smell. Love it! Was a little worried about all this talk about rubber. Not really looking to smell like a walking tire, but turned out to be not a problem at all. What I get is this clean, powdery vibe that I enjoy very much. I was able to get a whiff of the rubber, but I found it very understated. It was an undercurrent that prevented the powder from becoming too girly or baby's bottom. The overall effect is comforting and, yet, sexy - if that makes sense...Good longevity, ok sillage. From the back and forth reviews, recommend you try before you buy. First impression: why do I need this when I own Lolita Lempicka au Masculin?
Bvlgari Black lacks the magic I've fallen in love with in LLaM. It lacks the licorice and the right kind of powder. It lacks a connection, a story to tell me.
On paper, this reads like my dream fragrance. Unisex with tea AND vanilla? Leather and rose? Woods? Amber? Sign me up! Somewhere it falls flat.
Maybe it's not fair because I have Lolita Lempicka to compare it so closely. Or perhaps it's because I've only given this a chance on Casual Fridays, when a carefully chosen outfit can't elevate the notes and evoke a certain mood.
I'm going to give this one time to reveal itself to me, but for now it's just ""nice."" This is NOT that similar to Midnight in Paris. Yes, it's a similar type of scent, but it's not a twin, or even immediate family... Maybe a cousin or something at best. If you love MiP, there's no guarantee you'll even like this.
Bought and sold in less than 24 hours. Luckily I still have a 125ml MiP. I used six sprays...both wrist, back & front of my neck, chest and front of my shirt.
Will I buy this again?...No.
Does this fragrance enter BEAST MODE, good, just okay or weak sauce at best? Just okay.
What's the strength of this? EDT.
Am i willing to trade this fragrance? Yes.
Should You Skipped It, Sample It First or Blind Buy It? 
Sample it from a fellow fraghead, go to Macy's(free), Sephora(free) or Ebay for a sample of this. It's not worth it in my eyes..
Because i've smelled this before. So this is nothing new.
If you're new to the fragrance community then buy it, if you have 50 plus bottles already you might want to skip this.
Can you use it as a unisex scent? Yes.
Is it the old, new formulation? Unknown.
What's its availability; in production, limited edition or discontinued? In production.

Until next time, I'll catch you on the flipside. It's like a mix of rubber and bubble gum with powder on top. 
Somehow it works. A great winter scent. So bad it got discontinued. However it's still available in many places. I used to wear this, but it is many years ago now. I instantly loved it to death! Why? Because of the car workshop scents - gasoline, rubber, motor oil, exhaust and so on. I found this perfume to be the best ever. But after two or three bottles, I eventually got tired of it, and could not use it anymore. It also became hard to find.
I can't say I remember the other notes. But it was a sweetness there, yes. And wood. 
Bvlgari Black is a unique creation, really fabulous! I still miss the very masculine scent, or opening, like if you just had been in a garage and repaired cars for hours.
If there are other perfumes with the same type of opening, please let me know. Angelina Jolie wear this!! I wish I had the confidence too rock this but I don’t my best friend wear this and he smells fabulous in it. The leather, vanilla and musk smells so good on my skin 
and I can not stop smelling myself with this. 
It's warm, dark and sexy.
Kind of making me think about a person who smokes cigarettes,
wearing a leather jacket, drinking some warm vanilla coffee drink of some sort. It's just lovely to me.
""Cigarettes smells bad"", yes, well I am just thinking of a smoky leather. It's just my fantasy going off.
I'd like to smell this on a man. Some fragrances are not ment to be categorized in the ususal way as male, female, orinental, aquatic and whatnot.
They're conceptual, ment to convey a specific theme or atmosphere.
The grandaddy of this kind is Dior's Fahrenheit, which was an avantgarde thing, concentrated on the idea of burning petrol, flame and finally smoldering ashes.
Fahrenheit was a hit, not because of the idea behind it, but because it was something completely different from what is the norm, or general mass appeal, as parfumes are primarily a business aimed at a wide audience, and common places are a sure bet in revenue terms.
To create and launch a conceptual fragrance, the house must be already strong enough in market terms, so it doesn't hurt the overall business if it flops.
There's a limited number of houses that can afford to do something like that, and lucky for us, Bvlgari is one of these.
Riding on massive successes as Aqva, Pour Homme, Blv, and Jasmin noir
they can indulge themselves sometimes and not be afraid of experimenting.
Black is a concept fragrance, it plays to the limited crowd who like the smell of rubber and it wants to evoke a racing track feel. 
Whoever attended a, say, Formula one, event knows the smell of burned rubber and hot asphalt, mixed with the smell of gasoline and sweet beverages and feminine parfumes.
Black gets it to the very point that once a friend of mine tought we skidded whilst driving when he cought a wiff of this. It's a work of pure art if U ask me, as even Fahrenheit, to which this is sort of a companion piece, doesn't get the burning petrol feel quite like this catches the rubber. 
Mind me, it's quite more than the rubber, as the feeling is softened by the vanilla and the feeshnes of the tea note, but the leather in this is so well configured that it actually smells like you just finished a lap on Nurmbergring and just popped a soft slightly sweet drink just sitting there on the hud of the car and chilling.
Performance is fantastic on the vintage ones (if you can find them), not bad on the slightly older and, unfortunately, rather weak on the newer ones. I have a stock of 2002 and 2004 batches, and it goes easily for 8 to 10 hours with 3 of strong projection and marvelous sillage. The newer ones are 1/3 weaker. Still, this has to be tried by every serious fragrance fan and it's a must in every collection as things like this in Fragworld are rare.
Unique and excellent.
A gem.
Absolute A, one of the few. Perfect burnt rubber smell, a bit harsh but so well balanced, softened with vanilla and I adore the smell. Black also so close to V&A Midnight In Paris but more masculine, I sold my MIP because it was too feminine and creamy for me and got bvl Black instead. My only complain is about performance is so weak, after one or more hour it dissapears, starts like it ll raze everything to the ground and vanishes quickly. Yet, a wonderful smell, I can say a masterpiece. Annick Menardo, amazing nose <3 Ow WOW! I have read about this perfume for years and finally bought it. It arrived 2 h ago. I love it. I totally understand the hipe.
I don't think it is masculine at all, I find it very feminine which clashes with many reviews here. I wonder if there is a dude who can pull this off... so tomorrow I am spraying all my work colleagues :'D with it. 
Very nicely powdery, vanilla and amber. I was playing with Hiris earlier and Hiris is way more masculine imo. Weird that there is no iris note in Black, it would totally match.The rubber note is only noticeable on my skin up close. It is an original scent and I can only recommend it.
Wow! seriously! My blind purchased bottle arrived today and I applied a little spray on my wrist to test it out over what I was already wearing (Prada Sport). At this point I've honestly lost track of how many times I've smelt my wrist on the car ride home from work. When I do get home I plan on immediately showering away my old cologne to give Bvlgari Black a well-deserved 
place on my body. 
Cheers Unlike its bottle, Bvlgari Black is soft and sensuous and not as avant garde as the bottle may have suggested. The low sillage makes it appropriate for daytime wear, but the scent profile is more of a nighttime perfume. The tea note in this perfume and its overall aesthetic is very reminiscent of the au the series (au the rouge, au the blanc). The difference is that this perfume have a leather accord in addition to tea. I would say this is more tame than au the noir, which is more peppery. Bvlgari Black is for rough and tough cats who are soft at heart. I have a bottle of Black, with the On/Off cap that does not come off. So I think it's pre-2009?
But even pre-2009, I still find this lacking in potency/sillage and the lasting power is okay- but light.
I really dig this tho. For what it is... I'm in love with it. It's a fairly basic (generic?) vanilla/leather/rubber with a tea-like dryness. I find it pretty feminine. It's not complicated, but it's somewhat unique for being basic. I'm happy with it. This is a lovely tea scent! I just purchased Black at Ross for a decent price. I have held off purchasing it because of the elusive ""rubber tire"" scent...and while I do get that accord shortly after, it fades and this is just a lovely slightly smokey hot steamy cup of tea.
After it wears on, it becomes sweeter with the vanilla coming through and powdery with soft sillage and medium longevity. Very lovely and comforting I can see myself wearing this a lot this Fall and Winter cozied up to a good book or watching one of my black and white oldies by the fire cuddled up with the Hubby..so glad I bought it... Black is a little like a pleasant, rather insipid person wearing a very cool hat. Black's cool hat is a tarry, petrochemical note in the top that's impressively interesting and must have been unique when it first came out. After about 30 minutes, though, that fades into a friendly but very bland white musk and vanilla scent. Bvgari Black is a fragrance i picked up at a discount store. I read the fragrantica reviews and ratings before purchasing and thought it would be a great blind buy. For me, it was a rollercoaster of emotions. 
At first I did catch all the top notes but they went away pretty quickly, withing 5-10 minutes. While smelling all of the notes after initially applying Black I thought it was pretty good! Then my hopes crashed as after the top notes faded and I smelled the middle and bottom notes together I HATED this composition. It smelled like straight up tires with Armor All on them. But then, it started growing on me. After an hour or so I started to smell more of the leather instead of rubber when the amber began to play. If you like leather and/or rubber you will like this scent. I will say that the amber and a soft soft leather lasts an extremely long time and it quite beautiful. 
I would only wear this in the fall and winter during the day with a leather jacket or rugged clothing. I do not think this is a fragrance that would do well in the cozy cold night unless your SO is 100% into this fragrance, as it will turn people off if they don't like it. So while I think there are better options at night, i would wear this in the evening during cold days and transition to an amber fragrance at night. Pleasant, posh wintery perfume This smells so good I can't stop smelling it. I really love this scent. The notes and reviews didn't disappoint as this was a blind buy. This is one of my new favorites. Something really fresh about it but not in a soapy way. I haven't smelled a fragrance like it I definitely would be okay with an enjoy wearing this everyday. It's an all year around any time of the day fragrance and truly unisex. I will buy this again maybe even as a backup.
So modern to be made in 1998! Ahh why didn't I know about this before 2017. 
Edit: same day I wrote this bought a back up lol I'm only human. A smokey sexy rubber latex and leather aroma on top of the most beautiful soft inviting vanilla. This trio is a very hot combination if you think about it! Bvlgari Black is ""Leather for beginners"" and I do believe it's the vanilla done right that makes it so. Black comes off like the secret fragrance love child of the elegant, modulated Bvlgari offerings and the avant garde notions of Commes Des Garcons. That smokey rubber vanilla note is just weird and industrial enough to be distinct, challenging, and memorable, but not so weird as to make the fragrance unwearable or off-putting. It finds that very, very fine line between both standing out and fitting in. Can be had at value prices and worth purchasing if for no other reason than to reward and encourage inventiveness in the mid-price designer fragrance market. This leans feminine on me, which is not so great since I'm a man. I like the scent, but not enough to wear it on myself. The rubber note doesn't do a lot for me, although the leather is fine. 
Given this leans feminine and has a predominant rubber note, maybe it is ideal for women with a latex fetish. Or a woman who is dating a man who is obsessed with cars.
The scent is quite tenacious on my skin. Washing it off my hand with soap and water the first time only reduced its intensity by about 50%.
The bottle design is great. One of the best looking bottles I've seen. The rubber surround is great for the grip it offers too. No more dropped perfume bottles in the bathroom. WOW. I have never been so immediately satisfied with a blind buy. I smelled this for the first time and thought “yup. this is my signature fragrance now”. The packaging is easily the best I’ve ever seen (although that isn’t saying much considering all my fragrances are basically under $40). But seriously, the presentation is just so perfect for the fragrance and the bottle feels so nice in your hand. Unboxing this felt…spiritual
As for the smell, right off the bat it reminded me of a smoky scotch because of that smoky rubber note mixing with the alcohol smell you get in all fragrances after spraying them. Then it quickly settled into a sweet, soft, rubbery vanilla smell. It reminds me of walking into a tractor/lawnmower store but…..kinky. The rubber adds a familiar working class dirtiness but the vanilla, leather, and tea bring it into a sexual bdsm realm. This is definitely unisex. Leans more feminine to my nose but barely. A masculine person can bring out the more standard rubber vibes of this (like tires) but I think a femininity can really bring out the darker and sexier rubber vibes. This is really special stuff and I don’t see it working on everybody but if it sounds like your thing, go for it.
Is this similar to Midnight in Paris? I would say yes. They are about 85% similar to me. I find MiP to be have a bit more citrus and juicy/herbal nuances in the top, possibly a more complex fragrance overall. Black is more soft and dry. The rubber/leather notes however are basically the same in both. Ooof... this stuff is nice. Black is a powdery vanilla leather. The leather is smooth and soft. Very different from a pungent Fahrenheit style leather. Normally I'm not into vanilla scents but this one has little to no sweetness. A musky, cedar, sandalwood base is in the mix with just a touch of florals. Taken all together I do smell some kind of rubber. I suppose the tea note plays a hand in this? 
Lasts for about six hours then becomes very soft. Detectable on my clothes the next day. Sexy, sensual, date night scent; seems okay for work as well. This is unisex maybe slightly ""feminine"". Good for autumn, winter and spring. Tire/hockey puck bottle is cool and the sprayer works well. My only gripe is the box exposes the fragrance to light. Very reasonably priced but I wish it performed just a little better. Buy it! This fragrance seriously makes my knees buckle. It's the smell of a cool clean tyre shop... an old plush leather couch ... and a hot hot hot mechanic. WOW! This is the scent of my true love. Just heaven. I remember buying this... ripping the packaging and spritzing myself while driving... only to have to hit the skids a few moments later because I lost all trane of thought. I've only smelt this on myself. Heaven help the man that walks by me wearing this. Just saying. Bulgari Black is an eye opener. The opening is provoking. The top only lasts for a couple of minutes. The middle is vanilla and sweat. Not Body odor sweat, but the sweat of a God or Goddess. You know that scent of glistening sweat of the person you are in love with. You crave that smell because you two are bonded together. That is what the middle reminds me of. Sweat of a lover; Sweet and dark and alluring.
I get the the rubber note at first, but it is not a harsh latex smell. I hate that smell, but Black is bitter and a little pungent like real Green Tea in Japan, not the sweetened green tea we drink here in the states. It is not unpleasant. It is mysterious and makes my nose curious for more. I am smelling my wrists and shirt all day when wearing Bvlgari Black. I am drawn to the moment by moment evolution on my skin and around me. 
I was motivated to purchase this blind, based on comparisons to long lost Midnight in Paris. I am not disappointed at all. This scent is great and distinct, yet does invoke a resemblance to the the powdery affect of Midnight in Paris.
I highly recommend this and also thanks to everyone below who encouraged me to buy this with their positive reviews, accurate descriptions and experiences. This stuff really is superior and unique. The only negative is the longevity is below average on me. I get 4 or 5 hours at most from this. I would wear this year round, except for hot humid nights. It is an evening scent for me, just like Midnight in Paris. The reformulations simply destroyed this fragrance. What Bvlgari has done to Bvlgari Black is just as bad as what JPG did to Le Male. I used to love this perfume, now it's just a shadow of its former self. The rubber accord has been so toned down that's barely even there and that delicious vanilla is also as good as gone. Such a shame... Finally after a few weeks I crossed this perfume again and I bought it.
The Vanilla opening wasn't my favorite, yet it quickly disappeared and left with a rubber tea leather combo. Something that is incredible attractive to me. Warm dark and sexy, not masculine, so it's really unisex. I think it's a very good dating fragrance for men because I'm convinced women will like it....and it suits definitely cool and sexy girls on casual occassions. 
I noticed it smells on girls fresher, lighter than on myself. On me it turns warm and heavy. That makes it really interesting. 
Besides Dior Fahrenheit this is really a fantastic perfume for rendezvous. The Sillage and Longevity are quite poor, yet the price is low with around 30usd for 40ml as well. Reapplying or put a bit more is ok then. 8th time around! This time, I have a feeling I'm going to love you more! 
It is a very well constructed scent; rubber juxtaposed against the tea and vanilla. A brilliant scent. Yesterday I bought this fragrance from bvlgari store at amazon.com. I found it all black rubber and vanilla
It start with citrus note...then some note like rubber...and dry down is vanilla..Not a sweet vanilla but Black is a sexy dark scent..The rubber smell is strange, but at the same time very sexy...This one is really unique...smell like sexual fetishism...good for my collection...so forbidden fantasy! I recently acquired Black, after having purchased Man in Black, which is my favourite Bvlgari scent. Having read so many conflicting accounts of this perfume, I was pleasantly surprised about how mellow and smooth this scent actually is. Yes, it has a rubber accord, but it's not a burning, or tar-like smell, it's more suave man in a leather jacket or tux, or the interior of a luxury sports car. A very sumptuous affair, almost formal. I agree with the previous comments here, that one imagines a man in a classic bond-like suit, that is, it smells more expensive and regal that it costs.
I love it: it’s clean, almost powdery in the dry down, with vanilla in there, it’s sophisticated, and can be easily worn in formal gathering settings and sensual dinner dates alike. It has become my preferred Bvlgari with Man in Black, by Morillas. 
In a word, if you liked Bvlgari Man in Black, Pour Homme, or Notte, you will like this fragrance, and like myself, probably love it, without a shadow of a doubt. The kind of fragrance that compliments a stylish look, and fortunately is in fact not a challenge to wear, for neither sex. Wear it on a date, wear it at home, when you just want to feel like “your worth it”. Possesses a lovely dry down, and the sillage is borderline beast. This should not be classified as a ""cult fragrance"" for a select group of perfume wearers like the way Encre Noir is; no, Black is for everybody. So get ready to tap your leather hat off to Annick Menardo and go ahead and try out this little gem from Bvlgari! I just tried this and it was really disappointing. I didn't find any smoke, any rubber, any leather. Just smells like nothing with a touch of vanilla. 
What a waste of time reading reviews saying that this is awesome. Blind bought this one, for a luckily cheap price, but i'm not impressed, made me feel a bit nauseous with that burnt rubber smell in the opening. it's like your inhaling a plastic bag thats on fire... 
the dry down was the only redeeming bit of the frag, but reminded me too much of Midnight in Paris, which i also wasn't a big fan off. 
yeah its different and daring and i appreciate that, but smell-wise it's not for me at all.
if you're after a Bvgari scent, you can do much better then this one, in my opinion, i'd recommend, Man in Black, which is a different beast altogether. I think this fragrance must contain macrocyclic musks because I can smell virtually nothing. Back in the 70s, I used, as a teenager, to drench myself in Musk by Jovan - I bought some again recently and it smells a lot like this, only better. A real disappointment. I get the faintest whiff of musk, then nothing, then another faint whiff a few hours later. Most odd. This is AWESOME!
I love the opening smell of smoke and tires - it smells amazing.
Definitely not an everyday perfume but a good one to have in your collection.
Very sexy and different! Don't let the leather/rubber open note misguide you, it's a cozy 'fell good' fragrance all around.
The mix of green tea, vanilla and bergamot is divine, it makes this fragrance so relaxing, specially at cold weather!
The only problem is performance. It becomes a skin scent after 30 min. 
This is the type of fragrance you'd wear for yourself, when you are reading a book, drinking a tea, etc. People around you probably won´t smell a thing after 30 min, unless it's a really intimate interaction, so it's not suitable for clubs and dating.
Scent 9.5/10
Longevity 7/10
Sillage 4/10
My ''feel good and relax'' scent! This fragrance deserves a lot of praise, as it truly is something special. In a sea of Axe-imitators with over the top vetiver and musk, Bvlgari Black manages to be a daring and masculine without relying on tropes. Despite the notes to be fairly conventional, they combine to create a unique fragrance. That doesn't mean it's for everyone, or that you will like it at first sniff. I sure didn't! But every time I came back to it I smelled more and more complexity and appreciate it in a new way. On me, the leather comes out strong, and perhaps a bit too sweet. Otherwise, the composition is fairly balanced and would make an excellent unisex scent. Absolutely masterpiece from bvlgari. Unusual, strange and different from another else.
That's may be hits or miss. Revolutionary fragrance in 1998.
Highly recomended try the vintage batch. Its rock everythings, if.. you can handle it.
Fresh, sexy and also muskuline. 9/10 Black is undoubtedly one of the best leather notes on the market, very well made, simple, clean, powerful, with a very convincing mixture, basically appreciates a very aromatic tea, astringent, dry, giving the cadence, a Central note of leather with nuances of rubber rubber and vanilla drying to sweeten everything in the right measure and without touching the gourmand.
At times it makes me feel like I'm inside a luxury sports car, brand new, with leather seats.
I find it suitable for the most demanding public who wants a good note of leather available and without stridencies.
Black is all a basics that I use very often, is much better than many niches out there and also at a price of laughter.
A masterpiece of classic perfumery !!
Rating: 9.1 If only it performed better. This is pure sex in a bottle. 
I use it only for close encounters, i don't know if i would use it for a first date, maybe a date when you know you're going to be really close and you should do at least 5-6 sprays on the neck/chest area as this would not project more than 2-3 inches away from your skin for the first couple of hours. 
Longeveity by the way i would say is average, you get around 5 hours before it sits as a smoky/powdery faint vanilla skin scent. The first time I smelled this I wasn't ready to wear it, it was ALL man--specifically a man in his 20's. Very urban outlaw. Maybe a guy who works with his hands, drives a motorcycle, and wears a leather jacket. Yeah, that type of guy that women notice. This is often a signature scent for men, but on women it takes on a bad girl whose into leather (if you get my meaning) and a little darkness. A definite mood changer. However, it's a phantom of what it once was. Bvlgari perfumes don't last on my skin anyway, but this has definitely been reformulated. I have a bottle from May 2015, and I remember smelling an entirely different scent in April of 2009.I remember the date because we visited a perfume shop while on vacation, and it had more rubber. Now it has more tea and vanilla. Reformulated ten years ago. That's why the're so many negative reviews. It WAS rubbery, sexy, strong and very unisex. Angelina Jolie was wearing this stuff.
Nowadays: nada! The initial blasts were vanilla-heavy and a ""metropolitan bakery run by the yakuza""-accord was doing my head in. With 1/3 of the bottle destroyed a smoked tea note has emerged and it is a delightful thing to have. I honestly do not get your dirty läther fantasies at all, this is just a really laid-back scent that puts you in the zone. A bit more strength and power would be appreciated though. I'm having a really hard time with this one. The alcohol scent is so strong that I miss any initial scents and once its faded it smells like baby powder. If I really concentrate I can pick out the rubber and leather, but it's buried under a powdery smell that is similar to baby oil. I tried it a couple times on myself and it's all powder.
Than I had the idea to try it on my boyfriend. Mmmmm a bit of cedar and than super-vanilla. Imagine if you were to polish a nice oak cabinet with vanilla. No rubber. No leather. Sadly no delicious smokey tea. Just rich woody vanilla. It's not his taste, but I think it's yummy. Well, Yesterday I bought this fragrance from bvlgari store at amazon.com. You smell the perfume at the first spray then it disappears. No one can notice it on you so that you don't receive any compliment. The ones who said they get compliments, I think they mean the compliments were from someone get them hugged because this is the only way you can notice it. 
The smell itself looks creepy, It starts with the SANDALWOOD note then settle on LEATHER. In fact it smells like a TIRE. 
I give an overall of 3 of 10 i blind bought it years ago, and didn't like..keep it in bureau..about two days ago i tried it again..this time i like it, the rubber scents that bothered me back then, grow on me, i can smell floral and woody balancing in the air, the rubber's still there but smoother and more natural ..wonderful,
longevity 7.5/10
projection 6/10
scent 8/10 I love this unisex fragrance. The leather and rubber notes are subtle but unusual, particularly When worn by a woman.
I've just finished my second bottle of this and will be buying another as soon as I can. This has become a winter signature for me.
UPDATE
Just for the hell of it, try layering this one. I did it with Tabu 🤗 Ohhhh! I had a craving for this warm brooding scent for so long and didn't realize it until I bought myself a bottle. You ever have that happen? Like you crave some scent but you cant figure out what you need and then you get a hold of some juice and it's like YES! this is what I wanted. That's how I currently feel with Black. Its a grounding and comforting scent. Its smooth and luscious and round. The smokiness warms me up here in the winter months.
I notice lots of people think this is hard to wear or find it odd. I don't get that at all. It is unique for sure, but its very assessable imo. It has a niche feel to it, but it's not over the top in what it has to say. 
In a nutshell Black is a dark, brooding, somewhat serious perfume. It demands confidence and surety, but at the same time it's disarming in its powdery innocence. It's a smoky, leathery, vanilla, with just the perfect amount of amber. The green tea adds just a bit of freshness to it, making it easy to wear even in the summer. 
It's weird I used to wear this scent a few years ago and got away from it and now I cant figure out why. This is so me. Signature territory honestly. This perfume has shot to the top of my want list! Thank you no-fi for the generous sample! 
On first application, there's a wall of amber and vanilla mixed with cedar on my skin. The leather is there, too and quickly rises to the forefront and says ""I'M HERE!"" in a big loud voice and then backs off a little, letting the other notes do some kind of sexy hotchpotch dance where they mingle delicately, let loose, each having a moment of attention and then join hands again in some kind of whirling dervish of notes.
Jasmine pops up, musk settles it all in a background kind of way and there's some greenery coming through too, combining amazingly with the jasmine and leather, just when I was thinking this was totally oriental! I love it! A juxtaposition of notes that work so well together and ever changing. How does Annick Menardo work this kind of magic?! Nothing vies for dominance on my skin and just when I think ok, bummer, the rubbery vanilla leather has gone, I get a whiff of it again. The notes come and go in a changing harmony. 
Beautiful, stunning and a heap of other adjectives in that vein. 
Longevity and sillage so far are a little subtle but will give it more time, I could eat my words. Off to look for a bottle now. I tried this at a shop yesterday, but I didn't like it; it's like they had blended 60% BLV Pour Homme and 40% Jaïpur Homme. It's too sweet for my taste, but it fades after 1-2 hours of spraying (it seems to be a common trend among Bvlgari fragrances, with the exception of Bvlgari Men in Black, which you can feel after 6-7 hours).
I don't think I'd ever buy Bvlgari Black as it doesn't offer much, and it's not that cheap, either--it's around $33, which is too high a price for what this perfume provides. Unfortunately i dislike this one. It doesn’t develop well on my skin. All I smell is rubber. Not something elegant perfumey rubber, but realistic rubber and only that, nothing else. I thought it will be similar to Midnight in Paris, it kind of is, but only for that rubber note. Midnight in Paris has also vanilla and sweetness to it, Bvlgari Black has only rubber. The scent itself is fascinating, somehow they managed to create a smell of a car tires, rubber tubes, gasoline, plastic canisters with gasoline, rubber tubes with gasoline and car tires. It is fascinating yes, but I would never want to smell like that myself. I was hoping to get a smell of leather car seats with a hint of flowers and musk, all I got was the smell of car-service workshop. Anyway, happy to test it, otherwise I would be thinking about it for ages. Try if you like realistic rubber scents with no vanilla, flowers or musk. The bottle is gorgeous in reality though, lucky those who like the scent as well. Opens up with a very original, rubbery leather that blends with a warm, nice vanilla note. The name fits perfectly, it conveys the idea of a sexy black leather jacket with rugged boots worn by someone that shows great confidence and drives a fast sport-car.
Due to the tea-note, can be worn all year round, it's quite versatile in my opinion as it's a refined, nice leather.
Bvlgari Black is a unique and refined leather scent with an untamed, sexy vibe.
9/10 The 100 Days Challenge - Day 24:
A vanilla Lapsang Souchong Tea that develops into a futuristic S&M homage. Rubbery and aromatic, with a heavy cloud that is hesitant between synthetic and natural smelling. Not appropriate for ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" readers, but certainly appealing for Marquis de Sade wannabes. A fashionable statement for Halloween. ¿Trick or treat?
Today's word: Mysterious. Great sweet leather scent. Different enough to be noticed but not so far out there wearing it is a challenge. Good buy. Thank God the bottle looks much better. It`s time to smell. I wish the reviews I had read of this had hinted that this is in *no way* a daring scent. It is light, sweet, rather feminine (powdery-flowery powder room) and somewhat modern. The leather & rubber dimensions are scarcely noticeable under the conventional, safe perfume structure. Mom at a restaurant. When I first smelled this, was taken aback by the initial black tire rubber blast. waited it out because I wanted to see where the scent went and found that the dry down is lovely clean leather and sweetish vanilla, with just a hint of rubber and a tinge of smoke. This totally grew on me and now I absolutely love it. That black rubber phase is short lived on my skin and the drydown is just so good.
At first, I would only use it for layering, but now I usually like to rock Bvlgari Black on its own. Mostly wear it to get that understated edgy-modern feel and also when I go out drinking with friends. Also like to pair it with super feminine outfits, for a different kind of subtly sexy-cozy vibe. This scent evokes everything it set out to because it makes me want to go on a joy ride in gas guzzler with supple leather seats, with good friends and good music while sharing a flask of smokey scotch.
(Review for bottle with the twist atomizer ""cap"") Does anyone else smell the similarity to Donna Karan Black Cashmere which was launched in 2002 (I don't mean Liquid Cashmere Black)? i usually don't like leather, but in this perfume it is not a dead animal around your neck, if you know what i mean... soft, elegant, sexy, strange, something dark and lightly sweet, really a beautiful fragrance. i now wear it and i feel like something fantastic it will happen to me, like an interesting trip, when i am going to see other places, and meet other people, new persons, nice feeling don't you think?? Best of the bests unisex fragrances ,alike Cobachard and Shalimar style...Dark Green Leather without any sweetness in it 
Scary ,I know ...MASTERPEACE,no doubt For first 3 hours or so I got good quality black tea, sweetened a bit maybe, with rubber and beautiful leather. There were some oakmoss accords too, as well as musk and amber. It felt stron and clean in a strange way. Didn't felt much extravagant after all. It cooled down finally to nice vanilla note. I bought this blind based on reviews saying it had a ""rubber smell"" because I'm into the art of perfumery I knew I had to get a bottle, and knowing the main note in this is leather (one of my favorites) I went right ahead and paid $15.00 for a 40ml. 
It smells so amazing I seriously don't get anything that smells like rubber. I smell leather and vanilla mainly along with tea and amber. Vanilla usually really turns me off because I hate anything too sweet and vanilla based fragrances are kinda feminine in my opinion, but this is so balanced to where the vanilla never annoys me. This is not feminine at all to my nose it smells masculine if anything. I could see a woman wearing it tho (hot!!!) I was expecting it to be very off the wall but it smells a lot more agreeable than I had envisioned which is not a bad thing. It's still a ground breaking fragrance nonetheless, not one that followed the crowd by any means. 
It's such a shame that it projects quite well but not very far. very much a personal scent... maybe spray the back of your neck to get a trail going. The longevity is decent tho, above 6 hours. I will update this when I do more testing.
Smell 10/10
Projection/Sillage 6/10
Longevity 8/10
Uniqueness/Timlessness 10/10
This is a must have for any man or woman who can appreciate the art of fragrance, or likes leather. Yes it is basically a little bit more than a skin scent It's more than worth the money and you don't need every fragrance to be on that beast mode level.
I will forever own a bottle of this it smells amazing! I enjoy 'Black' on other people, but unfortunately my skin amps up the rubber until it drowns out everything else. Occasionally I get very faint whispers of vanilla and amber, but then they are drowned out by the overpowering and nauseating smell of rubber again.
While I do appreciate the artistry and the concept, I can't wear it to save my life. 
If you're planning on buying it and have never tried it, test it first.
5/5 stars for the concept and idea. Unfortunately, with my skin chemistry, it is 1/5 stars, as it's unwearable. Did not like it when I tried it in a store, but when I wore the same shirt the next day, I couldn't stop sniffing my sleeve! It's addictive and beautiful, very soft, a bit sweet and sexy. I'm in love now, got myself a bottle =) I bought this based on its reputation and have worn it only a couple of times. I didn't hate it, but it was not love at first sniff either. I am going to hang onto my bottle and test drive it again in the future as some of my greatest perfume loves I had to grown into somewhat slowly. It's interesting how Bvlgari Black can play somehow the concepts of the 90s and still be a perfume more dark that many aquatic and fresh creations of that time, being thus among the most challenging and artistic. I have already reviewed it in the past but this is a composition worth going back to study. If you stop to think, structurally speaking there is not much of a difference from Black tp CK One, you realize that its monolithic aroma is an effect of a construction made of musks that oscillate between the softer and slightly animalic. However, the way it works vanilla and an abstract mineral and slightly smoky accord of Lapsang Souchong tea gives such musks a rubberized and sweet aroma that is urban and modern until today. It is a perfume that illustrates very well the contemporary trend in which we live where creation must quickly show its facets - on the skin or on blotter - and keep them throughout the evolution. Black was done by a perfumer I admire - the wonderful Annick Menardo, the creator of Hypnotic Poison. Bvlgari Black was the first of the abstract realist fragrances, which gained prominence the following decade. Its followers explored accords such as ink (Encre Noir) and pencil shavings (Carbone), with results as workmanlike as they were nostalgic. Black, however, was not merely abstruse and conceptual - it was sensual, too. Much of that has to do with the choice of source material; Black explored the darkly sweet nuances of rubber, a note that is as mundane as it is fetishistic.
In Black, the rubber is sweet, leathery and vanillic; it is also warm and sensual, but somewhat aloof. There isn't much evolution to the scent, and its performance is not strong. However, that is also true of the scent it most inspired (Midnight in Paris), and Annick Menardo's next masculine hit (the anisic gourmand scent Lolita Lempicka Au Masculin, released two years later).
While grappling with Black, one must also stop and consider Menardo's pedigree here; in the same year, she composed Dior Hypnotic Poison and Boucheron Jaipur Homme. That's a pretty good track record.
Black is by no means a perfect scent, but it is a vital taste of what was to come. It's a must for fans of abstract realism, or even gourmands. A definite must sniff. Damn I'm conflicted on this. 
First blast is hot rubber and sour wood. Gut wrenching really. But give it ten minutes and the leather and vanilla really shine through as the rubber fades away. But give it another ten minites after that and it's just plain gone. 
I can barely smell it on myself point blank, nose to skin. What a shocking disapointment after that powerhouse opening. What the hell happened? 
The opening is a 1/10, the very very fast drydown is a 7/10 and then the very very fast final settling is a 1/10 for being the exact antithesis of the opening. 
I want the initial drydown to last and to project, it would be a smash. As it is? I can't ever see a reason to use this bottle I bought. This is a tougher, S&M version of CK be. When I wear this, I don't detect any citrus or floral notes. I get a little tea, sandalwood, and amber, but mostly...VANILLA and LEATHER. This blend of notes is very nice. While it manages to be smooth and refined, it is still provocative, but you wouldn't feel out of place wearing this anywhere.
Smelling this evokes images of Bettie Page, Sweet Gwendoline, and Tom of Finland. Have your safe word ready when you put this on. Love this stuff. Sensual. Perfect for a date. Initial blast may be a lil offputting for some, but after that a smooth leather-vanilla
ride. Highly reccomended. Plus the gorgeous bottle. 9/10 Ad un certo punto mi sentivo come questo fosse un pezzo mancante del puzzle, prima o poi lo avrei comprato, senza poterlo provare perché impossibile trovare un tester, un chiodo fisso. Oggi non ho aspettato neanche di tornare a casa e in macchina ho scartato e spruzzato.... Una bombazza di vaniglia sintetica, dov'è la gomma bruciata? Dove è il nero? Io che amo i pneumatici e se potessi dormirei con della gomma al posto del cuscino, io che anche con 40 gradi quello che riesco a sopportare è oud 27 o ombre fauve, un oud noir o al massimo un encre noir.... Diciamo sensuale se non sentito da troppo vicino, altrimenti rischia di sembrare che mi sia strofinata un arbre magic.... Solo se amate la vaniglia. Questa è la mia personale opinione e sulla mia pelle. This is a very enigmatic scent.. Tea, smoky rubber, vanilla. I smell all of this and what is most mystifying of all... It works! These notes blended very well together there are no rough edges or awkwardness here. My only complaint would be the bottle is really awkward to spray, and I think there is something wrong with my sprayer as liquid leaks out around it when I go to spray :( this was an amazing bargain find $25 for 70 ML at Ross. I was on the fence for awhile with this one cause I was afraid the notes wouldn't work together but I'm so glad I took the plunge this is a unique and wonderful gem. I have mixed feelings about Bvlgari Black. I love the bottle, packaging and overall concept. Scent is weak to me. The first spray reminded me of a Tire Repair Shop waiting room with the dominant scent of tires mixed with a tree shaped fake rose scented car deodorizer, and an old wooden table holding well read newspapers and magazines. The dry down is sweeter. So, I'm glad I stuck with it resisting my urge to immediately wash of the waiting room scent. My long time love. Purchased it in Sephora with my live-in at the time who loved it. I have a soft-spot for unisex, masculine type sexy scents. This was my third experience into that genre after Kiehl's Homme scented shower gel and Donna Karan's Chaos. It was early 2000's and I fell in love with Black. It's still in the front row of my collection. Although, I do think I enjoy it more in the Fall and Winter months. It's gorgeous. Art. I really like this one. It reminds me of a hypothetical Diesel Plus Plus Feminine L'Eau, a really sheered out version of that one. That same guilty pleasure rubbery/sex toy/plastic note but without the creamy coconut and considerably fresher and watered down. Different on paper, more of the rubber comes out. Brilliant concept.
Disappointing execution.
Sadly lacks longevity, or sillage.
However try it out, hopefully it works for you!
Breaks my heart as the combination of rubber and vanilla makes me weak at the knees.
If only I didn't have to bury my nose in my wrist to smell it after 3 hours. Love this one, it's favorite from the Bvlgari house so far. I know it says unisex, but I have a hard time imagining a woman pulling this off, it smells pretty masculine to me. I have no clue how burnt rubber, vanilla, and leather and work together to make this amazing smell, but it certainly does! scent : 10/10
sillage : 8/10
longevity :7/10
100% night fragrance
nice powdery, leather&smoky scent
reminds me of Midnight in Paris Van Cleef but more smoky"
6,02 L'Air du Desert Marocain Tauer Perfumes (unisex) ~ 2005," When I first started this somehow addiction about perfumes, LDDM was one of the first samples I acquired. Back then, I thought it was too much for me, and I went on to different olfactory journeys. Fast forward a decade and I finally bought it. It is an amazing, full on scent, enveloping you and your space. I never traveled to Morocco or India, and I have no idea how a spice bazar or the desert smell like, but LDDM is unique to my senses, and what Andy Tauer created is no short of eternal. Au Couer du Desert (extrait) is also eternal, very similar to the original, with added nuances. There are some fragrances that people go crazy about it, and the market gets inundated of copy cats that seems will never end. They might be good, but you smell so much of it out there that it gets annoying. I am glad LDDM is a cult on itself. Its uniqueness and boldness are reserved for a few that can and always will appreciate it, and of course, no copy cats. Once you start reading up on fragrances you're bound to hear about this one: it pretty much hit the perfume world like a thunderbolt when it debuted in 2005. And you'll see why once you try it (as you should): I've never smelled a fragrance that becomes so bone-dry as this one does. Most perfumes smell juicy during most of the time they're discernible: this smells as dry as can be soon after you apply it, but you still get the wonderful array of spices in it, from petitgrain to coriander to cumin. It's like being in a small Saharan town and smelling a spice bazaar in the sun-baked air: and thus its perfect name.
I can love this and hugely appreciate its artistry, but I just can't pull off spicy fragrances (except for big vanillas). But if you can... well, for what you're getting this is quite reasonably priced among niche perfumes. It's incredibly versatile, and it suggests cosmopolitanism, discernment, maturity, and complexity. And it would be hard for me to think of a more beautiful simple bottle design! Love love this spicy and woodsy smell scent. I feel bold and grounded when I wear this scent. It definitely smells more masculine than feminine. The dry down is what I look forward to in anticipation. I'm a novice when it comes to distinguishing different scents, but I am a lover of amber and vetiver, and the combination of amber, vetiver, and woodsy smells is divine. I can't distinguish between cedar and oakmoss atm; hence, the use of woodsy. -Opens dry and medicinal.
-Reminiscent of the back of a musty closet.
-Linear scent.
-It takes an acquired taste to like this. (-) I agree with seventeen_sails that the natural aspects of this has no gender. I don't ""see"" a man or a woman when I smell this I see sand and dusty, hot, desert shop--a place really. Sure, moroccan souk but I've never been there. I've smelled this dry dustiness a thousand times before: anywhere in AZ, deserts of NV or on vacation in Mexico. It smells like a trip I am desperate to take after >1 year of lockdown. The cedar is most prominent to my nose but I really have to focus to start picking notes out; woody but has a soft, clean sweetness. As if one is freshly showered and primped to spend the day out shopping, eating, exploring in the hot desert sun. It. Is. Just. So. Beautiful.
Edit: 1 spray on the back of my hand lasted into the evening after multiple hand washes (8+ hrs). That said, my bf found it a little masculine with the woods. I might agree so this would be a ""for me"" scent. It doesn't project all that much so my 3mL decant might be just enough in that regard. Still, art...this is art. This is strange. I have come back to leave a review after 3 months. When I first bought this I hated it. Revising now and wow this is a masterpiece. The first 5 seconds of the opening is incredibly fresh, im getting a lot of the petit grain. Then the birch starts to give It this bizarre smokiness where it smells like something is just slightly burning which is the juxtaposed by the floridity of the jasmine and the labdanum to give this concoction I've never smelt before in any fragrance DNA. Absolutely a1. Then you get the amber dry down.after about 3 hours. The longevity and projection on this thing is also beastly. I would love to be in a group where us, the few strange people who are in, discuss about how can people love this dirty unattractive smell. 
Please, add me in. I feel so alone :-) I've been playing with this recently...
as a moroccan, this is giving me hamam vibes(traditional bath/spa), it also has something of the ""rhassoul"" women use (it's a typeof dry clay used to nurture the hair & skin) which is probably what foreigners get walking around the souks along with the spices..
i find it very warm & extremely comforting... i mostly wear it while going to bed
it opens with a blast of amber & some spices, couple minutes in the vetiver starts to appear it gives it a clean-ish feeling which i love, the veriver calms down in a couple of minutes, it stays in background until it becomes a skin scent... on my skin it dries down to a sweet vanillic amber.
8/10 This is something special. I just did a review about Au Coeur du Desert by Tauer that is the extrait version of this to help decide which would be a better purchase even though our tastes are subjective. But let me tell you as I am testing these two I'm seeing more and more how they develop on my skin so differently and I love the difference. With LDDM i'm seeing that this version is entirely sweeter and way more aromatic because while there are spices and leather in this the spices do not overtake the amber and so this comes off way more vanillic sweet almost on the verge of spicy gingerbread or spice cakes.. ughh it's so delicious. ACDD does this as well but the spices overlap the amber more and the resins take it deeper with the sweetness so while ACDD is a more concentrated deeper version it takes longer to get to the sweeter base a bit but when it shifts then it stays there and lasts longer while LDDM goes to that ambery vanillic type accord from the beginning and it is airy and fluffy and it stays there the whole way. The differences with these fragrances are in the experiences of the textures and the layers that hit you either first or last. And they're so close in some ways some may question does it warrant another purchase. Look at both of my reviews and see what I'm talking about.
Though they are not that far off from each other, they do wear a little differently. ACDD because it is denser lasts longer on the skin..LDDM you may loose an hour or two in comparison to the extrait but they are such dense fragrances they last for awhile. I can see why many say they can't live without both because they are both so close but the differences are there and you wouldn't want to miss out. They are so close many would say just go for the extrait it lasts longer. But there is something nice about how LDDM hits your nose with the amber and it being sweeter. I just ordered LDDM because I want to explore the first one and see how it really works when I spray it from the bottle and I'm getting more samples of ACDD because these fragrances need to be opened up and sprayed and experienced. But from first sniff everyone will agree ACDD is denser. As ACDD takes time to develop that vanilla amber fluffiness is starting to come out more so yeah ACDD will smell allot like LDDM as it develops, but it just takes more time to get there but LDDM is already that way from the beginning to end. I like the way LDDM takes you there first and I feel like once I have had enough of that I would want to go deeper with ACDD. I honestly would not mind owning both of these fragrances. They are just too good..some of the best and as for amber this is competing with Chanel & Guerlain it just has such quality and that says allot about Tauer fragrances...LDDM & ACDD are masterpieces that make you happy from beginning to end. There is unnecessary density. Spices have evolved into a little powdered earth. It is not an artificial fragrance, but it has an unpredictable structure. It's not always attractive. I understand that this is leaning toward what we typically consider masculine, and that some women wouldn't want to wear it- fine. But what about the smell of, like, a tree, is so masculine that women ""can't"" wear it? Anyway, I'm a woman and I wear this. The opening is loud and pungent, a cloud of smoky spices, but after about an hour it's a dreamy dark sparkling amber, spices floating on undulating cartoon scent lines, then it's vanillic at some point, and almost musky near the very end. Throughout it has this dark sparkle, like stars in the sky, or glitter in tar. This really does not work on me. There's something sickly sweet here, which struck an off note on me with the woody spices. This combined with its strength-- I eventually scrubbed it off. Smells more balanced on my husband though, so I suspect it's a skin chemistry issue. I live in the desert and so wanted to like this.
Update: a friend convinced me to give this another shot, and a few weeks later when the weather was colder I did. And wow, what a difference a few weeks and a shift in weather makes! Everything suddenly clicked for me, and I now I'm overwhelmed with how beautiful and strange this fragrance is. I suspect the odd note to my nose was the lavender, which I couldn't make work at first. But now I see it working with the subtle smoky sweetness here, even as it's made spicier and drier in the presence of coriander and cumin. If you had a strong negative reaction initially, don't give up on this like I almost did! It has rewarded my patience beautifully. Very spicy, rich, dark scent, full of character. Lasting power is 10~12 hours for me, but stays close to skin after the loud opening. I like it a lot and feel more sophisticated while wearing it, however, apart from one fellow fragrance lover, no one has commented positively on it, Still, I wear it for myself, especially when I need a psychological boost to get through a hard day. I can see why so many love this scent, but ultimately wasn't for me. Definitely not an everyday scent, for an occasion or place. Leans masculine to my nose. I like this scent, a mix of heavier spice and creamy, sweet cedar. However, the 3 people I let sniff all wrinkled their noses at this one. Sadly, would have to be a wear just for me scent. This is absolutely divine and although the notes don't reflect this - it is quite sweet. It leans masculine but the sweet dry down makes it a touch feminine. Wow, am I glad I just got a sample of this. I think many reviewer's imaginations run away with them.. Does the desert smell like woody vick's vapour rub & aftershave? It does now :/
Addendum: Btw really really masculine. Oh this is a BIG BOY. Really big MAN actually. This is Clint Eastwood. You will need a poncho. Start practising chewing that match. Now spit. This is by no s-t-r-e-t-c-h of the imagination for women. This says MAN n beats it's chest n chops wood. It's got wood. SO MUCH WOOD. Very very hard to remove. Priapic WOOD. Would you like to smell of this for the rest of your life? You will. SEND HELP. My grandpa used a shaving cream that smelled exactly like this perfume. It instantly brought back memories.
I love how this perfume smells but as a woman I can't see myself wearing it. Softly spicy. Comfortable scent for me 😌🍃 عطر جميل جميل جميل، تجارب كثيرة ولكن لم يمر علي عطر يشبه هذا العطر، رائحة من الصعب أن توصف، قد تسبب إدمان، محبوك بشكل يخليك تضيع في ما هيه العطر ونوتاته، حقيقة وصفه أو تشبيهه بعطر آخر قد يكون صعب، رجالي بحت، الفئة العمرية فوق ٣٠ سنة، ليس عطر مراهقين، ناضج جداً، وقد لا يناسب المبتدئين بالعطور ، ولا يناسب من يبحث عن عطر واحد شخصي فقط، رسمي وكاجوال، يناسب كل الفصول في نظري وبشكل أقل في الصيف الحار ، السعر بالدولار في بحر ١٤٠-١٥٠ دولار ل٥٠ مل، وأراه يستحق التجربة حقيقة.. This perfume has nothing similar to Messe de Minuit, I own it and it is nothing like it.
Above all, you have to avoid having ideas before buying a perfume and especially not finding the same aura as other brands.
You can't compare a cat with a tiger.
Some perfumes have similarities, it is true, but not with this one and Etro.
When we refer to a church perfume it must at least consist of incense, for example for Messe de Minuit: Myrhh & Incense.
These 2 components are not part of L'Air du Desert Marocain. To Me, this isn't Desert Air but rather HOME!
In My childhood, I used to live with My Grandparents in a small town. My Grandfather always brought home fresh Jasmine flowers from the market, for My Grandmother to wear in her hair-do.
Whenever My Grandmother made Dal-Tadka (Lentil Curry) wearing Jasmine Flowers, the entire house would smell like the duo of Jasmine & Spices, that's Andy's L'Air du Desert Marocain! It will always remain as a special fragrance to Me personally...
In 2015, on My Birthdate We moved into Our New HOME and I wore LADDM during Graha Pravesh (Opening Ceremony).
No matter how far I may go away, but LADDM always grounds Me to the place I call Home!
Both LADDM & Au Coeur du Desert are a must experience ritual in one's Lifetime.
THANK YOU ANDY Appreciate the art behind but not for me. For sure does smell like a moroccan desert. Very interesting fragrance that has worldwide acclaim. I only found the name fairly inappropriate. This frag - in my opinion - has nothing to share with moroccoan desert but much indeed with a catholic church. 
In fact, the very thought that crossed my mind when first smelling this was: Gothic Cathedral. 
Plus a Baroque Catholic Church with ongoing mass celebration.
This is very similar to Messe de Minuit.
Be sure you hold yourself tight when you inhale the wave of cognac (=spices, woody aromas) and the ink-like sensation, like medicinal, oud / patchouli like. Then you'll be submerged by the incense. Even if it is not listed in the notes.
Throat burning, and very very strong. 
A huge balsamic /green note, lile juniper adds. Smells quite masculine, all in all (i would not market it unisex, but masculine).
The drydown is the best part, is smells vetiver and cedar wood. Creamy and nice.
There is something high and mystic in this frag. But it's nothing I long to be associated with. 
So please, have a sniff, but ponder thoroughly before buying. It’s just okay. Too sweet for my liking. Must be the lavender patchouli combo. It’s a good composition though. I’ve sampled it three times and the most recent time I also got a synthetic plasticky vibe. Not worth the money IMO. This is a gorgeous rendition of an open air Arabian spice market. I don’t even like fragrances like this and I’m impressed and lured in by it’s rich, warm, ambery, spicy, woody beauty. It’s exotic, deep, almost smokey, thick richness, and dry like the desert of it’s name. It does entreat your imagination to go to far away, hot, arid, unfamiliar places in the Middle East where Laurence of Arabia might have been filmed. If you love spicy, deep, dry, orientals try this gem. I am a person with an open olfactory mind. I love perfumes and I have been looking for something strong but this one has made me nauseous. It is such a strong smell that it makes you feel bad. I have been trying for days to assimilate and understand this fragrance but it has not been possible. Other people say it's 10/10 but for me it's 1/10. 
Instead I suggest “Oud Satin Mood” by Mason Francis Kurkdjian. This one is a real masterpiece. smells like the renaissance/magickal/fantasy shop in my neighborhood, plus vanilla. A lot of times I smell a perfume and think this smells like this and that smells like that. 
I have desert Moracain on my hand right now from a decant and this doesn't smell like anything I have smelled in perfumery. 
The hype is real here; Mr. Tauer has somehow figured out how to capture the desert in a bottle 🏜
What an olfactory treat 👏
It smells dusty and mysterious. Its hard to explain this fragrance. 
I have this fragrance on one hand and amouage jubilation (another fine creation) on my other hand. 
I am drawn more to desert moracain to keep smelling the spray spot. 
Often I find hyped fragrances to be somewhat of a let down. But this is not case here, this is FANTASTIC.
It makes me feel like a mysterious desert nomad, Indiana Jones, and an Egyptian archeologist. 😄 Masterpiece, this is simple complexity. It can be viewed as risky when you look only at the notes. Certainly exotic that will stretch you and if you don't start at a 10/10, your score will rise as your wear this more and more. It is an amber, it is unique and is being copied more and more now but there is only one original. It will complete most fragrance wardrobes and does deserve the high accolades it recieves. Rather complex. I quite like it, but I alternate between thinking it's just decent to really appreciating the depth. I will credit Andy Tauer with successfully embodying the dryness of the desert in a scent. That's a tidy bit of synaesthetic alchemy. I think powder plus wood plus spice just manages to transport you to a dusty Sahara-bordering city.
Edit: I upgraded to ""love"". I'm still not sure it is full-bottle-worthy or whether it particularly suits me, but it is a fantastic fragrance. What can I add to this beautiful masterpiece. At first sniff I was not sure if I ever smelled something like this before. At the second sniff I thought „this is different“. At the third sniff my colleagues at work started to ask „what are you doing?“. This scent is mesmerizing from the first second you put it on. It transports you into the underground corridors of Sacre Coeur. Incense, sweet spices, never annoying. You feel like you are in an old armenien monastery in which cistercian monks burn holy scents. Rosarys and other holy items come into my mind. The heartnote is what Andy describes by Moroccan desert. The dry down is a beautiful amber. Not too prominent, but noticeable. Longevity: 7+ hours. The juice gets stronger with time. Rating: 9/10. A truly unique experience. What can I say. It was love at first whiff. This is a gorgeous contemplative cocoon like fragrance. As if you are wrapped in a blanket under a dessert sky filled with stars and smoke and swirls of aromatic herbs. It is dry and woody and smoky and incensy and herbal in the most gorgeous way. A meditative, transportive little gem. I picture this scene where it’s sundown and the spice market somewhere is about to close the temperature is going down and a gust of dry wind rolls pass the place... you holding a bag of dried fruits. The animals left and what’s left are the left over hay....it’s the transition heading into nigh market. It’s where everything feels slowed down and still... yet there’s a buzz in the air. This is an introduction for what niche perfume can do. Its a reminder that I wear perfume for myself and that is ok . This doesn’t make me feel confident, beautiful, sexy or a million bucks. This makes me feel content. Dry, airy amber. By ""dry"" I mean it captures the dry desert air. Transparent and gently diffusive. This would be a good ""safe"" niche choice when you want to smell nice but still want something interesting. Nothing i can say that hasn't been said. One of the GOATS and I actually love wearing this in high heat during the summer Full of the Tauer DNA and performs well for an EDT. This thing is a chameleon; opening warm and aromatic, like a spice market in the desert, before morphing into an earthy vetiver/patchouli. Like all Tauer perfumes, the transition is clear, but smooth. There's a lightly floral, woody quality in the crossover. In the end, you get a journey of sorts - from a desert, to a garden, to a riverbank. A more ambery and less spicy and masculine version of memo African leather (maybe even better longevity) .. Such a beautiful composition the spices work well with that blend of Amber.. That fragrance might not be the most versatile but definitely very easy to like.. I think date situation is the best occasion for that one..try before you buy as this one is very niche taste.. And even niche price 😄
Crazy but might even consider it the niche version of dg the one! The art of Perfumery
LDDM was a blind buy for me. to be honest, I was expecting something weird, shocking, and a really hard to wear fragrance, but it was a mindblowing amber fragrance which you should know how to use and treat it. there is no ground left to question andy tauer art of perfumery. it's a beautiful composition with two main movements! the first one, the uproar of the spices with a touch of really soft petitgrain. the second movement is the emotional dance of the amber, on a dry and solid wooden stage. 
tauer's 50ml bottles are not intended to be oversprayed or for daily uses or even to be used as a signature scent. it for the moments and events which means alot, and needs to be recalled after some time. 50ml bottles are more than enough for years. 
the downside of this fragrance is only that it reminds me a little bit of lonestar memories. the amber in both are somehow identical, but lonestar memories is more resinous than LDDM. (LDDM is more wearable than 03).
I'm so happy that I finally have this piece of art in my collection. however I do not recommend blind buying tauer fragrances, especially if you are new to the fragrance world. it's not just a smell. it belongs to the group of perfumes that you must dedicate time to appreciate them fully.
10/10 for the scent. the performance for me is also 10/10. Warm-woody, sweet-spicy, and very, very dry. It’s aptly named. It really does smell like warm desert wind shifting the sand from a piece of bone-dry driftwood that was left behind by some mysterious, long-ago tide.
Unfortunately, LADDM is far too dry for me. Fragrances much less dry than this one have a tendency of turning arid on me. LADDM is so dry it seems to shift off of my skin like fine sand, leaving only a faint, dusty spiciness behind. It’s a skin-scent within the hour.
I can see why some would love this. In fact, I feel like the love many people have for LADDM is closely mirrored by my own love for YSL Opium—a fellow warm, spicy oriental. Unfortunately, LADDM is not another such love for me. It’s too soft, too airy, too dry; none of which are objectively bad qualities, but all of which are the opposite of what typically works for me in a fragrance. Wonderfully warm, deep, rich, elegant.
Neither masculine nor feminine, the notes are grounded in amber, cedar, patchouli, oak moss and vetiver.
Dancing above these base notes, floating higher, with subtle intensities, are spicy notes of coriander and cumin.
And flowers of jasmine, geranium and lavender.
Labdanum and pettigrain add grassy and honey notes.
It is so balanced, so expertly, that when you put it on, you feel embraced, loved, desired. 
There is grace and harmony and a symphony of notes that play together, like an orchestra.
If you wear this on a chilly day, you will warm up. If you put this on before you go out to dinner, you have added just one last touch that will make you feel dressed. 10/10, this is everything I look for in a fragrance. It has a lovely amber, spices and an ""incensy"" feel (even though incense is not a listed note). I could not wear this every day, this is way to special for that. The performance is also great, with three sprays I get 10+ hours longevity and decent projection for a long time. I would recommend every fragrance enthusiast to try this fragrance. I am new to perfumes and just got a bunch of samples from Luckyscent. This had been recommended by several people I know, and I was excited to try it. On first whiff it is a dead ringer for Cleopatra Tocca, which I got a bottle of maybe six years ago and have recently been wearing again. Must be the Jasmine and Amber combo? But there is a nice smoky, almost incense-y note in the back of my nose, like a campfire burning in the distance. And some almost savory leathery notes in there as well. Strangely now that its dried down a bit it smells like Cleopatra again! It would feel redundant to buy a bottle of this, but it's a nice, slightly more crackly version of that mysterious, vaguely old-school feeling I get from Cleopatra. I can detect all the notes abow. Nice but so not what I imagined. Not much of a desert. I can see Hercule Poirot wear it. If you ever happen to go in a church in Italy, get close to the candles and smells around them. The drydown of LADDM smells exactly like a church after a ceremony.
For some reason it projects like a monster on my wrist, I sprayed it half an hour ago.
Very interesting and good but I'm not sure if I would wear it though. I give it an OK because it is a like that I probably will not wear. I have been using this fragrance for the last couple of days (lows 32F to highs of 50F). It has low sillage, but excellent longevity. 
The first notes I detect on the opening are slight sweet and moderately spicy with only a hint of lavender. It works very well with my skin chemistry. 
The dry down is exquisite. Throughout the entire work day (office) and into the evening I am reminded of the scent's presence with a mild cedar note and the right amount of greenness from the oakmoss and vetiver. The mild powdery amber note is also omnipresent.
This is high quality juice and reasonably priced. It is unique and I would recommend buying a sample/decant first. It’s an amazing feeling when a perfume can transport you to a place that you have never been to before. I spray LDDM, close my eyes and imagine myself in the middle of a desert, such a unique experience. 
I do pick up some of the listed notes; mostly coriander and amber but i think with this one, it’s all about the blend rather than the notes individually and this is an exquisite blend. The only downside is performance, it doesn’t have good projection and doesn’t last for so long.
I have to deduct 1 point for the lack of performance but other than that it’s a masterpiece that i think every fragrance enthusiast should smell at some point of their fragrance journey.
9/10 This is a strange scent. I found it very interesting when sniffed from the bottle and I liked it on somebody else, although I didn't find it as unusual or revolutionary as some reviews seem to present it. On me though, I could not bear it. And by that I mean I got an instant headache, stomachache and a kind of heart burn, and I had to wash it off with soap and washing up liquid to make it disappear ASAP. I had never had such a violent reaction to a perfume before, ever. So I guess it probably is unusual and revolutionary in a way. Difficult to wear, but lovely fragrance. Hard to determine when I would wear this - not for the office, not an everyday wear, not an outdoor activity... maybe a special occasion? Sweet, dry, woody... keep wanting to smell it. Nothing like I have experienced, though very pleasant. The price is a little much but worth a decant IMO. 
I was no help on this. I did like it though. At first I didn't like or appreciate this fragrance. Once I spent some time with several wearings and experienced the development, my opinion changed. A very unique note profile that is different from anything else in my wardrobe. LADDM performs well in the cooler months, especially with the amber woody base. A lot of strong notes that fluctuate back and forth (mid to base) without being a heavy fragrance. Check it out and give it a few wearings. A unique and enjoyable olfactory experience. I would not say ""disappointment,"" but LADDM does belong to a circle of fragrances whose reputation has never matched my own experience. My anti-Pantheon, I suppose. 
To me, there is a really pleasant amber that reminds me of the drydown sillage/background tone of, say, Amber Absolute or Ryder, plus an extremely linear and potent metallic ""spice"" note (coriander + cumin + tinfoil). It's like wearing two extremely different perfumes, as these accords seem to exist in parallel realities without harmonizing. And it's hard to wear because that spice note is sometimes evocatively dry and crackly, but more often reminds me of that childhood sensation of biting aluminum foil with a metal-filled back molar. Do you know this feeling?
To be fair, my feelings may be influenced by the fact that I accidentally cloned (quite successfully) the expensive and hyped LADDM by mixing an Amber Absolute knockoff oil with a huge dose of offbrand ISO-Super and a bit of overproof rum (of all things). In a blind test, the result fools my friends and families and they usually prefer my accidental potion which lacks the surgical glint of LADDM's spice accord. 
Mine cost about $20 per 125ml to make.
Others in my anti-Pantheon include Timbuktu, Chergui, Tobacco Vanille, Musc Ravageur, Grand Soir, and Creed (especially Aventus, but not BdP which is beautiful), Elegant spices. For especial occasions. A very good perfume to have in the collection, original and classic,excellent hold it takes little. I had to delete my last review due to me not ""getting"" this fragrance at first. Guess I was expecting a fireblast of species, but this is not what this thing is about.
Take the name ""Air of Moroccan Desert"". This thing flows like the wind. It's a nice thin layer of clean, fresh species that are not meant to invade your aura, but rather make it better and make you feel at peace. 
This is a masterpiece with low projection, but great longevity. Oriental and fresh. Best kind of citrus, best kind of species, best kind of amber gris, at a very reasonable price (119 Euros).
I think everyone should own this, but better try before buying. 
However, I would just disagree to people praising it as the best fragrance they've smelled, merely on the fact that such statement is purely subjective.
9/10. The dry down keeps reminding me of terre d'hermes. Surprised to see no one mentioning it. It's not just me, even my wife mentioned the same. 
It's a beautiful scent, lots of people spoken about it already, so nothing more to add. @subwayeatfresh 
Thanks for taking the time to express my own thought / experience with this scent (I was too lazy to write a review here)
I have a small decant and I really love it and I feel I should buy a full bottle because this is a masterpiece, a staple in someone’s collection ... but every time I want to pull the trigger, I just don’t, I realise I wouldn’t wear it, I don’t crave for it.. and then I end up buying something else 🥺 Certainly Tauers magnum opus!....
I have a bottle of this which I purchased maybe 2-3 years ago. Most bottles I buy and don't wear I eventually sell... I don't sell this one because it is indeed a perfume masterpiece..
BUT...
I don't wear it... its more than 50% full and its only a 50ml bottle I think...
Why don't I wear it?
Simply put. it smells so amazingly unique, spicy, leathery, woody to the point where I actually can't find a use for it.
Sometimes a perfume can be so unique, that it feels like it doesent suit any purpose. I am not going to rule out why it isn't a Winter VS Summer.. Casual VS formal.. because I can't. I can't put my finger on why I personally feel I just cant wear this? - I LOVE The scent.. it's astonishingly unique, powerful and beautiful but never, regardless of weather or occasion does the bottle look at me in the collection like it would be a good choice. I never ""feel"" like wearing it even though I know how good it smells.
Perhaps it's just a simple as I love the smell, but the smell isn't my personality or style...
Anyway. its a masterpiece. its Tauer's masterpiece and kudos to him for creating something nice and bold and his signature style.
If this were a painting, id love looking at it, but wouldn't hang it in my house.. just doesen't go with my decor! (Man, what a good analogy)
;) i don't know but this scent gives me massive nausea Aaah, its a masterpieces. I tend to like this than black Afgano. This perfume is in my wish list, but as i read the reviews, most of you people can have free samples of it, or you can go to a mall and test it , i really hate you... lol
I live in an island in Greece, Chios its name, and i do my best as a perfume collector, blind buy disaster, layering my old juice and reading your reviews with enthusiasm 
Cheers Oh I LOVE this fragrance. After my YR Rose Oud wore off this morning, I put this on. This is what I wanted Dior's Dune to smell like on me. Dry and spicy. A touch of something very faintly sweet underneath to keep it from going dusty. I understand all the references to a spice market in a dry desert, very appropriate. I can pick out a lot of spice and perhaps a tinge of incense, although my nose isn't attuned enough to identify each note. The longevity was amazing on me. If I put my nose up to my wrist I can still faintly smell a tickle.
As I write this, I'm eyeing my two new babies that just arrived...La fille de Berlin and Le participe passee...which should I try I wonder. (I also wonder if it is some sort of blasphemy to speak of loving Tauer while lusting after Lutens.) Vraiment très beau! Ce parfum est un voyage...
L’originalité est folle! Il est unique!
Le mélange des épices et de l’ambre gris est merveilleux.
Pour moi il domine masculin...n’est t’il pas trop dur pour une femme???
Je réfléchis.... This was one of my entries to the world of niche fragrances.
Does it smell like the desert in the Maghreb region? I don´t know, I´ve never been to Morocco. It does however certainly evoke the images that Andy Tauer paints so masterfully with this perfume. It is spicy, intense, at times gourmand, at times even fresh ... so many facets and layers, it is certainly a piece of art.
It is a beautiful fragrance to wear on a fall or winter day, or to just spray in your house to enjoy at home. This is by the way something that often comes to mind when sniffing Tauer´s fragrances ... they are not the most versatile to wear, but they would make beautiful ""room fragrance"".
Performance is excellent, even though it is only a so-called EdT Intense.
Scent 10/10
Longevity 10/10
Projection 9/10
Sillage 8/10
One of the most unique fragrances out there, perhaps the very definition of niche. Simply beautiful!
Andy Tauer also handles most of his customer service himself, and he is such a sincere, down to earth and genuine guy. [L’Air du Desert Marocain]
DRY - MATURE - EXOTIC 
Whilst not smelling too similar to Beau De Jour, I do see where @meroo is coming from. The dry down of the Tom Ford does suggest a dry coriander spice and almost sticky element like the amber in LDDM. 
I wouldn’t go as far as to say LDDM and Beau De Jour are 90-95% comparable (not even 50%), however there is some continuity during the later life of the Tom Ford and the early stages of LDDM. 
In any case, L’Air du Desert Marocain is justifiably a very popular choice of people in the know. There’s nothing I can add to the conversation, however I’d just repeat what many others say in regards to how beautiful and masterful LDDM is. I enjoy this, it’s a comforting fragrance.
The opening did smell like generic cologne to me, but this quickly passed and I find honey is the most noticeable note for me and the spice and incense is right behind it.
Nothing is overpowering though, all the notes blend together in harmony. I keep smelling my wrist and catching different notes each time. it’s warm but smooth, exotic, creamy, smoky and sweet. 
Smells like desert air at night. 
If you like artistic fragrances I’d give this a go. It’s quite an oriental gem and a must-try, but I don’t think I enjoy it enough to purchase a bottle. @meroo
I do not mean to insult you or your nose but your review is pretty misleading. This fragrance has absolutely nothing to do with Beau de Jour.
I mean like 0% resemblance... The definition of a transportive fragrance. As soon as I sprayed it I felt like I got a whiff of dry desert air in a spice market. I have yet to smell an opening quite like this. Everyone interested in fragrance should at least sample this.
Also, I find it odd how many Middle Eastern or Middle Eastern inspired fragrances are marked as Winter/Fall scents. You can't get much hotter or drier than their origin. I think this is a great hot, dry weather fragrance. This really does feel like the desert air. At the beginning, it felt so dry I needed a drink of water after smelling it.
As it settles down, the cedar note becomes more prominent, but the sense of dry desert air remains. It's more like an effect than a fragrance. I get the concept: you are in a Moroccan spice market in the twilight hours, and yes I get that feeling from this. Spicy but muted, complex yet soft, exotic yet familiar...this is well done in all aspects. Is well done enough? well, not really. This needs one element that could take this to another level. Something to make it sparkle, to stand out among the spicy oriental genre. Sorry but this doesn't have it. L`Air du Desert Marocain is beautiful, well crafted and so so refined. That might be enough for some folks, but not for me. Part of me really likes this, but I don't need to own a bottle. This perfume for me was quite a let down given all the Youtube reviewer hype which was absolutely false! This perfume is a dry, linear scent as all I get from beginning to end is a very spicy and incense smell which never changes nor developed. I really wanted to like this perfume, but even my wife commented that I smell like burning incense in a church. Totally not worth the money. 
My three P's
- Price 5/10
- Projection 8/10
- Performance 6/10 4th
It’s an interesting airy light sweet spices and herbal blend, but the moldy patchouli ruins it for me. There are many perfumes out there that use this synthetic? type of moldy smelling patchouli I have noticed and it absolutely is a note that ruins a perfectly good scent for me. Anyone know which is the non-moldy traditional patchouli(old school-wore this oil in the late 80’s/early 90 in high school)? Many perfume samples have been ruined for me when I’ve come upon this type of “moldy” patchouli in the blend. Also, when I sprayed this into the air, it smelled like rotten fruit in the garbage bin….:P This leans masculine, but the lightness, sweetness makes it unisex. 6.5/10 I do get the dusty desert market impression from this fragrance – If it were riddled with vetiver sellers.
The very late drydown is my favorite bit from the scent, amber is dominant, the spices are subdued, and the warmth is dry to its core. Unfortunately, the vetiver accord distracts from this tale of Ozymandias earlier on.
Mature by nature, LDDM is a perfect substitute to the more aggressive and obtrusive Terre d'Hermés.
Quality is not an issue. Projection and longevity are great.
Tombstone Blues, performed by Bob Dylan I like it but I don't love it. Veeery well done, though. Nice smelling spices, however the sweet note is a bit too prominent for my taste, as well as the powderiness/fluffiness. Quite evocative but not as much as I expected based on many reviews I had read. Maybe it's that sweetness. That gourmandish vibe spoils the result a little bit. I don't know if this fragrance is an acquired taste, my sample needed time to sit, or it plays better in the summer, but I hated this the first time around. Honestly, was sad I couldn't jump on the hype train. 
Well time has passed and it's summer now. I decided to give it one last try and I cannot stop smelling it. There's something about it that reminds me of the beach, but it's not beachy. Perhaps he has really captured the feeling of sand at night. 
I won't even pretend to know what kind of alchemy is going on in this unique fragrance. All I can say is, if you hate it, try it a few more times maybe in different seasons. I own this and it is a like but not love for me. I go anosmic with this after 30 mins or so which holds back my appreciation to an extent but even so it is somewhat leans more synthetic than I would like (indeed the Caspian Store eBay clone is very close to the original and lasts longer). Anyway a nice spicy amber that is good for most year round but not my favourite spicy or amber frag in my collection. What an amazing creation!! This is highly artistic and you have to have some experience with fragrances to appreciate this. All the reviewers say that this smells like a spicy bazaar in the marocain desert and i absolutely agree! I get the hot sand feeling, woody, very dry, a little sweet and very spicy! It has depth and develops, on the deep drydown (after 4-5 hours) goes from dry,spicy to a beautiful creamy woody like sandalwood scent. 
It's not at all versatile, i can't think a lot of situations that i could wear this but i can't deny that this is a masterful creation. This is a fall and winter, night scent with great quality! The performance is out of this world, 12+ hours longevity and huge projection that lasts and lasts. 
Overall, this is a masterpiece, a top perfumery creation! I don't know if i could ever properly wear it but i would love to smell it for my own satisfaction. Don't blindbuy, sample it first!! This is not an easy scent! If you like beautiful artistic fragrances and want to try new things, this is a must try!! I went to a store to buy another perfume. While waiting until the seller finished with another buyer, I decided to go through the shelves and found Tauer Perfumes collection. I decided to test the famous L'Air du Desert Marocain on my wrist. And it was like BOOOM! This is that kind of perfume which I try and instantly think: all of my life, where have you been?
Loved it from the very first sniff. And not completely because of the scent itself, but because of the feeling it gives. I feel very cozy when smelling this, like wearing a soft and warm sweater in early autumn. It's really comforting and heartwarming. 
Even though it is Eau de Toilette, it lasted all day long on my wrist. And all day, I kept on smelling it and felt so happy. It took me three days to get to the store again and buy a bottle. So.. this is the first niche (or indie depending what your take on andy tauer is) fragance i ever smelled asides from aventus or cedrat boise.
First impression: wtf, can you wear this?
2nd impression: it smells funny
3rd impression: i love it.
As simple as that. I had L’Air du Desert Marocain back in 2011, I got it due to all the amazing reviews from years past but to this day I still believe the fragrance smells a bit too hippy-dippy on me. With that said, I really wanted to love this scent but it does remind me of those hippy roll on oils that you can buy at any outdoor/ farmers market. It is a well done hippy scent, as with all Tauer perfumes the quality of ingredients is excellent so I understand the price point. But the fragrance just did not work on me. Either way, the reviews of this fragrance from its devotees may encourage the blind buy as I did many years ago but I would suggest getting a couple samples and see how it works with your body chemistry at different times of the year. I love it! Top and middle notes are truly masterpiece ! I was already reaching for my debit card, no questions asked...
... however the dry down has me debating ... the cedar is too overpowering for me, leaning more masculine than I would like...
... ahhh decisions, decisions ....
I have to test it against Musc Shamal from Armani, because in my memory they smell similar... I remember getting a sample of this with another purchase and it sat in my cupboard for 3 months. Then one day I thought, hmmm I'll try that to mix things up. Within an hour of spraying i was searching the best deals online to buy a bottle. Such a fantastic, unique, exciting, smooth journey. This scent is amazing, no doubt about it. Sure it's not the most versatile fragrance, but as if people reading this don't have enough fragrances to cover all occasions!
Top 3 all time right here. Performance is great. Back up bottle worthy. This amazing perfume is a contraindication to my skin chemistry and yet it is heaven in a bottle and smells like a thousand angels on me. I have just ordered a full bottle because it is my unicorn. This is the perfume I have been searching for all my life. The smell is so sweet with smokey incense and complemented with rose and white flowers and then there is a touch of wood, a touch of musk and a touch of spice. The fragrance lasts forever on my skin and surrounds me with its beautiful aroma all day long. I never get anosmic when I wear this perfume, unlike every other perfume I have in my collection.
Try before you buy as it is not a safe blind buy or a cheap one either, but I can say, that this scent is androgynous and will smell divine on a man as well as a woman. YES it is unique and addictive. sometime smells like wooden dust plus spices and sometime like varnish.
It evokes a sense of mystery like you are standing alone in Moroccan desert in night.
This is my first impression . I never have smelt it before .Today I got a sample from splash fragrance, India. I am planning to buy it.
My review is comparatively unbiased because I haven't read any of the review mentioned below, but the description of fragrance which is given on Fragrantica.
Only one spray and you will get whiffs of it. You only need 1 spray or 2 maximum. After reading SundaySmells' thoughts about this scent I just had to try it.
Also because I should 'hate' everything about it, since I have a strong dislike for spices. I love resins and amber though.
I love it... For me the most obvious notes are citrus and resins. 
Being orthodox Christian it's hard not to smell church in any scent that has any sort of resin in it, but I just love it.
Other notes are very detectable too, and what's interesting they don't shift as the time goes buy as much as they're all there waiting for your attention to single them out. 
My review would be redundant after all of the others have said volumes, I'd just like to add that this doesn't last even 1 hour on my skin. So buyer, beware! 
I really hope rice bran oil on my skin would make it last longer, otherwise this is a gorgeous money not well spent. Being relatively new to niche fragrance, having stuck to safer more mainstream houses, I finally took the plunge with a blind buy of this much hyped creation. Incroyable! I was a bit overpowered at first with just how dry/abrasive this starts out, truly evocative of what I can only imagine is a fragrant representation of the gritty sun baked Morrocan dessert and accompanying spice markets, the scent of a people. Then Woody. Then a deep resinous amber accord strikes true as the multi faceted scent goes through it's paces, shot through with lavender,vetiver, beautiful. This scent is warming, abrasive, surprising, eye opening, confident and to me a great choice for any enthusiast. I can't do it justice, but just try it! Some reviews were commenting on the similarities between this and Musc Ravaguer, so I wanted to pull that out and sample it along side it before I formed my thoughts. For anyone who sees a similarity between the two, I agree there is a similar underlying DNA that the two perfumes share. However, L'Air du Desert Morocain is the superior of the two in my opinion. This is a very sexy, uplifting, bright, spicy, woody amber. I really enjoy it. For me, this is more unisex leaning fem (whereas Musc is more masculine). It's very pleasant, very comforting, really conveys a beautiful sense of heat and summertime. It's very unique and I'll want to revisit it again in different weather. 8/10 Last night I wore Annick Goutal Ambre Fetiche for the 3-4th time. I only bought it recently.
After a while I was smelling my wrist and it hit me how close this is to Andy Tauer 02 L'Air du Desert Maroccain.
But apparently nobody smells Incense on the later.
To me I prefer Ambre Fetiche, because it does not smell like old church Insence, or outdated. I like it all the way.
I really hated the first 2 times I wore L'Air du Desert Maroccain. Being the first 1-2 hours the worse. In fact I was more like horrified. Like I was in a morgue section of a church. It settles amber sweet and now I find it Oke but it is not something I long for.
But hey, it is in fact the most expensive fragrance I have (125 €/ 50 ML) so I could not just give it up. I bought it for last X-mas. Ambre Fetiche costs almost the same but than you get 100 ML in a beautiful new bottle. 
Although I believe Ambre Fetiche is more linear, it is equally long lasting (12 hours + ) but both are close to skin. I'm not impressed with their performances. But maybe that is just my nose. This is a wonderful scent, that every perfume aficionado should try out. It's really dry - just like the desert. It contains a ton of spices, delicious spices and even more of warm amber. The two play the main roles in this wonderful spectacle, and the result is a perfect oriental spicy fragrance with ton of warmth. You just have to try it for yourself. A slow-burner of a fragrance, in the best possible sense of the term. When I first tried L’Air du Desert Marocain I was underwhelmed: it was a humid day and I thought it smelled like bug spray. It grew on me. Now: in winter it’s a light dusting of spices on a beautiful ambergris base, dried by cedar and sweetened by a zephyr of jasmine. In summer it’s about sweaty spices, dry cedar and vetiver, and here it reminds me more of the desert. Niche, beautifully constructed and utterly wearable. With L’Air du Desert Marocain, Andy Tauer set the benchmark for how to do niche before most people even knew what niche was. On my skin L'airDDM combines classic masculine styles - e.g. the simple elegance of Caron (un Homme / Yatagan) with the herbalish-spiciness of say, Azzaro Homme. This is a really enjoyable scent, although I wouldn't say it's unique for the aforementioned similarities. However, I can see its appeal and it would make a great staple to anyone's collection. Very nice! When I first became interested in fragrance I got a sample pack from Lucky Scent with a few fragrances that I kept reading about on blogs. I excitedly dabbed on a spot of L'Air du Desert Marocain and immediately noticed the strong smell of creosote. Yuck! That one is a no-go I thought, as I threw the sample in the trash. 
About 40 minutes later I was rummaging through the bin digging that sample back out! LDDM had morphed into a magical, multi-layered beauty. Once the smoky creosote phase had passed it smelled like spicy, resinous, caramelized wood. 
This scent is heavy, but there is a dryness to it that prevents it from feeling too cloying. It has an earthy sweetness that I don't consider to be gourmand. I think this is a unisex scent that is good year round. Some might find it too heavy for summer but I wear it in the heat because it reminds me of being in the Moroccan desert. In the cold weather I wear it because it is like being wrapped in a warm blanket. Applying with a light touch will still project and last all day. 
Several strangers have stopped me to ask ""What is that? it smells fantastic!"". Once at a trendy boutique the sales clerk pulled out her phone and ordered it on the spot after I told her what I was wearing. It seems that people who like LDDM really like it. I've just one word to sum up this fragrance: Divine! 
Earlier today I was trying out sample of fragrances which were sent to my son some time ago from luckyscents and they're meant to be 13 'Masculine' scents in little bottles about 1.5 mls. Well, there were a couple of scents which I really liked, and so I decided to write a review for them beginning with this fragrance because it's most definitely my absolute favourite. 
Immediately upon opening, the scents bring to mind a traveller moving slowly through the Middle East, likely the Arabian Peninsula, and having stopped at a bazaar which is filled with not only people selling and buying items but there are numerous hessian sacks full to the brim and spilling over with spices and various herbs, namely of coriander, cumin, and cloves. These three spices are smoothly blended together to make the top note of this beautiful and unique fragrance designed for both women and men. And whilst I had reservations about how this would fair on my skin as a woman, this fragrance actually smelled divine and the mix of Jasmine, one of the middle notes, along with the Vetiver, one of the base notes, give this fragrance it's ability to work on female bodies and not be overpowering nor too spicy or darkly resinous. 
As soon as you have sprayed this fragrance onto your skin a few times - it has a moderate sillage, projecting and still noticeable 24 hours after the initial sprays - you instantly receive a delicious burst of citrusy freshness, reminiscent of the sparkling lemon soft drink called ""Solo"" and of the ""4711"" Eau De Cologne. This is due, I believe, to the top notes of Coriander which provides a fresh and citrusy aroma and it is this top note which you definitely scent as soon as the fragrance is sprayed on your skin. Cumin is another top note which literally gives spice to the fresh green herbaceous aroma at this fragrance's opening. There is also the scent of Cloves which, whilst is not listed in the ingredients, is strong enough for me to believe that Clove is one of the spices in this perfume. 
Petitgrain, another of the top notes, adds to the flush of citrus, providing the scent of slightly bitter oranges to the fresh burst of citrus at opening. The citrusy-spicy aroma is then followed up with even waves of fragrance consisting of a smooth and syrupy Amber and Cedar, giving the Cedar, Spices and Fresh bursts of Citrus a new accent of resinous wood. 
Then, about 40 minutes in, the Labdanum, takes effect. Labdanum is not an easy scent to describe but I'll give it a go and say that it is a resinous, pine-like scent with amber, earth, smoke, and leathery aspects. The labdanum adds a rich resinous and leathery note to the entire fragrance, generating a scent which is a mix of incense, smoke, woody resin, balsamic, and smoky tobacco. This creates an entire new dimension to the fragrance, giving it subtle depths and light and shade which blends in perfectly both for lovers of Amber and with the Amber-like note itself. 
There's then a fresh note of Vetiver which gives the Amber-Spicy-Fresh Citrusy fragrance and its incense-smoke-tobacco-resinous-balsamic depths a heavier, earthy aroma which is similar to Patchouli with a touch of Lemon. Indeed, here the actual base note of Patchouli becomes noticeable and blends in well with the Vetiver, creating a pungent earthy scent and Labdanum wafts up in sweet, leathery dry Musk scents and gives the wearer a touch of Ambergris, continuing the Woody notes from the initial opening. 
The drydown continues the heavenly blend of Amber and Ambergris with the Labdanum giving a mix of Leather and Musk accents along with Spices. Patchouli remains as a mild scent underlying the perfume. And then imagine you are bathing in a hot bath full of suds from Cashmere Soap, Jasmine petals, and Vanilla. These uplifting scents are joined by Lavender, Birch, and a hint of herbaceous green freshness again but instead of the initial Citrusy top notes it's from a mix of Birch and Oakmoss. The base note of Geranium provides a lemony green scent which is also a little peppery, mixing with the remain of the Spices that run throughout this fragrance from its opening to the drydown.
This fragrance, L'Air du Desert Marocain, is not only a divine Spicy Oriental perfume but it evokes images of travelling throughout the Middle East's Arabia Peninsula and its bazaars full of resinous spices and herbaceous Citrus spilling out of hessian sacks whilst the air is redolent wit the warming aromas of Incense being burnt on braziers, Ambergris and Amber mixing on charcoal briquettes to provide beautiful resinous balsamic and spicy aromas which now and again are accented by the scents of sweet florals like Jasmine and lemony green Citruses worn as essential oils on the skin of the many women moving through the bazaar. 
This perfume evokes not only the image of a Morrocan desert on a hot evening but travelling along the Silk Road with the famous explorer, Marco Polo. Once you delight in the initial opening of Fresh, Greens, Citruses, Amber and Ambergris notes, you are vividly recalled to the spice markets and bazaars which Marco Polo, trained as a merchant as well as embarking on numerous diplomatic missions, not only wrote about but stopped at and explored. This fragrance brings to mind Marco Polo exploring these bazaars and spice markets, the resins and herbs, the beautiful jewellery and the plush multi-coloured rugs that decorated the walls and floors of the bedouin such as those in Morocco which this perfume's name indicates. 
This fragrance has been written about as ""one of the most popular in the line"" of Perfumerer Andy Tauer's fragrant creations.] and this is stated with good reason. Composed of Spicy Oriental notes and inspired by Saharan deserts in the moonlight and evenings in Morocco, the perfume is suited to both women and men and its mix of Woody, Aromatic Amber and Balsamic, Soft and Fresh Spicy accords with its perfect blending of the various notes so they blend seamlessly into this absolutely divine fragrance more than justify its expense. 
It is ideal to wear for any occasion but it seems particularly suited to warm evenings and winter nights by a crackling bonfire, and to being worn to special occasions because it is, after all, a unique fragrance and so suits unique and special occasions, such as celebrations (from birthdays to anniversaries and Weddings) and to make an impression at a job interview, to occasionally wear to the office, and on a night out whilst dressed both warmly yet elegantly, in a little black dress if one is a woman or a business suit if one is a man. 
This fragrance is beautiful, sophisticated, classy, elegant and unique and suits women and men who are intelligent, mature, creative and imaginative and know where they're heading in their lives and careers. It's not for the indecisive, the immature, nor for those who are afraid of challenge or change. This perfume is for the creative, confident and classy. Picked up a good sized selection of partially used, mostly niche samples for a ridiculously good price.
This was one of them - a tiny 0.5ml remaining - and I'll be honest, it's just amazing. Nothing too 'out there', but just a wonderful, Western-appropriate oriental that is a perfect, subtle-yet-present blend of the notes.
Think I'm going to have to scour samples - and perhaps full bottles - for the rest of the line. This is signature scent worthy stuff and I want to know what this smells like worn 'properly', whether it's masculine enough (for me), its performance etc. I can understand the cult status around this, and imagine it was really special 10-12 years ago. Less so now perhaps, but still very good.
EDIT: 13/7/20 - Coming back to this having finished a second sample and I'll say as good as this is, and as groundbreaking as it was in terms of offering a new commercial option for online buyers (effectively leading to what is the modern niche market) much of its aura doesn't seem to be related to the scent. Focusing solely on the fragrance, it's good, clearly it's good, and interesting, and a nice, dry, dusty spiced amber. I enjoyed sampling it but I didn't find it to be a top tier amber or oriental on my skin: if anything, I preferred it in the air, and perhaps would prefer it as an aroma to scent a room. Ultimately, the Au Coeur flanker is LADDM, but better, and improves one of the major failings of this fragrance - performance. I still think this is a good scent, though, and deserving of 8/10. Just not quite top tier.
*original review posted May 31 2019* I have been wearing this fragrance for the second time for around 5 hours and it's still going strong. I has to be the strongest EdT I have ever experienced.
The opening as well the first hour and a half are exactly what the name of this fragrance implies. It is dusty, dry, spicy and ambery. Dare I say it remotely reminded me of Roja Parfum's Enigma in the beginning. They are different but initially it had a slightly bubbly cola vibe on me. That did eventually go away after 10-30minutes and there were no similarities afterwards.
This particular fragrance has a mysterious and adventurous vibe to it, where you really can picture standing in a veranda overlooking a desert and a spice market nearby. You hear people bartering far away and the warm wind blows in your face as the sun sets. You get whiffs of the spice market as well as the arid, dry air of the desert. This is in the first hour and a half or so.
In the dry down, it is a bit disappointing in my opinion. The amber is very dominant in the base of this fragrance and it does feel quite old fashioned. It reminds me of a 80s amber fragrance with not much else going on. It's not distasteful or off-putting in anyway. It just loses the uniqueness that was present in the opening. It's just not as interesting. Dare I say it just feels a bit old lady-ish. It may be just on my skin.
Both projection and longevity are solid. Most amber fragrances are I find.
There are reviews around saying that it's not versatile and it's hard to find occasions to wear it. I don't understand where they're coming from with this. This fragrance is quite versatile as long as you don't wear it in summer. 3 season wearability is versatile to me. Furthermore, it can be worn both in special occasions as well as just casually. Lastly, I'd say it's perfectly unisex. Thus, it IS a versatile fragrance. 
I would definitely recommend as this fragrance is rare in that it does transport you to another place and another time. I would definitely try before buying though. It's not exactly mass-appealing. I really REALLY wanted to like this (partially due to its cult status) but I just simply do not under the hype! 
It's a very dusty, 80s rose....urm okay?
Either I'm smelling something totally different to everyone else, or this is just a sad case of Emperor's New Clothes....
Kinda smells like my late grandma's old closet in her garage. Finally ordered a sample and I’m very pleasantly surprised! I don’t find it daring at all. On the contrary, I find it mesmerising and very beautiful.
I get lots of amber, some spice, some very slight animalic’s in the opening (but not harsh or skanky as I tend to hate these kind of animalic notes myself), and some woods. On my skin it dries down to a very creamy amber, and I definitely detect some ambergris. I get the same fizzy / dusty feeling when ambergris and sandalwood mix, which reminds me of the dry down in Bois Du Portugal (which happens to be my current favourite fragrance).
This is a love from me and I think I will need to pick up a bottle. The only downside is I’m not sure when I would wear it. I have asked 3 people to smell it on me and none of them like it. Its therefore not one I would wear to work, in a casual setting, or on a date with my wife. I may just have to buy it for myself to enjoy when I’m relaxing with a drink and thinking of Arabia!
Smell - 9/10
Longevity - 8/10 about 6-7 hours (out of a tiny 1ml sample atomiser)
Versatility - 3/10 (but it smells so good that I don’t care!) I don't get the hype. Andy Tauer 02 smells like a 80's Amber fragrance. As I´ve been to Morocco I can´t imagine anything that smells of Tauer 02 besides ppl with 80's perfume. The sweet vanilly amber is pillowed by classical woody notes like vetiver and cedar. It´s not a bad perfume, but nothing groundbreaking. It's powdery. If I want all these aspects, I use a much cheaper Bijan pour homme. I wonder why they didn't list the cannabis note on it.
If you sniff around the metallic atomizer you will feel it!
""L'air du californian cities"" - That's a smell that I just smelled in Los Angeles.
Taking that apart, It smells amazing on skin but even better in the air.
Not a beast mode at all means. Last around 6 hours.
Funny thing is that the projection is good for about 3 hours but when it become a skin scent it kinda disappear quite fast.
It is a super distinct smell. Quite rare to find something similar in the market.
It would be a staple on my wardrobe if it last a bit longer on my skin (at least 8 hours)
Ah, just an observation! It has the worst atomizer and sealing system that I have ever seen. Just horrible! Overhyped. Smells like non-descipt 80s cologne at first. Something a man 50+ should wear. Not off putting. Pleasant. High quality. Just not super unique or identifiable. High quality but not signature scent worthy. An absolute beast, but in a lovely way.
Amazing scent which lasts and projects all day. Faultless on both aspects.
I've never had this one tagged as unisex though, it's very masculine for my point of view. Some lighter notes but overall it's a man's scent.
Spices, patchouli, amber and wood notes with some soft floral notes behind them just blend so magically together.
An absolute masterpiece.
Any downsides? Only one. The price. I'm not saying it's overpriced, but it will stop lots of people being able to afford it. And that's a shame, cos it's just a brilliant fragrance. And everyone deserves to try this at least. 
Masterpiece. This grew on me a lot during the day, with a lovely warm amber/labdanum thing going on, but I am not a huge fan of cloves and there really seemed to me a strong cloves note running all the way through this.
I am on the other hand a huge fan of just about all the other listed notes in this, especially coriander and cumin (I wore my sample of it knowing I'd be at lunch in an Indian restaurant that day) which is why it's frustrating that I didn't pick up on the coriander and cumin but only the cloves.
Maybe I'm just a bit sensitive to that note.
I respect this fragrance a lot for what it has managed to do, but I won't be buying it. This is an absolute beast mode.
I sprayed just once, then had a shower, smells the same, washed hands multiple times throughout the day. Not any weaker. Went to bed and smell it. The lasting power is unreal.
The opening is absolutely beautiful and I would wear it myself, but then it changes into masculine leaning fragrance.
It reminds me of I Coloniali fragrances, which I love. I tried to add some vanilla to make it more feminine and it turned into something like Casmir Chopard. 
I think this would be very sexy on a man, but for the right occasion and applied in moderation.
When I say in moderation, I mean do it like French women. Spray it once in the air and walk through it. More and it's dangerous territory. ""As the sands of the desert are to the weary traveler, so are words to he who loveth silence.""
Moroccan proverb
Character in a movie
Peter O'Toole as Lawrence in Lawrence of Arabia(1962)
Mr. Dryden:
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature get fun in the desert: Bedouins and gods, and you're neither. Take it from me, for ordinary men, it's a burning, fiery furnace.
T.E. Lawrence:
No, Dryden, it's going to be fun.
Mr. Dryden:
It is recognized that you have a funny sense of fun. 2020 bought a sample from luckyscent. Poured 0,5 ml on my hand. Low to medium projection first 30min then it becomes skin scent for 2 more hours. 
I was ready to buy a bottle but this one was a big disappointment for me. Definitely reformulated or watered down.
Wife commented that I smell like dead man :) no thank you How beautiful is this fragrance? This is absolutely gorgeous and truly transportive. The amber is the star here, it’s intense, syrupy and dense. There is an array of a spice cloud in the background that immerses the sweet amber, but it never overpowers. Finally, there is a raw floral sweetness in the background. 
In the dry down, there is a cooling freshness from the essential oils of the herbs. 
Very unisex and wearable, perfect for a summer evening. 
This captures everything you would want to experience in a Saharan desert- escapism, cultural wealth and an unapologetic authenticity. One thing I love about this fragrance is how all the notes are blended to perfection, so that none of them clash and emerge individually. They all combine into a beautiful blend. I love how the fragrance embodies the intense heat as it is very warm in character and holds a lot of depth. 
This is what we are looking for, creative expression and transportive masterpieces.
Excellent performance. Starts with a dusty dense spicy ambery-incensy like chemicals and as the time goes by the fragrance starts to calm down the desert storm and it opens up to a creamy warm and slightly sweet but still confortable arabian spices bazaar nuances. There is a big difference between the opening and the dry down, the first 1-2 hours are very dense, dark and stormy. 
I am not sure if this was big mistake or a big creation that eventually forced the title of the fragrance but surely it is a pleasant olfactory experience. I realize that in the last 2-3 years I haven’t used this fragrances and I believe that one of the reasons might be the nose behind it, let’s not forget that Mr. Tauer has a degree in chemistry and before becoming a “nose” he was a chemist. I wander if any of his creations will ever have one natural ingredient besides water but for this reason his prices remained affordable. 
Anyway the fragrance is nice and worth trying but don’t buy before sampling. Wow, people are not kidding. This fragrance is a true masterpiece. Spicy and warm but so wearable! I wish I could wear it but it's a bit masculine and just smells amazing on my boyfriend.
So sexy! My obsession with Tauer started with Noontide Petals a couple of years ago. I am so heartbroken now as I have just learned that Tauer strictly refuses to sell his perfumes to Turkey, have no idea why. Anyways, I have just received my 15 ml decant of LDDM, applied a tiny drop at the top of my hand, short of words - totally SHOCKED and PARALYZED by the beauty of it. That is all I gotta say. After finishing my decant, I will be stocking full bottles (at least 3/4 bottles) whenever I get a chance. 
Edit: IF HEAVEN HAD A SMELL, THAT WOULD BE IT !
10/10. Not enough ! Let me say 11/10 Wearing this perfume is a special experience. If you need a simple, crowd-pleasing fragrance, better stay away! For L'air du Desert Marocain is a niche fragrance with a capital N, aimed at experienced perfumistas and true connoisseurs; it's not meant to be liked by everybody and their mama.
The opening is quite animalic (read: stinky) - you'll be shocked by the smell of dirty socks and manure! Upon closer inspection (yes I'm brave), it's the combination of strong cumin in copious amounts, indolic jasmine, coriander and my enemy petitgrain that produces such an off-putting effect. But, please, don't run off just yet! Wait for another 10-15 minutes until the scent settles on your skin, and you'll be rewarded with something beautiful and mysterious. On the one hand, there's vetiver, cedar and a hint of patchouli, and on the other, sweet amber/labdanum. After another half an hour, L'air du Desert Marocain starts to resemble MFK Grand Soir, only less sweet, which leads me to conclude that labdanum eventually emerges as the strongest note. Moreover I swear there must be some ambergris in the 'Marocain' as well, because I can catch wafts of MFK's another bestseller, Baccarat Rouge, with its unmistakable combination of sweet resins and salty ambergris. 
I would say that L'air du Desert Marocain is unisex, leaning masculine; however, as a mature alpha woman, I've found it to be perfectly wearable. Silage is moderate, but longevity is superb - 10+ hours. Complex
Strong
masterpiece!!! Simply gorgeous. This is a fragrance that is unabashed, it is strong, aromatic and not afraid to display its beauty. I did not appreciate this enough initially, but the more I test it the more impressed I am. Amber and woods with spice in an intoxicating combination. Due to its potency, I would reserve for occasional wear. Definitely lives up to the hype in my opinion. to my nose it starts out aromatic with lavender, something in the mint/basil/shiso family, then I get leathery chypre notes, inky vanilla ambergris, a savory orange,slightly sour - maybe birch or moss, quickly followed by cumin & sage
it comes across a little smoky & animalic like unwashed skin
I also smell another ingredient like anise or licorice adding another layer of sweetness 
NOW having actually looked at the notes - obviously yes on the amber - it's more of the inky style of ambergris & it really is the backbone of this perfume, yes coriander, cedar, BIG TIME CUMIN, yes on the oakmoss & birch which I already suspected, yes to the jasmine - when mixed with the cumin & oakmoss gives it a stinky unwashed skin smell, this part makes me think of Salome by Papillon Artisan, yes to the petitgrain in the beginning & I think the geranium is supplying the mintiness 
overall very interesting blend, I like it but it takes some getting used to, not an instant love but grows on you as you wear it 
3 sprays medium to strong projection & lasts a long time I'm speechless. This is the most otherworldy and sexy fragrance I have smelled so far in life. I'm obsessed.
This is the scent of a breeze on Tatooine.
It's nearly impossible to describe and it's a masterpiece. This was one of 18 samples I got from Lucky Scent and this is the only one I knew I had to have a full bottle of immediately. 
Swooningly sexy and unisexy. ;) it's from another world, from another galaxy, it's simply unique, I can't explain it, you have to smell it. Pungent, ambery-spicy-woody, warm fall/winter scent! That's what I get out of it! It does not smell too close to Chergui but has the same vibe to it and therefore will be used in the same circumstances. First 10-15 min from the initial spray will probably scare off half of potential buyers (it opens very loud, dated and cloying). However, just when I was close to giving up on this, the mid and dry-down were actually very smooth and rich, modern and sexy. Beast mode projection and longevity (less is more here - I use 2 sprays). Very interesting creation, once again, in the same group with Chergui but different enough for you to want to test it! What more can you say about this wonderful creation? I wore it today for the first time an a while and once again love its honeyed depth and long-lasting sweetness. Expensive of course! Andy Tauer's L'Air du Desert Marocain is a successful scent, I think. It deftly pairs the traditional amber accord (labdanum + vanilla and so on) with linalool-rich coriander and creamy atlas cedar. It's not wildly creative, nor is it especially daring, unique or noteworthy; even the name is slightly derivative. But the fragrance smells wonderful, has a mid-level sillage and tenacity, and delivers on the notes promised, for the most part.
For the price, it's a good deal if you like cistus/amber fragrances. Some people find too much labdanum/cistus turns their stomach and prefer more sweet or vanilla-rich ambers--this one isn't for you. This is a well-realised, cistus-heavy amber that is at times intoxicating and slightly addictive.
If you like the cistus and want to explore similar scents, I'd recommend Chantecaille's Kalimantan, a classic oriental amber inspired by Borneo. You can find my review on Kalimantan's Fragrantica page. Ridiculous to label this as a designer.
I was last Summer in Switzerland and Andy Tauer was nowhere available. So if this ain't niche, than nothing is. It's complex and pleasingly changeable, smells rich , sweet and expensive, slightly nauseating too but..... there is something quite old fashioned about this smell. I imagine an aging beauty wearing this, bejeweled, drowning in endangered furs and whale fat. 
It's hard not to like it for pure nostalgia's sake and perhaps in the right setting , on the right person, heads will turn, for a moment. 
Personally , I can't help thinking that smells of this kind evolved to relieve the senses of the ungodly smells emanating from the royal courts of europe. But just like the masterpieces adorning their walls, you need a chateau and the 17th century to make a home for it. Let me start by saying that this fragrance is one of a kind. It has a severely hostile opening followed by a dry and dusty drydown, which ,as the hours pass, tends to become more approachable, softer and smoother. This is not a friendly scent, most likely it is not going to gather you compliments and is somewhat unwearable. However it is a beautiful creation, so different, so artistic. This fragrance has depth and deserves to be explored.
8/10 I wanted to check out the whole Tauer line so spent an hour or so in Les S in Victoria. James is a great guy, as are all the staff, and he knows, or should that be Nose, his stuff. If you've never been to the store I highly recommend it.
Anyhoo, having previously had a 5ml sample of LDDM I was instantly drawn to try it first. Popped the cap, sniffed the sprayer, hit the trigger and soaked the test strip.....AMAZEBALLS, blown away by it. Has a frag ever been so aptly named? Was tempted to stop my sampling there and just buy it. However, common sense won the day and I went through the whole line up and I'd say every one of Andy's creations is a hit in my book, except Tuberose, but that's for another review.
Back to LDDM, having been mesmerised by it 30 mins earlier I decided to test it and Lonestar Memories on skin. 2 sprays of each, one on each hand, off to a cafe, munch some food, slurp a coffee, did a few emails etc etc and then back to Les S to make my purchase.
James asked what one I was going for and I said......Lonestar Memories, and it wasn't even a tough decision. I never thought I'd say this but you've got to tell it how it is, and on my skin LDDM is flat, dull, lifeless and totally devoid of character. I asked James' opinion and he concurred that everything that makes LDDM so compelling just simply wasn't there on me. The rich concert of spices and resins coupled with the depth it has were morphed in to a what at best I'd say was a 'Coriander-esque slightly woody skin scent'. BUT don't let that put you off as I'd still recommend this as a fantastic frag and defo worth at least sampling. 
As for me I'm now very much in the camp of Andy T admireres and I guess I'm a bit of a Tauer fanboy!! I wore this wonderful parfum today. I get a very dry, desert smell. I cannot describe the smell, but its a high quality scent. I was able to detect it even after 9 hours. However, I like a beastly smelling scent and that's what I want if I'm going to spend $125 dollars on a parfum. This parfum deserves a very Honorable mention however... Now, the bottle that this review is for is LDDM 2017. 
UPDATE: I ordered a 2019 bottle. Not much difference. I can't even tell. It's definitely still a winner. Nice pettigrain, coriander, resins. Very dry. It definitely reminds me of a desert. 9 hrs longevity so far, moderate but respectable sillage. Way to go Andy!!! Tell IFRA t o go screw themselves!!! 
P.S. I got a nice bar of scented soap from Andy and a nice thank you card with my 2019 bottle. Who bothers to do that anymore??? Nobody I know of except Andy Tauer and Olympic Orchids, Ms. Covey. Anyway, it was a nice touch!!! Respect for a composition that pleases many, but man, this is unwearable. Unremittingly sharp, acrid, burning; there's an animalic rancidity here that reminds me of Salvador Dalí pour homme, which also makes it feel a bit dated. The amber is cloying. This is a cigar-chomping alpha-male swashbuckler for sure. This perfume might work on The Terminator. I imagine this scent, its dry singular bouquet of notes, being the result of Mr. Tauer taking his concoction to the rooftop of a building in Fez and letting the sun scorch it down into a sticky singular resinous essence. If you've never smelt a fragrance quote on quote, ""dry"" you'll likely understand after wearing this. Perfectly halfway between French classy floral vanilla and Middle Eastern ambery woods. The blend has a feeling of *expansion*, and like all great scents, is more than the sum of its parts, a new ""thing"" has been made. Lasts flippin' ages, projects well, especially in warm weather, doesn't fade, doesn't fall apart. But all this is secondary to the ""LOVELY"" which I feel on smelling it. Compliments from everyone, and a feeling of being (the scent equivalent of) well-dressed. It doesn't get better than this; different yes, but better? No. Fabulous x There is no lavender, birch, geranium, patchouli, moss or amber listed on Tauer's website. And as a previous reviewer noticed, it's pretty funny to see how the brain can be influenced, and how some may smell ""rose"" by not knowing that ""rock rose"" is a synonym of labdanum (that is: a resin extracted from the cistus flower, that smells green-ish, but not even remotely of rose). Also funny to read that some feel the ""warmth of the amber"", while there is no vanilla in this one, nor in the pyramid, nor do I smell any (amber= resin+vanilla, while ambergris= animalic/salty tincture, made form sperm whale feces).
What I get:
This opens with a strong petitgrain note, supported by spices.
Then a strong green labdanum note shows up, supported by subtle florals.
The ending is spectacular with a dusty cedar note supported by vetiver that nearly reminds me of tobacco and booze. Can't spot the ambergris.
The effect of sand/dust made by the spice is impressively real.
As for performance, I confirm the statements of a couple of previous reviewers: it starts subtle, but after an hour or so, the projection becomes average/good. The longevity is stellar, as I can still distinctively smell it as a skin scent after 24+ hours. I will not reinvent the wheel in saying that it's a spectacular spicy resinous frag, one of the few that I thought deserves its price. It's a work of art and the hype is real. 
I cannot do otherwise than loving it given how cleary noticeable each single note is and how creative and unique this one is. Just keep in mind that this is a ""cuddle at home during a cold day"" type of fragrance, to enjoy while drinking a tea (best if Moroccan).
Best on Fall/Winter days, unisex, 30+ Dry and nice and great for parties 
I don’t know how to describe it i can tell you in just one word which i come up with is masterpiece and perfect fragrance which you can get
100 out of 100 A legendary masterpiece 
Scent : 10/10
Longevity : 9/10
Sillage : 8/10
Quality : 9/10
Bottle and Box : 10/10 Apparently a lot of the reviewers here think that ""rock rose"" is a variety of the rose flower, it isn't. There is no ""rose"" in this perfume whatsoever. ""Rock rose"" is another name for the plant Cistus ladanifer. It is where Labdanum resin comes from, which is what is in LDDM. Labdanum and rose do not smell anything alike, so all the reviews about there being a rose note in LDDM are simply wrong, and misleading. After watching a bunch of YouTube reviews on this fragrance and hearing the word masterpiece thrown about and it alot of top 10 videos, I decided i had to try this out.
Omg this is such a disappointment and i was so let down by this fragrance i am now starting to think these fragrances reviewers are just straight up lying.
The fragrance is nothing special infact its not even particularly pleasing. Started off with a overpowering vanilla scent and then goes to smokey but again too much and just kind of kills the fragrance.
I am utterly disappointed in this fragrance and these youtubers who are scared to give a bad review. So many reviews... I've had this for a while now, maybe a year. It's potent stuff, very, very strong. Love the opening and the heart (please read other reviews), but in the drydown it becomes cloying, and I can't shake this feeling that lasts for hours and hours. Don't spray above elbows, keep your nose away. If you don't do heavy, sweet bases, say like vanilla, stay away from this. I'd always recommend Au Coeur du Desert before LADDM, it's a better blend overall, while maintaining the same general vibe and quality. It lasts forever. My score: 7/10 This is definitely going to join my collection. I cannot confirm the longevity yet, but the scent itself is excellent. It's very unique and intense at the start. It dries down sweetly into a dry spicy leather. It's very herbal and earthy. Glad I got to sample it. In the end not a perfume that makes my heart leap. Unisex. Similar in vibe to La Fumee Miller Harris. - who is dominic talking to? People can leave curious non reviews. This is a pretty intelligent oriental-ish scent with excellent performance both in sillage and duration. Its not radical but its also in no way ordinary or boring. It is not exactly a pure oriental as the name implies. Its got more of a back room in an export shop...anywhere.....london to Cairo to Jakarta. And it is this that i like. On me it works. I don't see this working as well for women. Feels pretty masculine. Just one word: Masterpiece. Here the summer start 
And i spray it last night exactly 3 spray
It’s so nice and wonderful and still with me 
Even if in summer like 38 centigrade i can wear it
This is not a perfume actually this is truly art I really really like this! It's not terribly loud or bold, yet it's more than a skin scent. It's kind of rugged, western-ey and delicious. This is what I'd smell walking into a log cabin in the woods, and there's a luscious, weathered, worn leather jacket hanging off a post, and everything just... smells... right. Honestly, I never understood the cult status of this fragrance. It's a soft comfortable rose, but it's really not that impressive? For years everybody always raved to me about it and when I actually got the chance to smell it...well I think, to put it mildly, I was disappointed. I really imagined this to be some kind of revolutionary take on rose but honest to god, this is the most grandma-style rose I've ever smelled. Makes me think of a dusty closet that has not been opened in decades. Can we all just stop pretending that AT has done something revolutionary and accept that it's just a pleasant easy rosy smell and stop worshipping it like its the best thing since sliced bread...? Some time ago I wrote a review where I said I loved smelling it on others, but could not imagine wearing it myself. Changed my mind. Think I might bathe in it! This was a blind buy for me and to be honest I have a mixed feeling about it which goes back to rather synthetic scent I get from it.
It'e well blended and overall great but if I had the chance I would go for Amouage Epic man which has the similar theme but far more natural than what this offers.
quality and longevity wise there is no doubt about .try it before buying for sure. Did a review get downvoted because they thought they didnt understand the naming of the frag? To start, Andy didn't just evoke the desert only because it is a dry amber. 
Quoting loosely, he recalls being in Morocco looking out the window of his hotel during the amber glow of the sunset. The dry desert breeze hits him with pastries and bread from traditional bakeries, sweet hookah smoke, spices being sold among other goodies in the souks nearby. 
It smells so good I have to believe it. Makes me want to go to Morocco even more. Will always be a 10/10 love for me. No praise I can say has not already been said. 
Just want to contribute that the amber accord has a vanilla so masterfully blended that you cant even tell it's prominent. No one including myself calls this a vanilla frag but look for it and youre in for a shock. Mysterious, dark and exotic. Great performance. Will make a statement and get you noticed. 10/10 A very light, Arabic spicy rosey ambery scent.
A stereotypically Middle Eastern scent but light & inoffensive, almost airy, as if it was a light spicy scent smelled in a cool breeze, & as opposed to the usual heavy Arabic creations.
While it is a very likable fragrance, I believe LADDM is hyped up because it is one of the first to introduce Arabic scents to European & North American countries.
As an Arab, this is a very familiar & a not very distinctive smell & I feel as I've smelled this scent (or something like it) a lot before but that doesn't take away from the fact that LADDM is in fact a beautiful smell.
Also, this fragrance, as good as it is, is overhyped.
Overall, a lovely smell & a great introducer to Arabic smells. Safe for blind buying. @gerry.madoni 
I don't often challenge nonsensical reviews, but I had to pick yours apart - not least because it directly contradicts your other positive reviews (and belies your own taste). 
I am surprised you thought that LADDM would - or should - smell like North African desert air. Would you expect Bleu de Chanel to smell blue? What about Eau Sauvage? Do you think that smells of ""wild water""? 
Your favourite fragrance is Roja Dove's Kingdom of Bahrain and you've written a glowing review of that; does that smell of Bahrain? What about another of your favourites, Clive Christian's Chasing the Dragon Hypnotic? How does that smell? Of fire, cinders and smoke? What does ""hypnotic"" smell like? Or dragons? You know they're mythical, of course - so how do they smell? (I'll save anyone else checking the Clive Christian notes: they're clove, cinnamon, and cherry.)
Although you personally aren't enamoured of LADDM, it doesn't mean that people's glowing reviews are inspired by hype and aren't their genuine opinion. Just saying. I really couldn't get my head around this scent when I first sampled it. It was as though I couldn't quite tell if it was similar to something I'd smelled before, and if not, what was different about it. Andy Tauer must have worked some kind of (al)chemical magic when he formulated L'Air du Desert Marocain, because it is truly a shape-shifter. With killer performance, this fragrance morphs depending on your body chemistry and ambient environment. For me, it smells much more floral and green in hot, humid weather; the cold, on the other hand, tends to bring out the spices, woods, and musks. Almost none of the notes are distinguishable from one another, usually the mark of an expertly blended fragrance. The result is more of an olfactory experience than a fragrant artifact to be studied and dissected. Dry, yes, and spicy too. But also soft and floral. The hint of a vintage vibe, but altogether postmodern in its composition. Not everybody is going to like this, and I can definitely see how it could be off-putting to some. L'AdDM is not a timid fragrance, and doesn't apologize for its eccentricities, but instead wears them proudly on its sleeve and invites you to share in their delights. Genderless, and could work for anybody over 20. The bottle certainly stands out in my collection, and Andy's personal touch and amazing customer service are pretty unique in the fragrance world. Thank you for this bold, deeply idiosyncratic creation! Gerry Madoni
Indeed, the desert has no scent. On the great outdoors the only scents that air carries are those from the trees, flowers, moss. All those things you won't find in a desert.
The desert is called desert because it's deserted. 
Sand and sandstone unless you dive your head in it, won't give you much scent.
It is the atmosphere. The imagination of humans.
Though I believe if I would wake up with my face looking up at the sky, in Zion, Arches, Bryce NP etc, I would know in a matter of seconds I would be somewhere in Utah or Arizona. 
Not because of a scent but because of the air and the climate.
Just a thought. Just my imagination.
On the fragrance: I also have a lot of negative experiences with overly hyped fragrances. So I try to take it all with a pinch of salt. I want a sample of this before jumping on the bandwagon. I have a new puppy and I am fricking knackered. I've just got into bed, having showered, and really just wanted to go to sleep - but I couldn't, because I felt naked without perfume (anyone else get this?). 
I lay in bed for 5 minutes or so, being pestered by one of my cats who is (understandably) feeling particularly unsettled and - let's be frank, here - pissed off by the canine interloper, wondering what on earth would settle my jangled nerves (three ageing cats and an energetic German Shepherd pup do not make for a calm household, despite the pup being born into a home with 5 cats who are completely inured to the 5 dogs already there). My cats view the pup as... I dunno... an alien? They may well have been chased by neighbours' dogs, and Monty's introduction has not gone down well. 
The only perfume I could think of was L'Air du Desert Marocain. To put this into perspective, I own nearly 850 bottles of perfume and at least as many decants/samples. I have no idea why LADDM soothes me, but it does. It's austere, dry, complex and... well, simply, quite wonderful. It screams quality and Andy Tauer's love, care, and attention to detail just pours out of the bottle, onto skin and into my soul. I'd apologise for the hyperbole, but I'm too tired to excuse or justify it. 
It's simultaneously unlike anything I've smelled (although I detect the bones of Le Maroc Pour Elle in here), but familiar; it's classic, modern, and completely unisex. 
You owe it to yourself to get your nose on this. It will make your soul sing. Think... Coco Chanel or Ambre Sultan by Serge Lutens, maybe even combined or maybe Ambre Sultan first with it's oriental approach and the dry down is Coco Chanel. A grown up smell. An expensive smell. I think it's more suitable for ages 25 and up. I think it's quite wearable, just like how Coco Chanel is wearable, but if you know the smell of Coco you will understand why people are saying it's a little hard to pull off in any occasion. This scent would be ideal in the fall and winter months. A rare find indeed.
This can be worn in any season, at any time of day and for any reason.
Just perfect. This is love from 1 look at the bottle itself and 1 breath, which won me over once and for all. Let me explain why. I was not in the desert, and I do not know how the desert air smells, and therefore I will not speak on this subject. I want to say about 2 notes that are not in the pyramid, but personally I feel. one . it is a delicate lime scent, when grandma whitened the walls, that's exactly what smelled, I adore this smell - the smell of lime and calcium, it is this note that I always smell in the aroma. 2 note-delicate aroma of incense + with dry wood, in combination with lime, this is just a magnificent alliance. It was he who brought me back to my childhood to beloved people who are no longer there: (and at the same time opened a new veil of perfumery revelation of the Master. Aroma for brutal and women who like extraordinary men :-) .
As for some comments about sweets. It all depends on what kind of skin you have. I have an ice and this flavor, for me just a delight. My husband is hot, and that's what a sweet amber appears on her. It is on the hot male skin, the fragrance has lost its charm and the scent on it has revealed more feminine and sweet! if not for the nuances of body temperature. In my opinion it is a SMELL. Firmness of aroma, as well as a train at height. My passion for niche perfume began with this fragrance. In those years, at the start of my perfumery journey, I like,probably, many others, watched perfume reviews on YouTube. And very often, in all sorts of tops, was featured L Air Du Desert Marocain. Before tried it, I watched all video-reviews on Youtube and read all the reviews on Russian and English-language websites and forums. I was very interested in the fragrance, so I ordered a decant. 
In those times, I was very skeptical about the names of the fragrances and the ""legends"" accompanying them. Never before, any fragrance created images puted in the name, and did not transfer to any place, whose name it was called. But L air Du Desert Marocain managed to do it.
I sprayed it and immediately transported from cool evening in the Moscow to a desert, with hot sand under the scorching sun and dry air, burning the lungs, with every breath. The hot wind carried many aromas teasing nose. There, caravan make a camp and from the heated, for a day’s journey, leather, saddle bags comes smell of dried flowers, herbs, spices and dried fruits; and from where the nomads set up tents, the wind brings aroma of handmade, wooden figurines and smoke from burning incense.
Andy is a real magician, he made not just a fragrance, he created images and feelings in a bottle, a real aromatherapy. L Air Du Desert Marocain is an excellent example of the niche fragrance and I think, everyone, who loves perfumes, should try it! I find particularly patchouli and amber It reminds me of Indian incense sticks, that’s not bad to me... it is persistent. I like this scent and i don’t find it so heavy like some reviewers wrote, but certainly you feel it a lot on you. In my opinion it is a little too simple, basically patchouli scent. I absolutely love this. It's one of those fragrances that you will keep wanting to take close sniffs of all day. People around you might disagree though. My wife yelled at me in disgust when I wore it and a co-worker thought I smelled like wet paint. This is all after only one spray. If you work in a confined space I wouldn't recommend... maybe save it for the weekend. L’air du désert Marocain by Andy Tauer. Amber, coriander, cumin, birch, patchouli and lavender are the main players in this composition. This was 3 years ago one the best definition of an oriental, not anymore to me. This formulation I bought last year was very deceiving since I smell more alcohol in the opening and the performances went obviously down. I heard that “Au cœur du desert” was a stronger version of LDDM. That explains everything. Will I keep it in my collection? Nope! I will not keep any fragrance if the quality is not maintained at the same level of the one I felt in love with and I recommend anyone to do so. As a fraghead I think we should send a clear message to the perfume industry to make them understand that we will not buy anymore these diluted juices even if they are hyped to death by some reviewers. Peace to everyone! I just got a bottle I bought online and it came with an autographed “Thank you” from Andy Tauer himself. Is that normal?
This is a dry, spicy incense fragrance, not as much Vetiver and petite grain as the votes suggest, which I am glad about, but there is more patchouli and labdanum. That’s okay with me too. All and all, I love the fragrance but I think I would have been happier with Lonestar Memories, living in Texas and loving anything with leather. L’air du désert Marocain has no leather in it as others have suggested. My favorite part of this scent is the awesome coriander note. Different, that's for sure. On me this smells like a pile of old, used burlap sacks that have been lying in some forgotten corner since before my mother was born. Dry, dusty, even a bit musty. This isn't what I'd hoped for, but there's a subtle spiciness and a sense of desert heat that's really intriguing. As others have cautioned, this one isn't a “blind buy” fragrance, but I definitely think everyone ought to give it a try. This is a very nice incense scent, one of the more bearable ones, its not too strong and light, there is a sweetness which I take comes from the rock rose and jasmine, I wouldn't say its a masterpiece as I consider frags to be masterpieces when you can differenciate every single note and combines so well, wereas with this one, I cant make out some of the notes! overall if you like smokey and spicey scents, this is one of the best. 7.5/10 I see other reviews saying this one is a little hard to pull off, or to find a proper time to wear. I find this absolute olfactory gold! I can't really find the words to accurately describe the scent, but I suppose a desert evening air describes the overall ""feeling'' this one invokes. I get mostly coriander, cedar and amber off the top which sounds odd to makeup desert air smell. My new favourite fragrance of all time. It is true that its not versatile in the sense you might not want this as a date night scent, everyday wear, or casual exclusively. I will wear this just to satisfy myself any time without concern who might like/dislike it. I would recommend any fragrance enthusiast to try this one at least once. Cant wait to try others from Tauer Very nice composition following the trend of oriental and ouhdy fragrances. Ordered a sample I've been wearing for a week and can't see what the hype is over this scent! It's a good perfume that opens up with cumin and citrus, not much neroli to my nose, screeching top notes that aren't of my taste. Cistus and jasmine hit next, and that's when I detect an incensy note I can't put my finger on... It stays quite linear, getting thinner and not developing into the rich, sticky, smokey aura its name suggests. It just don't deliver. I'll wear it with pleasure, but there are orientals such as Shalimar, Opium or even Obsession that performs better and are far more complex for maybe s fraction of its price. What can I say that hasn't been said? An absolute masterpiece that brings meaning to why we love this hobby so much. Reviewing after Wearing almost 1 year :
This is really a art niche perfume 
I love it so much
Everytime i wear i feel good and special and found something new in it
Really its a masterpiece i call it magical fragrance 
About longevity i can tell you about more than 36 hours obviously you can feel it 
With 3 spray
And sillage i can tell you its a beast woth just 3 spray every time i got compliments and asking the name of my perfume:))
Love it so much 
My mark is 101 out of 100 
Thumbs up This is my cup of sandy tea! 
I became so immensely happy when I found this! My immediate reaction was that I´v found my holy grail and that it smelled ""me"" like no other perfume I´v encountered.
On me, the final dry down becomes a bit to vanillary and sweet, but its still one of my absolute favorites. 
 There is just the right kind of smokey incense with coriander and sand. Its warm and I find it comfortable. Like my favorite worn in, but still really good looking, clothing.
And I truly love the opening of dry, warm sand! 
On me it blooms in summer heat.
L´Air du Desert Marocain and Au Coeur Désert are really similar to me. They have different openings (I prefer L´Airs aggressively sandy dryness). 
There´s not a big difference in the dry down on my skin, but Coeur doesn´t have the same vanillary final stage and lasts longer, so if I had to choose, I would go for Coeur. But I love both of them! What first comes to mind is being at a medina in Marrakesh surrounded by stalls and vendors selling a vast array of spices and wooden trinkets. It is midday and the sun is beating down. Warm gusts of wind pass through the medina levitating dust from the ground and mixing it with the smoky, comforting aroma of pipe tobacco drawn and exhaled by wandering old men. A few yards away from the spice stall is a cookie vendor; the essence of vanilla drifts over the various spices displayed upon sun-baked wood. A luxury 3rd world. I sprayed it once on my neck and I was asked: ""A little overboard on the cologne today?""
This stuff was almost a scrubber for me after my co-worker asking me that, but I wore it unapologetically. It's a beast, and I can see why so many can like this, but it is not my cup of tea. This is one of those fragrances which is ever evolving on the skin and the kind I wear purely for my own pleasure. Starts off dry and dusty with quite a lot of spices, changing over time to leave this real sweetness. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's gourmand but it's like having a Moroccan meal, starting with savoury and spicy dishes before finishing with a sweet pastry dessert. I wish I smelled what everyone else is describing! On me, this is ambergris and more ambergris. Which I like, but it's certainly not a night in Marrakesh! Happy I bought my sample, but for me there's no need to go out and spend tons of money on a full bottle. I'll probably use up my 2 ml in the hopes that someone else will be as captivated as I'm not.
Update: Surprise surprise! I put this on at 9:00 this morning. It's 4:30, and it's settled down into a spicy, woody fragrance that is a lot more complex than the linear ambergris that I've been getting all day. Still no florals at all, to my nose or maybe it's just my skin, but I like it better than I did earlier. Still not going to buy it, though.
Another update: Today I used up the last of my sample. Lo and behold, I love it! I got a blast of ambergris in the initial spray, but it evolved quickly into smoky, spicy, amber-y, woody perfection. Now, more than 9 hours after I applied it, I've been waiting for the sweet, creamy, vanilla-like notes to appear, and it never had even a touch of anything floral as far as my nose is concerned, but that's okay. I'm still sniffing my wrist and enjoying the desert wind evoked there. It's funny how the opening of salty, oceanic, animalic ambergris morphs into North African incense floating through sandy tents in a bazaar. Cool trick, Andy Tauer! But dammit, now I have to go buy a bottle! This is not your average crowd pleasing fragrance. It actually leans more to challenging side rather than to wearable side. That is maybe a reason why it has never been cloned. And thanks to that, it stays super unique to this day. 
I was in the past in Morocco. I walked the streets of Marrakesh and Fez. I climbed Jebel Toubkal and ventured through the desert of Sahara on the back of camel. I remember climbing dune in the middle of the night while the sand was still warm. Sky was full of stars. I wish I could wear This masterpiece in that very moment.
That is actually what this fragrance is about. It is about a moment, atmosphere and feeling.
Well done Andy.
This is a piece of art. 
Scent: 10/10
Performance: 8/10
Versatility: 6/10 There is something real, grounded, and established in this scent that is like a classic tome that has become part of your memory even if you have never read it. Yet at the same time it is truly mysterious and just out of reach. There is a warm and friendly undertone flowing beneath what might otherwise be a dry austere mood. Simply put, this is one of the most unique and captivating fragrances I've ever experienced; and it is very much that- an experience. What more could be said about this treasure? I’ve had it in my rotation for about a year now and I’m possibly more in love now than I was then. Out of all the scents I wear from Tauer, the three that get the most compliments are this one, Orange Star, and Une Rose Chyprée. Tried to appreciate it. I bought it twice even to end up selling it. 
It reminds me of wet moldy papers underneath a bag of old clothes. 
I am just not in the rarified massive group of lovers that love this one. 
No, no, and more NO. Andy Tauer, a Swiss molecular biologist, gave it all up to become a perfumer. With no formal fragrance training, L’Air du Desert Marocain is only his second creation, but it’s now critically acclaimed, gaining a 5-star rating as “a masterpiece”. With his glowing legacy in mind, I’ve been late getting my hands/nose onto this superstar-de-parfum.
The opening wasn’t what I expected. Such sweet labdanum (reminiscent of Le Lebo’s ‘Labdanum 18’) combined with sweet incense with amber and woody, bitter twigs from orange petitgrain with spices. It’s so sweet, I had to double check there was no vanilla in it. There isn’t, but there might as well be. It’s way too sweet for me in the opening. The dry-down becomes a woody, bitter, but highly aromatic scent that remains very strong, never relents but fades to an underlying sweetness which still projects after many hours. On me, the dry-down becomes similar to Tom Fords ‘Noir De Noir’.
My expectation of a fragrance inspired by a nomadic Arab of the desert, is perfectly embodied by Amouage’s ‘Ubar’, which would be my preference over L’Air du Desert Marocain. @cylob thank you kindly very much appreciated. Seasons greetings. @freedomlover You might wanna get it straight from Andy Tauer. tauerperfumes.com delivers to UK as well. Hello need your help in based on the United Kingdom. Where could I buy Tauer fragrance from a reputable seller and not from eBay. Please message me where I can buy from in the United Kingdom. Thank you This fragrance definately delivers and I can see why people think it’s the best fragrance ever created. It’s smells like sexy cat nip. But even something as groundbreaking as this can have trouble blending in convetional spaces. What am I supposed to do walking around smelling like this? I smell like an Arab King and I’m a 5 foot 4 white woman. This one had to deliver on high expectations from its reputation.
Yep - it delivered! Held off for so long as the price for an EDT was off putting. It turned out I procrastinated too long.
It is well deserved in its reputation as unique. It just IS one of those perfumes.
It reminds me of a few things like:
- the colour purple
- dusk in the desert with a cool night coming on with your bare feet gripping the cooling sand and a cool wind blowing the scent of desert flowers and shrubs toward you
- a leather jacket covered in sugar
- vinyl records with sugar coated almonds nearby
Very emotive, strong but subtle so not going to knock people in a room over but strong enough that people will start sniffing the air nearby.
The amber, cumin, woods, labadnum, lavender keep it warm and the very subtle citrus and vetiver balancing it out making it cool at the same time. A weird scent with juxtapositions...
Unlike descriptions of a desert in the sun this very much reminds me of the opposite, like the time of the day where it is cold yet there is still warmth radiated by the rocks and earth... just like the marketing spiel...
Unique and definitely one of the perfumes that everyone must have or try like Serge Lutens Fille en Aiguilles or a Nasomatto for a take on the left field...
Just bought the beefed up EDP version Au Coer Du Desert... can’t wait... I would first compare L'Air du Desert Marocain to the edge of a sword: its so unified (without being simplistic), whole, it comes together perfectly, geometrically. There are two sides of it that dovetail perfectly: the 1) cinnamon bun sweetness and the 2) dry woody smokiness. The latter is transparent enough, and the former subdued enough, that the fragrance as a whole is like the nucleus of an atom with proton and neutron bonding tightly together. I believe this is a great example of what Mandy Aftel calls the ""burying"" or ""locking"" of two fragrance notes. The sweet side of it is red, and dry side is green, they are almost opposites, but when they come together, you get nothing but a white point of light. The message conveyed by this fragrance is psychedelic on one hand, and on the other hand, classical and above all, Platonic. I like Tauer perfumes because they all have this fearlessly Platonic theme. I don’t think there is a more calming and comforting scent out there. It’s peacefulness in a bottle. Especially now in cold weather when I think the incense comes out stronger. Which is funny because it does not have any listed but all together Andy Tauer managed to bring an incense-like accord from other notes. Like that calming feeling when you enter a cathedral, a forest in autumn (or an empty stadium - ok, this might not be such an elegant reference but for those who run track in their past lives may understand the feeling). I just smell oud. Is that strange no one seems to be mentioning it. Well made and all but man, that coriander note ruins this for me. I admit I can’t handle a strong coriander note in fragrances as all I smell is something that reminds me of a vinyl shower curtain freshly taken out of the wrapper. This why Kouros, Bottega Veneta Essence Aromatique and Gucci Rush all turn my stomach, they all have that creamy plasticy note. Take this review with a grain of salt as I can’t really give this scent a fair unbiased editoral, but anyone with a sensitivity to coriander beware of this one, its killer strong. This is a seductive but sort of dry (as in desert winds) fragrance. I quite like it but im not sure I LOVE it. Thats subjective, and in fact its growing on me. There is a lot of cedar and a hint of vanilla. It becomes drier and what some are calling harsher. But the harsh is very masculine and Ive noticed smells different depending on who is wearing it. SO try this one first. It works on me I think, and the harsh note, which has amber and vetiver, and im guessing the rock rose.... and then later one notices the jasmine and lavender. Not much lavender actually. But cutting across all of it is this very nice cedar note. It does, as someone said, smell like a rug shop in Rabat. Its that souk smell that is so captivating. Its definitely a man's fragrance I think. Its not carnal or animal sexy, and its not a dignified Saville Row scent. Its exotic but not heavy. And perhaps more for a man in his 30s and 40s. Or older depending.Not a classic I dont think, but its very very captivating all the same. Longevity is good.....projection is decent, but its not meant to be a loud scent. Good stuff and I find myself returning to it more than I might have thought. Have you ever been in a Persian rug shop? Have you ever visited an ancient mosque? Andy Tauer brought me back. It is not a simple shop smell but a work full of spicy and woody smells (merit of coriander and cumin). It is a scent that gives an infinite desire to isolate yourself from the world, to prostrate yourself among the sand dunes, to find your own inner oasis. Yes, it's really commendable.
Analysis: 9/10 Not a review just reporting on a comment i received while wearing this. Was in the post office sending off some frags when a guy asks 'Whats that your wearing?' I reply Tauer LDDM, to which he retorts 'Oh, smells just like Old Spice'! 
Talk about taking the jam out your doughnut!!
For what its worth, I love this stuff. Rich, dense, opulent, complex, a 10/10 for me. An iconic masterpiece that at the same time creates a definite problem for the wearer. Where does this scent fit? Who knows or cares, that's a problem of a lesser kind. This fragrance is a painting. It's meant to be admired not to ask where it should be hung. There's lots going on with this but to me what's left is a mix of spices (cumin, coriander) and gingerbread cookies. I cannot wear it, but I can admire it. Try before you buy. So I have been putting away on reviewing L'Air du Desert Marocain for quite a while since I thought I might not do it justice. However, I got my full bottle today, so I think the time is right. Straight from the get-go I get loads of cedar, cedar and more very realistic cedar. This lovely woody note is accompanied by a variety of spices (especially cumin, which subsides in a few minutes) and some sweetness pushing through, could be vanilla. Strangely it feels very nostalgic, and personal. It reminds me of my grandfather painting something in the balcony using an old wooden cabinet as a table or a stand. Basically it makes me think of a heated up wood cupboard with paint drying on a cloth canvas. As LDDM dries down, however, it gets sweeter, but never annoyingly so, kind of reminds me of gingerbread cookies. The longevity and projection are amazing, one spray is all you need, two if it's in the dead of winter when it is freezing outside.
In the end, what can I say? This is beyond special to me and it will always be one of my favourites (if not THE favourite) fragrances of all time. It really does transport you elsewhere, but to me it is not the Maroccan Desert, but my childhood home way in the past... Right at first whiff this fragrance brings old memories! because smells like classic and old fragrances that my grandfather and many guys back in those days used to wear. a classic and manly scent with great quality and blend.
Dry, green, very resinous and coniferous. A pleasure to wear. Hints of herbs and citrus flowers and quality of conifers which brightens any mood. Woods in the dry-down. 
As time passes by, those bitter resins and spices get weaker (they will stay till the end tough) and at the same time scent gets sweeter and a little more powdery.
In this part scent has a little dirty and kind of animalic feeling as well but it's very mellow.
Projection is good and above average and longevity is around 4-5 hours. The Dog by Francisco Goya I was excited about this as I imagined something spicy, warm and sensual - which it is probably on a different skin type and I'm sure it would be amazing on a man, but on me, it turns a bit masculine. In fact, it smells a bit like the shaving soap that my grandfather (a former barber) uses, so it is comforting but not necessarily something I would wear in my own skin. I bought a tester on Luckyscent, I love that we can properly test these niche scents that are very rarely middle of the road. I'd rather discover something is not what I thought than bore my nose to death with scents that were clearly designed by a committee of consumer researchers to please as many people as possible without truly delighting and of them. 
In conclusion, a great scent that you should try, it may just not be what it says on the bottle depending on your skin. Wow, this smells so beautiful, mysterious and alluring. It's one of those rare fragrances that take you on a journey. 
Just amazing.
9-9,5/10 I bought a bottle of L'Air du Desert Marocain last year, and have been wearing it at least once a week since then. This is a layered fragrance with many facets and nuances. It is a super-projector and even just one or two sprays lasts at least 9 hours on my skin. If you are a foodie like me, the first recognizable items would be cumin and coriander. A bombastic, assaulting bitter accord of oak moss, vetiver, birch and cedar follows, This is then somewhat tempered with a honeyed-resin ""amber"" accord (tons of cistus labdanum and perhaps benzoin/vanilla) and jasmine. This stuff keeps going and going. It is quite remarkable in the longevity department. An iconic oriental spicy/woody delight by Andy Tauer. From the bottle it smells like a strong Shalimar but with body heat it turns quickly very dry, cedar strong, maskuline. On my skin it's just shaving foam on a wooden barbershop brush. I wish I'd have other associations and could see the mastery like others do. I love that perfume, very nice fragrance with best performance. OK, got my 1 ml sample from Lucky Scent. When I first just dipped the dabber in the vile, and spread a tinny bit on my finger, it reminded me of a favorite fragrance, 80% the same: MFK Lumier Noire Pour Homme.
It beutifully blends patchouli, cummin, and rose, in a perfectly blended accord.
Then later I dabbed it on heavier, and it became quite a different fragrance. I got that harsh, dry desert air vib.
I was guessing I was going to smell amber, or labdanum, (rock rose resin) but not as I ever knew them. It's an amber accord, with some sharp synthetics and cumin, and vanilla.
This has a lot of virtual notes, like Le Labo fragrances. There are lots of aldehydes and synthetic notes, but done very well. Andy Tauer has a degree in chemistry and uses aroma chemicals masterfully here.
I think the dry, harsh desert air, comes from the synthetics. Then there is that soft and natural oriental accord, as in the Lumier Noire I mentioned; Patch, cummin, and Jasmine. It is a beautiful accord here, perfectly blended, to where you don't pick out the individual notes.
Like a musical chord, it has it's own identity, not easy to pick out the notes, unless your very musical.
I'm not sure I love this. I have harsh medecinal fragrances that are more wearable than Desert Moroccan, like MFK Cashmere Oud. What I like most about desert Moroccan, that patchouli floral accord, is done so much nicer in MFK Lumier Noire homme. It is more floral (rose) but the rose is well blended, and doesn't get feminine.
I can tell you this is a light oriental.
There is more Patchouli and Jasmine, and less amber than the note pyramid.
I'm sorry, but it does smell like a harsh household clenser at times, with some lavender added to soften the harshness. This is mostly just in the opening few minutes, it then begins to settle to something much nicer.
Gals if you kind of like this, but would like something a bit more feminine; I would suggest Lumiere Noire Pour Homme, or pour feme, or Narsiso Rodriguez for her.
I agree with many reviews, that it's not very wearable, but more interesting in an artistic way. 
I think my rating will be somewhat low, because I think a fragrance can be very artistic and wearable.
It smells a little soapy at times. I get something like a sweet medecinal candy, like Ricola; It's nice. One of the Moroccan city smells, wafting in... Someone mentioned, root beer, that's a good comparison.
OK, it does change and develope, with some transportive exotic smells, that are very pleasant. The cummin note is a big part of this exotic accord; it is very unique.
This fragrance is getting fun. It is very unusual in a fun and pleasant way. Reminding me of ELdO's fragrance ""Rien"" in that way.
Rating: 7/10
God bless. John 3:16 Oooh, this is realy nice... Vetiver, white & red floral, amber, vanilla (definitely vanilla, even though it doesn't say), white floral, amber, wood, vanilla, patchouli, vanilla, amber again, vetiver, oakmoss, amber & vanilla... Just had a bunch of coriander in my dinner, but I don't doubt that's in there too. Yup, dries down to an amber/vanilla/vetiver/oakmoss/patchouli. It layers well with *itself* God bless you, Andy Tauer :* This one is exactly like Frederic Malle’s Dries van Noten.
Only Dries van Noten stay’s longer on the skin and smells the same after 10 hours when I just sprayed it. Listening to the typical August storms roll through and wanting a little treat before bed, I picked up my sample and dabbed a bit on, just to revisit this strange little atmosphere in a vial. As bizarre as it sounds for such a heavy fragrance, this is absolutely astoundingly beautiful tonight! What on earth?! Of all the fragrances I would have designated for high summer, this was not one I would have even considered, but for whatever reason, it’s glorious. Maybe because it smells so parched; it’s one of the driest fragrance I have experienced. Somehow, in the suffocating summer humidity, LADDM gives the impression of an arid, expansive space and shimmers like a star. Well named, and perfect for a warm night. two words for this scent . Legendary fragrance . Further excited to try Au couer du desert It took me years to understand this perfume: L'Air du Desert Marocain is literally a trip. The start of this trip begins with a strong camphoreus patchoulli note, it's probably nightime, so the traveler needs a strong aura of courage and audacity! The night goes on and the amber comes to warm the traveler, there's a blanket made with spices, coriander and some jasmin for a little sleep. When the day is about to come, all the traveler gets with him is a vibrating vetiver scent indicating a new path. That's the end of the journey, or the beginning!"
7,Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996," Fig trees coastal orchard somewhere in southern Greece. Fresh sea breeze, peachy figs, milky crushed fig leaf sap, fig wood. This is a story perfume telling of realistic memories. 10/10 This review is for the body wash. I was hoping that this would smell like the Figuier candle and room freshener, but Phlyosikos is a different scent entirely. While Figuier is light and clean, Phylosikos is way too sweet and milky for my taste. I was too lazy to take it back so I used this up anyway. I must not have hated it. I made friends with a Macy's sales associate... she came over during the holidays and gifted us a Jimmy Choo box full of samples. 
My nose was still inexperienced at the time... The name and presentation of Philosykos and Diptyque intrigued me.
Oversprayed this on me wearing Pyjama pants and nothing else, curled up next to the fire under a blanket with my girl... I was honestly blown away at how good I smelled. 
This scent introduced me to photorealistic perfumery. 
I wonder if I'll chase that same Philosykos high forever.... I swear this scent depends on your body chem. This smells like a fig tree on me, the wood and sap included and doesn’t last long. But when my boyfriend uses it, it smells like a creamy fig fruit and it lasts until the morning. I think the weather is also a factor. It smells a little better on me during monsoon season. Philoskyos from Diptyque is a scent I don't wear very often because I am not quite sure what to make of it...and I don't know how to pronounce it, either. It is meant to be a perfumed ode to the fig tree in its entirety, the wood, the leaves and the fruit, but to be transparent here, I have never eaten a fresh fig, and even worse I sometimes get confused about dried figs and dried dates, so I'm already at a loss. What I do experience from this scent is the milky sap from a broken twig and the fragrance of spring greenery, damp from a morning rain. Despite that, it still comes off as dry, and I would expect it to also be fresh and light, but somehow it's strangely musty. I wear this on days when I know I've got a lot to think about, to remind myself that it's okay to not know everything, and maybe never reach a conclusion. On me this is a very long lasting (at least 12-15 hours) skin scent. It isn't screaming, as others have said, it is a whisperer. Very milky and creamy to me, bedtime scent, summer loveliness with open windows and the scent of green wafting over you! I love this. This scent takes me back to two years ago, on a hot summer day when me and my boyfriend took shelter in a nearby mall. We happened to pass by the dyptique store, this was when I discovered they had a perfume line. Philosykos was the first bottle I picked up, spritzing lightly on my neck, I was immediately engulfed in light and summery notes. There wasn’t an obvious alcohol scent, which was quite rare for most perfumes, you could very faintly make out the fragrance accords, but they were blended in perfect harmony. While the top grassy/fresh notes were prominent, the milky and creamy base notes were the perfect vehicle to carry the scent of figs. Honestly, this fragrance truly reminds me of a fig tree. Specifically the milky sap of the tree, brought out by light rainfall on a hot and hazy summer afternoon. It smelled so youthful and nostalgic, yet sophisticated and timeless. My boyfriend bought it for me soon after as I kept rambling on and on about how much I loved the way this fragrance diffused on my skin. It’s been two years and I have somewhat grown out of it, with only a quarter of the bottle left, I’ll leave this for a summer vacation to Europe. But the elegant philosykos bottle on my vanity will be forever emblematic of the joyful passing of time. Super pleasant! But, not what I was looking for when I bought a sample based on reviews and the notes. 
It is really nice and green initially. I would most definitely say even citrusy, my brain could be processing it that way because of the green notes + fig. I would say this scent is very soft and enjoyable. I get the fig (true, green fig) darn near the entire time. 
What I wanted out of this was the tree, cedar, and woods notes. I wanted to smell like a forest walk. To me, this is all soft plant, no sturdy tree and wood. I think it’s beautifully blended and I can kind of pick out how the cedar could be attributing to that, but right now I’m on a hunt for something where the wood notes have far more presence, and on me it’s not this. 
To me this is just a nice, fresh/green fragrance the whole time that had managed to not be screechy. Just not my type of thing. If you like that though, you’ll love this. Definitely a new favorite! Reminds me of those sweet old ladies who garden, drink tea, and read a lot of books. It’s one of the most realistic green fragrances I’ve tried. Smells exactly like what you read in the description. Love it! Wish the silage and longevity was a bit better, but I am grateful that this exists. Can’t complain! Great take on the Original fig perfume Olivia created for L’artisan. She surpassed her original creation for this one. 
Fig is one of those mute fruits where the perfume oil can’t be extracted. Olivia’s genius work to imitate the fig tree from her selection of olfactory notes is impeccable. I would go with the EDT, EDP is heavy on the coconut and cedarwood drydown! 
If you are curious about her work for diptyque check out oyedo, feu de bois, muguet, freesia, John galliano and mimosa. I’m not a particularly big fan of green scents. I expected the fig to be a little juicier and sweeter and was let down. This isn’t bad, it’s just not for me. Extremely green opening, literally smells exactly the way leaves smell when you rip them. The fig is more of an afterthought, especially in the dry down in my opinion. I get little to no woody notes. This is a really grassy and outdoorsy smell. Would be good for spring. It’s very mature IMO. Very interesting scent. I like reading everyones take on what it smells like. As a kid growing up in my parents house we had a garden with lots of plants. One in particular was a jasmine bush. When i would play outside i would pick the leaves from time to time. It was always interesting to me because this white milky substance would drip out the leaves once picked. It had sort of a green coconutty smell. That scent mixed with wet cement is what i smell with this perfume. I know it sounds weird but its actually nice and pretty unique. Tried this on my skin today for the first time, and I'm amazed at how beautiful it is. When sprayed on paper I get fresh, green fig, which smells great, but reminds me slightly of room spray - whereas on (my) skin, the coconut note blooms underneath it all, lending a soft, feminine, creamy quality to the scent, making it whole. 
Perfect summer daytime scent, although I can also see it making a great scent to wear to bed, with how calming and soothing it is. 
When I picture who would wear this and in what scenario, I see an attractive woman in her 40s with tanned olive skin, black curls, simplistic makeup and a summer dress.. reading a book in the shade of her lush backyard garden.
Great job Diptyque. I want to love this but unfortunately it is my least favorite scent from Diptyque. I don’t HATE it but sadly all I smell is Comet, the green powder in a can that’s used to clean bathrooms. I came back to this today after not having smelled for a few years. Today is almost a spring day, sunny and relatively warm compared to the snow and ice of the past few weeks and I wanted something green to wear. This fit the bill perfectly. It smells like fresh green plants sprouting up in a newly warmed sun. Bright and happy and fresh. I’m so glad I decided to wear this today. This is green, green, green fig! Imagine that the fig grew on a plant instead of a tree. Then imagine breaking off a lusciously plump green stalk and watching the white milk sap slowly ooze from the plant while you're surrounded by tempting not-quite-ripe figs all around you. That's this fragrance.
Sillage isn't huge on me but the longevity is good...we're at 6 hours and I can still smell it although it's a skin scent. Maybe applying to clothing will improve the sillage!
The coconut rounds out the green notes from becoming too sharp or bitter, and this is as close to a real green fig scent than you'll ever find. Not too sweet and really on point with Mother Nature. A real treat for fig fans! Fig is one of my favorite fruits. So I blind bought this. 100% happy with the purchase!
It is a lush fig tree with some figs sprinkle here and there. Green, juicy, woody. This is The One that started it all. 
It was probably around 2002. I was still living in Boston, young, early career and broke. My signature scent at the time was mostly Givency Amarige and sometimes Mugler Angel in the winter. I always loved perfume but tended to have 2-3 max. One day I was in Neimans in the Copley mall and stumbled upon the Diptyque section. Loved the bottles and aesthetics! I think Philosykos cost about $88 for the largest size at this time and I thought it was SO expensive. After sniffing Philosykos, perfume was to become an obsession for me. I was used to perfumes smelling like 80s-90s mainstream designer stuff; mostly synthetic and “like perfume.” Philosykos was a whole scene, a whole experience, so new and different. I was mesmerized by Philosykos. Figs, leaves, branches, the whole freaking tree! I left Neimans with that bottle thinking it was so pricey I wouldn’t be able to eat the rest of the month. I loved wearing every spritz of that bottle. Thank you, Diptyque, and thank you Olivia Giacobetti, for making this amazing fragrance. 💜 Just WOW. 
Beautiful, clean, natural, and perfectly captures the green fig tree in summer where you can smell a subtle sap from the leaves.
THE BEST FIG PERFUME. I've compared it to l'artisan and acqua di parma, and this is hands-down the best. It mimic the green fig tree the best, and not overly sweet. Just something you'd wanna keep smelling and don't get tired of easily. Got a sample from a Diptyque store here in LA. I'm late to the party. This is the most realistic fig fragrance (and the only one I've put my nose on so far). Philosykos is so milky and juicy, the coconut note sealed the deal for me. This is one of my top targets for 2021, and I can't wait to own a bottle. It only lasts about 5-6 hours, but those are the best 5-6 hours you'll experience throughout your day. Performance might be average at best, but the scent is to die for. Projects somewhat heavy for the first hour-hour and a half. Very unisex. Anyone can wear it. It doesn't smell dated at all. Has stood the test of time, and I'm glad it did. Best for warmer weather, more causal that formal, and more of a day scent than a night scent. Literally, anyone can wear this. This is so fresh, clean, green, creamy, milky and sweet! It’s amazing. This is a good signature scent because you can wear it all year round. 
In the winter Layer this with Diptyque Tam Dao! It’s amazing! Gia1913 has it spot on. I feel the exact same way towards Philosykos: sometimes I enjoy it to the point I want to call it my favorite perfume ever, but the next day the idea of wearing it again seems crazy to me. Smelled up close, the green notes remind me of freshly crushed tree leaves, which is highly vegetal and almost bitter. This sharpness is reminiscent of some kind of plastic I can't exactly put my finger on. But smelled from a distance, Philosykos is delicious. It's one of the only ""cozy"" green fragrances I've smelled. Take your time with it and hold on to your sample. Conflicting perfume. I love it some days, and I hate it on other days. It could smell like the most fresh, green, sappy fig leaf with beautiful drydown of milky coconut fig, or it could smell like plastic and give you a headache. It also depends on the weather, the skin or fabric. It's addicting when it is, and disgusting when it is. I need to contextualise this review. I am generally not a fan of green fragrances. Herbaceous, grassy, and the like is usually enough for me to avoid a fragrance. Green Irish Tweed by Creed is my idea of waterboarding. I love Philosykos by Diptyque. I love the fig notes. Fig notes that are multidimensional and include the leaf, sap, fruit, and even the bark. I love the initial. I love the dry down. I love the subtle coconut and the woods (that pay homage to the fig tree) that linger. The artistry displayed in the development of Philosykos is writ large. You can not sleep on anything by Diptyque, but this one is remarkable. Smells, lush, green...wet. Its really sexy if you understand it. 
The fig makes it juicy and sweet and makes the crisp chewy greens and in the far far away distance, fresh coconut. 
This reminds of Greece. 
Its balanced, warm, singular, fresh but rich. Perfect for autumn or summer evenings. If you spray this on you you will literally smell like a tree. It's so ""green"" it's like splashing green paint all over you. After about 20 minutes a touch of woody notes come alive but nope, it's still green. At the end I can pick up a faint coconut note which sweetens it up a bit but at that point I don't care anymore. I am convinced I am a fig tree. 
That said I have a lot of admiration for the uniqueness and craftsmanship it took to make this perfume. 
Green is just not my color. It opens up as if you just crush some fig leaves between your palms, very very green and milky (in a leafy sense not in a dairy sense). When it dries down a bit, it turns out to be something still quite green, fruity and sweet. If Tam Dao makes me feel like a walking temple, Philosykos makes me feel like I am a tree and I can actually photosynthesise under the sun but in a good way. A must have for me. I was very excited to try this one out. I was disappointed. The opening smells exactly like green nuts before they ripen. If you have had green almonds or pistachios, then you know what i'm talking about. The dry down is nice with a milky coconut accord. What I like in Philosykos: realistic green notes which smell literally as if you were crushing green leaves in your hands. Nice. Also, some airy freshness, like the wind moving through branches of a tree. I love this bit. Overall the scent is very smooth, clean and somehow noble.
The green notes don't last very long. It becomes more woody and also fig and coconut notes are prominent. I keep testing fragrances featuring fig or fig leaf notes and I absolutely adore them one day, and dislike on another. There is something in Philosykos though which made me put it on my 'love' shelf and it's staying there for now. I really disliked this. The top note is very sharp, bitter and grassy. Coconut makes this cloying and headache-inducing. The combined scent smells like Playdoh. I had to wash this off. I was very disappointed. Nature in a bottle.
It evokes memories of running through a field after rain. Climbing through leaves on tree tops. Lying in the mossy undergrowth of a forest. Freshly cut damp grass.
This fragrance provides more of an experience. It's an amazing achievement to have this in a bottle. 
This is something I would wear by myself for myself, a little bottle of memories, to wear on my own for comfort. Possibly while out for a walk in the cold crisp air through a forest, I'm not sure. It isn't one I would choose for an event or night out.
All in all, very pleasant. A nice experience. Expensive for something that I wouldn't get a lot of wear out of. I will be donating to a friend who will hopefully get a bit more use out of it. This is what hooked me on niche fragrances and I've never looked back once, more than twenty years ago. This needs no review from me, I'm just here for a tip for fellow frag heads. I discovered that Philosykos, topped up with Black Saffron by Byredo is the most divine combination. I'm not a fan of layering. But these two together- WHOOOO boy- it's a trip. Too green for me. This is fig leaves, even though the notes mention the fruit or other notes, I don't get these. This is very natural. I find it comforting. The opening is green, fresh, and realistic. Someone said it smells like the inside of split open branch. I definitely get that. Then you get a hint of coconut and fig. And the dry down is my favorite—soft, creamy woods. Sample this for about 2 days. Basically, if you want to smell like a walking Fig Tree in a green place (I did) this is the scent for you. It is the smell of clean greeness. It's not very long lasting, so make sure you overspray this, and spray on clothes too. I did that I kept smelling it on myself all day, in a pleasing way. I like it, but I like Tam Dao more. A natural, unisex, happy fig scent for anyone in any season.
As many have said before me, this is a lovely realistic fig, tree and all. So expect green rather than fruity gourmand fig. I don't really get the coconut or cedar, just the fig. I find it quite linear but I don't mind as I capital-L-Love fig. I can wear this any place, time, or season. It's a good stand-by for when I can't decide on a scent--it's very calming and inoffensive. A bright summer's day, walking through a freshly pruned fig orchard. Branches and leaves still lay on the grass beneath. Fruit is near ripe, awaiting harvest, releasing their fragrance gently. You pick off a fig and white sap gathers at the top as you breathe deeply. That's the scent of this fragrance. Green like freshly grounded leaves. The ones my grandma used to put on my hair to kill lice. Brings back childhood memories. Haha. I'll just pass. Finally got my hands on Philosykos, and I'm now thinking of selling all my other perfumes.
This is so clean, soft and sweet. I love the bottle, love the scent. Everything that other reviewers have stated concerning the pros of this product I would agree with, with one caveat. On my male skin, it turns to a powdery and floral aroma that is too feminine for my liking. The dry down lessens that quality but I still smell too much like a florist’s assistant for my liking. For those that like this fragrance, the longevity and quality are undeniable. A recommended purchase for those of a different skin chemistry. This perfume totally changed my mind about perfumery and got me hooked for ever. This is an artistic fragrance, a great representation of the smell of the fig tree. I got very good comments, everyone liked the fact it smelled so natural. If people can notice it on your skin they will love it. It's so original, very unisex dark mysterious, simply wonderful !
I have an issue with performance, but it did well on others skins. Diptyque has a lot of fantastic and amazing perfumes that smell so great. My top 3 from this house are: Philosykos, Tam Dao and Eau Duelle. (Am am a male who is ""trans-fragrance"" so if this review comes off as sexist in any way - I apologize greatly. My aim is to steer people in the right direction ) .
My first Diptyque as well. I sampled this a year ago- and it had a strange effect on me-- like ""baby in a crib"" happy! I was aghast at what a LARGE bottle this ""niche"" entailed! Happy happy on that point! (I'm more used to 2.5 ml. on most). Single alpha-Men & younger men in general will probably hate this as it has the said ""baby's crib head"" vibe. So not a safe BLIND BUY for A-Men. Women - especially over 40 will cling to this like it's a built-in function. I shall not bother to explain the notes and specifics: rather the feel is , so mellow and free. Like you have the whole week off and this is day one! Or it's Spring and that last day of school is tomorrow. This is an ""anti-perfume"" that evokes feelings likes it's nobody elses business. The ""milk"" aspect makes this lean female by nature. Again , MEN may not be happy with this as a ""blind buy"". I shall be making another Diptyque blind buy soon! Philosykos is my first Diptyque. The quality is good but it is very expensive. 
I would say Philosykos is a unisex perfume and a moderate projector. After two hours you need to move about for it to project; it's a skin scent four hours in and mostly gone after five hours. 
The first blast gives off a smell reminiscent of grass and fresh earth after the rain with a touch of woody notes, a hint of coconut and a touch of fig. The fig in question is not the fruit but the leaves and the fig tree. Around an hour and a half later the grass and fresh earth has changed to a more herby smell and a slightly different set of green notes. It's still a creamy fig smell over it. I don't get any cedar though. 
I would sooner have Hermes Un Jardin En Mediteranee for a fig leaf scent than Philosykos or perhaps the Monotheme Mediterranean Coast. They're both considerably better value and the Hermes is a better perfume. Nevertheless, anyone interested in fig as a note should give this a try.
Best creamy fig perfume. Tried out the EDP, which smells like a dead ringer for 痱子粉 (Chinese baby diaper rash powder) and crushed leaves on me the whole time. I do smell the coconut note, but overall baby rash powder, which trust me, is not what you want to evoke for others. Very linear for me, did not get any woody notes. Sickly potent and strong sillage for a good 3 hours before fading bit by bit, gave me a headache and I was trying to wipe it off all day at work. Definitely goes on the no purchase list. Well made green fig scent, which smells quite natural. Opening is green and watery, while later stages become a bit more milky and woody because of the added coconut accord. Fairly basic in its execution but for someone who is new to fig based scents a good one to start out with. In typical Giacobetti style, it's ethereal and pleasant, lasting mere hours. Perfect for spring and summer. Suitable for nearly any occasion but I'd leave it for day wear. 
7/10 Philosykos is a coconutty green and wet fragrance. I see myself wearing it more on a rainy summer. It is the most unique smelling fragrance I own as expected from a niche brand.
On paper, it smells like crushed grass. Better test this on the skin or it wouldn't do you justice. To me, it smells like a room fragrance that I would want to wear. I love this... if it were for the TERRIBLE performance. You will get more out of it if you spray on your clothes.
Will I repurchase? NO. Longevity sucks. I have never seen or been close a fig tree, so I cannot comment on to the realism of this fragrance. Although Olivia Giacobetti created Premier Figuier (1994) two years before she created Philosykos (1996) I'll take Luca Turin at his word that Philosykos is ""the first proper fig in perfumery."" This review is for the EDT, which is the original formulation. The EDP (2012), which Giacobetti also worked on, is slightly different, with more emphasis on the milky, coconut notes. 
Although I love many floral fragrances, I have found only a few florals that I really enjoy wearing in the summer. This summer I added Beyond Paradise (2003), Bronze Goddess (2008) and Waterlily Sun (2014) in my perfume collection. Each of these florals are summer personified in their own way. As much as I love my newly acquired summer florals, my absolute favourite summer fragrances are those that distinctly smell of summer, but belong to other fragrance families. 
Philosykos is inspired by the smell of a fig tree, not just the fruit, but the entire tree including the leaves, the sap, and the wood. It is a distinctly woody fragrance with fresh, green, fruity notes that is so unique and refreshing for summer. To me Philosykos has a cool, dark, almost gothic quality to it. It's the fragrance I reach for on hot days when I'm wearing a black dress and dark sunglasses. Philosykos is a a modern classic, a fragrance that I'll continually repurchase. Also, how gorgeous are the illustrations on Diptyque's perfume bottles? They visually do exactly what a great fragrance is supposed to do, allow you to imagine yourself in other time or place. I found this to be a very versatile scent but more suited for warmer weather. Here in sunny California with our Mediterranean climate it's just perfect. This was my first Diptyque fragrance but not my first foray into fig scents. Philosykos reminds me of Marc Jacobs pour homme. I definitely smell the fig and coconut which lingers prominently throughout the drydown. I can see how others characterize this scent as an ""experience"" as it is evocative of an afternoon spent under a fig tree. Philosykos is very pleasant and you can't go wrong with this choice, that's if you don't fancy figs. It was one of my preferred choices in the Diptyque line. I agree with L.bss re: wearability. This is my first Diptyque fragrance so I'm not sure how Philosykos compares to others from the brand, but I've read a bit about the company and it seems to me they're less concerned with creating something that will make a human smell nice rather than selling an experience. That's what this is. An experience of a summer day under a fig tree; fruit, leaf, bark and warm, light air sweet with all its fragrances. This could be a room spray or a scented candle. Not to sell it short - on the contrary; it's extremely high quality. But it does indeed raise the question of wearability. If you want to smell like an experience, then this is for you. But there are people who want their perfumes to make them smell nice in a human way and that's not exactly what Philosykos does. 
So, whereas witch_mum said this is unisex, I would actually call this genderless (there's a difference). I agree that Hermes' Jardin en Mediterranee is more in the 'unisex' category; I find that one to be an experience scent as well, but with a bit more of that human, 'perfume-y' quality to it than Philosykos, a bit more concerned with wearability. When I described Hermes' Un Jardin en Mediterranee as the mother of all fig scent, then this here is the grandmother.
A very dry fig without any sweetness and the coconut goes without the Bounty-like sweetness, too. 
This is much more a unisex scent IMO as the mentioned Hermes scent.
EDT has moderate longevity and sillage on my skin. This is fig! nothing else! everything, you start with this incredibly green sappy fragrance (some pepper to wake it up I believe) and the slightest sweetish aroma of the fruit. Great balance btw salt and glucose. So authentic on this base of woods. very vegetal and elegant.
I am a bit puzzled by the wearability, it's great! but a bit soft and I wouldn't be sure on which occasion I could use it. Maybe it reminds me of the stickiness the fruit leaves on your hands that stops me to use it in public😂 besides jokes, it's great! Figs.
Will that do?
OK, bit more info needed. This is a classy scent, nothing harsh, cheap, or synthetic about it. First spray you get a lovely warm sweet creamy aroma of figs. Then the initial hit dies down a little, and you're left with a warm creamy aroma of figs. Figs themselves, fig leaves crushed, the whole fig tree. There's a very, very slight undertone of cedar, a coconutty cedar, but mainly figs.
I got about 5 hours smell from 3 short poofs, on warm skin on a warm evening. Morning after, can't smell it on me anymore. Sillage is moderate.
Is it worth the money? I would say yes, if you love figs obviously. This opens very green and a bit humid but quickly turns to a creamy, milky, coconut/fig. I love the drydown so much. Disclaimer: I do not have the original perfume, I have a perfume oil which is supposed to be identical to it and this describes my impression of that scent. I will however not be able to comment on the original's longevity or sillage. If this is not allowed, I would appreciate it being pointed out to me and I will gladly remove this review. This only serves to give an impression of the scent as I experienced it. 
EDIT: In the meantime, I have acquired the original EdT and am glad to report that it is indeed identical to the oil I have so feel free to disregard the disclaimer. I would categorise the sillage of the EdT as 'polite' and the longevity as 'moderate' - 'long'. 
It opens green, dry and vegetal to me. It quickly softens to a creamy, soft green. It's fresh and natural, but not in a particularly 'airy' way. There's a slight zest to it, something almost minty in its nature, but it never goes the whole nine yards to become too spicy in its freshness nor too sharp in its greenness. The creamy aspect is definitely the foundation here, giving the green notes their fair share of free rein but never unleashing them entirely. 
There's a subtle sweetness to the creamy aspect; for some weird reason, it makes me think of mashed banana. Not the smell but more like the consistency in a way. If consistency itself had a smell, this creamy base would be it. It's warm but not suffocating, a bit like sunscreen in terms of warmth. This works beautifully in heat and/or humidity but I could see it being cosy enough for spring and maybe early autumn as well. 
It's a strange mix of a clear yet opaque scent. I'm not sure I'm expressing myself correctly or intelligibly, I apologise. What I mean is, there is something crisp and fresh here but it's as though there's this slightly milky haze enveloping those notes, like a light summer mist in a lush garden.
For some reason this evokes the imagery of dark summer shade to me which is probably the fig. Even more than that though, it makes me think of water. Dark, deep blue water, cool and fresh and quiet. Balenciaga's L'Essence and Calvin Klein's Truth, both of which I have and love, do much the same thing to me. Maybe it's just me, but I get a similar base vibe from all three, executed in different ways. L'Essence is a summer garden wet with fat raindrops; Truth is a dive into a pond in a forest; Philosykos is like a little secret garden on a summer's day, cool with tree shade, a bit like Elio's secret hideout spot in Call Me By Your Name.
All in all a very lovely summer scent and, so far, a real compliment magnet. Very unique but kept pleasant enough as not to offend or annoy. I'm not sure yet whether I consider that a point in its favour or not. I do like my quiet, introspective greens, but the ones I've had and loved so far have always had a bit of a risky edge to them while Philosykos never seems quite daring enough to make much of a statement that way if you know what I mean. On the other hand, this might be a good thing as it is unique enough in and of itself and very well done, no need for an exclamation mark. This is growing on me very quickly. The longer I wear it, the more I fall in love. Top note is so green and natural scent. When dry down,this one smell like rubber (in a good way), but I can't found coconut scent on it. Insanely realistic natural fig scent, the tree more so than the actual fruit. Well, there is some fruitiness to it but rather of unripe figs. Personally I cant distinguish the coconut or any other notes, nevertheless it is a very rounded scent that perfectly captures summer in the Mediterranean countryside.
It's the first fig fragrance I ever smelled and even though I was very intrigued right from the start, as a scent it was still a bit more green and natural than what I was used to back then, when I first smelled it. So while I'd still put some on a test paper strip whenever I walked by it, I'd still never pick it up.
Finally I ended up buying Attique by Lubin, which to my nose was similarly natural but a lot more fruity, instead.
But I am glad I got introduced to fig as a fragrance note by this perfume. It's a lovely fragrance. I'd recommend it to anyone to give it a try.
Sillage, however, is very soft. You'll get it wafting around you a little bit for the first hour. Longevity on me in very humid and warm climate is up to 3 hrs, which is a bit of a shame, so keep that in mind. WOW! So pretty. Just got a sample of this - at first I was already wearing a perfume so I just sprayed it on some cardboard. That didn't do it justice - it just smelled like green leaves/green notes. However, on the skin, the coconut and fig really come forward. The coconut is like real, fresh coconut milk/flesh - not cheapy fake coconut like in more youthful and/or B&BW scents. The green notes are still there but melded perfectly with the coconut and fig to create this beautiful, light, fresh, slightly sweet spring/summer scent. Can't wait to get a full size! Plus Diptyque is cruelty free, so A+ in my book! I love the smell of figs, but it's one of those scents that can easily be one-note or veer off into candle or room spray territory. The fig fragrances I've tried that feel like true perfumes to me are few - L'Artisan Premier Figuier, Annick Goutal Ninfeo Mio and Diptyque Philosykos. Obviously I haven't tried them all so forgive me if I've left out your favorite:)
Premier Figuier and Philosykos both have an earthy, green, woody opening that evolves into creamy, coconutty, sun-ripened figs with a hint of leaves and branches. I find Philosykos to have more depth and last longer on my skin so I went with it over Premier Figuier, but in my opinion they both have very similar personality.
Ninfeo Mio is more like walking into a giant garden and strolling through the fig grove. It opens with an almost bitter green and citrus top note. Ninfeo Mio stays airy and crisp but it develops with warm woods and fig to round out the sharpness.
I get moderate projection and staying power from both Philosykos and Ninfeo Mio. Wearing either of these fig scents is a mood-lifter and I enjoy them year round. Philosykos is a little sweet for the hottest summer weather, and Ninfeo Mio is a bit fresh for cool weather. To me they represent the two ends of the fig perfume spectrum - green and sharp to creamy and ripe. I love both! This smells exactly like a fig leaf or a branch that you have broken in your hands and sniff. I don’t mean it “sort of” smells like that but it smells perfumey or powdery it smells EXACTLY like crushed up fig leaves with a little bit of milky green fig. I don’t get any other notes other than those 2.I don’t know if I really want to smell like a photorealistic green leaf. Personally I prefer Premier Figuier it smells incredibly similar but it’s more nutty, smooth, and more well rounded with the other notes but still ver leafy, figgy, and green. Opens up very figgy, then becomes a green, coconut skin scent. Disappears after about 5-6 hours. This is the first scent when I know about Diptyque. Today I just buy it and have time to learning together again, the top note is a very fresh cut fig leaf for me, so amazing I feels like I am walking in the morning inside the fig garden, wearing t-shirt and in my hand it was a wood sculpture that I don’t know why I hold it in my arms. Yes! it was a great combination between the greenary with woody scent! always warming and relaxing. I really love this fragrance eventhough I prefer floral scent more, but this one always remind my memory when I first sniff the fragrance from Diptyque. The nectarine/peach comparison is spot on. Literally, spot on. It's like when you're well in to eating the fruit, in the wet, fleshy heart. It's a fruit that's undeniably nice but it's not necessarily a pleasant experience (in my opinion). It's not really a 'moreish' fruit - and in this sense, nor is this fragrance. It can be nice, but there's always something about it that is in danger of jarring and becoming annoying, even cloying.
Other than that, it's fresh, fresh greenery - fig, yes, but a smell of wet greenery if you can avoid thinking about peaches.
Honestly, I really like this. Not sure I'd want to wear it, per se, as although it's undoubtedly unisex as it's almost an aroma rather than a perfume, it feels jarring on my skin and too feminine.
A lovely, bright, fresh, natural-smelling fragrance...but not one where I want to buy a full bottle.
7/10
*original review posted Jun 1 2019* i really wanted to love this. but on my skin, it's only coconut and disappear after 2 hours. i give ot to my best friend and i really enjoy it on him. i wish it works on me bcs it' realy really easy going scent. Green, but the edges are soft, and rounded. Lovely sillage that gives off a coconut scent. Comfort in a bottle! Sweet figs and creamy coconut morph into dryer woody (but still figgy) notes. There's something a bit aquatic in the drydown as well, which lends even more to the Mediterranean atmosphere. Unique and wonderful. This smells pleasant, and is easy to like and even to love. But does it work as a wearable fragrance? I agree with those that say it smells like a fig tree or a fig branch. Yes.. that's a nice smell. Is it something I particularly want to smell like day to day? I don't know. 
Smelling this brings me imaginary thoughts of strolling through an orchard of fig trees in the spring time. It's definitely not an offensive smell. It's a light, pleasurable scent. But it doesn't really smell like a cologne/perfume. It smells like trees. Literally, like trees. 
After reading about this, I was almost about to pull the trigger on a blind buy bottle. But I'm glad I didn't. This isn't a bad fragrance at all. It's very enjoyable. It's not boring either. Nothing else really smells like it. But I don't really have much interest in smelling like a grove of fig trees. There are some green notes that LITERALLY smell like that smell when you split open a tree branch. It brings me back to my childhood, having play sword fights with tree branches. It's an engrossing and beautiful scent. But do I want this as my cologne? I can't say that I do. I can think of several green fragrances I'd take over this if I want a green scent. 
Does this make it a bad scent? No. Just definitely not for me. Is it for you? I don't know. But this one is definitely not a blind buy. You might love it and want it right away. You might hate it. You might love it, but still can't bring yourself to want to wear it, like me. Only you can decide.. and that's why it's not a blind buy. It's something you'll probably at the very least LIKE if not love. But like, love, or not... this one's different enough that you'll probably benefit from trying before buying. This a very unique fragrance initially I was drawn to it because I love coconut notes and you can really smell the creamy coconut note but then my sister mentioned that it smells like raw eggplant and now I can’t get that out of my head it kinda does smell like that I purchased Philosykos EDT just before Christmas 2019 and love it so much! It is a very green and fresh scent with a hint of coconut. I can't get enough of it! Unfortunately the silllage is very poor and I have to spray a lot of it and even then it doesn't last very long on the skin or on clothes. I have since purchased the EDP and bring the EDT out with me to top up throughout the day. Between the two, I still prefer the scent of the EDT but they're honestly very very similar. Philosykos EDP is just more green and naturally stronger and longer lasting as it is a parfum. I thoroughly enjoy having both in my collection, but will only repurchase the Parfum once this runs out. Went through a 1mL sample and bought a bottle immediately. 
Wearable in all occasions. Totally safe for work or being around sensitive people.
Absolutely sings in the spring and summer, but I still enjoy wearing it in the colder months because it is very creamy.
A true work of art! This is a review for the solid perfume in the little, heavy, embossed black case. I honestly don’t know if this is the EDT version or the EDP version. It was a gift from a friend who knows I’m obsessed with fig notes, and because we travel together, it’s the perfect perfume to take on a trip. No worry of spills or breakage.
That said, I’m not a fan of solids. I can’t tell if it’s the perfume or if this really has zero projection. Skin scent from start to finish. I can smell fig and some woods. Lovely but very light. I can not recommend the solid, go for the EDT or EDP instead.
I will need to do a proper EDP review in the near future. I own several fig scents and this is really the cream of the crop so far, very realistic and super fruity. On my skin, it opens up with the characteristical fig tree, but soon warms up into a coconutty fig and stays that way for as long as it lasts. The projection on my skin is quite strong with only one spritz, but as I love it, I can't complain. If you like green, fruity scents, this is signature-worthy all the way. I will try to use it with Jardin Mediterraneé from Hermés to see if I can amp up the dry aspect of it, to make it even better.
2/27 Update: I'm trying it in combination with Un Jardin en Mediterraneé, and I have to say the astringent notes of UJeM just blend exquisitely with the creaminess of Philosykos. Glorious. If you have both, give it try; you won't regret it.
8/10 A masterpiece, honestly.
There's a fig tree near the marina where I work, and I recently picked an unripe fruit and got the milky sap all over my hands. This is exactly what that smells like.
Unlike the L'Artisan Premier Figuier, this is much less sweet, and I'd say even a little bitter, and so woody.
I honestly don't get much coconut in this one, which I'm thankful for, as most coconut fragrances are endlessly nauseating to me. They always smell synthetic and so unlike real, freshly opened coconuts like the ones I grew up eating in the Philippines. Nice review by modernwarpaint below.
She says it smells like a split open branch.
That's what I wanted to emphesis. I put this as my signature for Fall.
It is so clean and natural.
It smells like when I was young and peeled the bark from a green branch. This is a fig branch, with the green wood.
When I dont know what to wear, this is a great go to frag. It will never be offensive. Almost a natural non-fragrance kind of smell. Philosykos was my introduction into niche perfumes. I told the SA that I was looking for something green, grassy, nature-inspired, and she handed me this.
It opens with a green, astringent, split open live branch. It's fresh, hyper-realistic vegetal note that immediately conjured up a lost memory.
The memory of me walking around the fence perimeter of my childhood playground. Listening to Pearl Jam's Ten in my Walkman while the rest of the kids played on the jungle gym. 
Yes, I was the weird, introspective, artsy kid.
In the corner of the playground, I noticed some sappy fruits peaking through the fence from a fig tree. At the time, I didn't know. My curiosity was piqued and I picked the fruit and opened it up. The branch produced a milky sap. I recall the forest green leaves, like sandpaper. I tasted the mildly sweet, jammy fruit without reservations. 
This was the age of innocence, curiosity, adventure, and when the entire world was at my fingertips...the carefree days before technology became commonplace...the days when children played outside and not behind a screen.
To me, this perfume is that memory in a bottle. This is the second perfume I ever bought! I spritzed it on my arm when I was in the store and was thinking I should at least wait a couple of hourS before making any purchase decisions. I could not stop sniffing my arm in the first 10 minutes and then I went back to the store and bought it! 
It starts with a very green scent, like crushed leaves and then the fig and creamy coconut start to emerge. It smells like a Greek garden. And to me, this is what heaven smells like. :) 
The only thing is it sometimes smells a bit too sour on my skin. But that maybe just my body chemistry. I spray it in my hair instead and it does not have any sour notes. 
Longevity was not long but decent - in Asia it is usually quite hot so it fades in a couple of hours. I do not mind reapplying and smell the green again. Spillage was also quite okay - I got waves of figs, leaves and coconut when I move my head. A tropical candle but in the best way possible. I get a creamy coconut milk and fig leaf scent. It's fresh, green, a bit sweet, and most importantly it doesn't smell cheap. This smells like a candle but in perfume form. It smells like its meant to be worn on skin and not synthetic like some perfumes can be (like they would be better suited as a candle/room spray). This smells like a summer safari in the rainforest but such a memory that could be accessed any time of year without smelling out of place. I'd want to wear this any time of the year, even in cold weather where I may need a bit of a pick me up to remind me of sunny days and the beauty of nature when all our trees are withered away and the wildlife is hibernating. 
I can't stress enough how ~Natural~ this perfume smells and feels. It's one of the most high quality tropical scents I've ever experienced. I'm currently on a no-buy but once that is finished and a few more bottles leave my collection this is at the top of my must purchase list, and a big bottle at that. The ""clone"" from the Body Shop does not even come close! Don't waste your $19.99 on it. The more I try other figs, more I appreciate Philosykos.
I use to climb fig trees as a child and this is the closest one to the real deal. And the only one I can tolerate in the long run. 
I'm not sure it should be longer lasting, the fixatives used just blur the naturality of the fruit or even worse, leaf. Feuille de Figuier from Roger & Gallet is great example, the benzoin, almost tonka-like, mellows the aromatic sharpness and that green bite, but it gives surprising longevity. It's also the question of taste. And priorities, I suppose.
And for those who complain about coconut, the fig leaf sap really smells milky and coconutty and also very green, aromatic, woody and it's an intense love or hate story. I sampled this at SpaceNK. I initially enjoyed the scent but within an hour I had to scrub it off my skin as it made me nauseous. Even though there are ""green"" elements, I found the overall scent to be too warm/sweet. I felt it didn't have a deep enough basenote to balance the fig or coconut. WOW, really green. I get bare a hint of fig and coconut, it is all green leaves and wood. I bought this because it was close in notes to Fico Di Amalfi but you could not get a more different outcome.
-----
I've played with it a bit more now and the top notes are a deeply wet green which is refreshing, and given time the creamy Coconut comes through to round it off. It's a lovely scent, absent anything floral or citrus, and very natural/true to life. It's really growing on me, for those times that Fico Di Amalfi is too citrus sharp and Italian Summer Fig is too synthetic floral. This is not a safe blind buy to my mind.I get some peach in it but mostly smells like a bunch of dandelions with light coconut,reminds me of childhood. Not sure if I want to smell like dandelions.Very green though. Lovely scent that disappears in a couple of hours, smells similar to premier figuier extreme but with less performance and higher price tag. Too expensive to be spritzing all day Finally got chance to try this at Barney's. After having read so many positive reviews, I was very curious to do so. And I must say it lived up to the hype. Very lovely. Maybe it is because it shares notes with my favorite perfume, Hermes Un Jardin en Mediterranee. Both have fig leaf. Here, the the fig leaf is accompanied by the fig fruit and fig tree (now THAT is a lot of fig!) I would like to have some extended time with this one. If it has better longevity than the Hermes, maybe it can take over first place in my heart (nose?).. Fig lovers ought to like it a lot. This fragrance touches my heart and my eyes fills with tears when I smell it! Maybe it reminds me of good memories from my chidlhood? I dont know. Philosykos extremly beautiful perfume. If someone don't like it, maybe they are in trouble? It is just sentimental. Extremely green and very fresh and leafy. This has to be the greenest fig - not at all fruity, compared with the Artisan Parfumeur's fig. A classic, but not for everyone. If you like green notes just grab it thought, you are not going to regret it. Green, transparent, clean and creamy. Could be a rainy day scent, very similar to quadrifoglio without any of the herbal dewey notes. I'm not a fan of coconut but this one is done nicely. A woman would smell lovely wearing this. A benchmark green fragrance. Ultra realistic. A soft and short affair but undoubtedly beautiful. A must-try. 
9/10 I'm sorry for myself to believed all these reviews saying its a great perfume. I put my high expectations & blind buy this. But, I dont like the smell. it's like living in a jungle. I dont wanna smell like jungle in the office. Who would? Nice bottle thou. That's all i can say. ""Yo dawg I heard you like figs. So I made a perfume with fig leaves, fig tree sap, fig fruit, and with pictures of figs on the bottle"".
If you've grown up near a fig tree like me, you've probably been told not to go very near the tree because the leaves and the figs can make your body incredibly itchy. Needless to say, I had my little misadventures near the lovely fig tree. Followed by a thorough scrubbing under the shower from my mother.
This is such a realistic and 1:1 recreation of fig that my body phantom pains the itchiness to itself when I put it on.
Personally it's not really my cup of tea. I'm not a fan of ultra natural smelling fragrances in general. But hey if the ""Yo dawg"" statement above applies to you, by all means go ahead and enjoy Philosykos! Very realistic fig scent. Opens very green and then turns sweeter smelling. Very fresh and enjoyable scent. Longevity and sillage are not impressive. I've tried both the EDT and the EDP. They smell the same to me and the EDP lasts a little longer and is a little more potent than the EDT. I probably will not purchase a full bottle because the performance is not that good. Womanity and Fresh Fig by Lauera Mercier are two other fig scents that I really like that have way better performance. Philosykos was my gateway into the world of niche perfumes. I don't know how diptyque does it but they manage to pull off the most organic, natural smelling scents. So far I've tried Eau Duelle, Do Son, and this.
This one is my favourite, such an interesting green scent. The opening is really fresh, you smell the woods and the leaves mostly. Then the drydown seeps in and it's all about jammy sweet fig with milky coconut. SO lovely and natural smelling you almost forget it's a perfume, I will definitely be grabbing a bottle in the near future. The best fig fragrance because it is actually not a straightforward fig fruit but rather a more earthy, woody fragrance. For me it is a smell of sand, some sun, some fruits. So calming and beautiful and very grounded. One of the best fragrances ever made. I have Premier Figuier which is sweeter, sharper and more like green unripe figs. I don't even think you can compare the two as they are in fact very different. If you think you've smelled the best green scents out there, try this.Probably the most realistic green scent you'll ever come across.
It literally smells like green leafs on a cold summer day. And not in a floral way either, just plain green leafs. So realistic that you smell like you just crushed some green leafs in your hands and rubbed it all over you. Will keep this short and sweet. 
Very green fig fragrance with a hint of woods in the background. Its linear and very simple. 
Performance - low sillage with moderate longevity. Hard to overspray this one or be cloying. Hard to see this offending. 
Verdict - Thumbs down for me. What I enjoy most is the slightly woody base coming through rather than its key player fig note. Although I like greens I dont like this take. For the price I would look elsewhere. 
Disappointing but I'm glad it was only a 5ml decant and not a full bottle purchase. I always thought this perfume was too sweet in the wrong way. So right now I layered it with eau duelle, which is sweet in the right way, and voila! Great mix of their 2 modern classics! Perfume is so much about memory. Different notes strike different chords and trigger different associations, linking past and present. 
For me, this fragrance is so discordant, two totally different scents, two totally different associations. Each by themselves interesting but together, like an orchestra out of tune. Maybe if you've spent time in a fig grove this scent makes sense to you, or is possibly even genius, but to me, I'm totally baffled. I've tried it three times now over the course of six months.
The top note is the problem to me. On one side we have the bitter smell of ripped leaves. I love ripped leaves -- it transports me to my youth, hiking through mossy damp forests, building forts out of large sticks, making clover bracelets, smelling a sweet dandelion, stumbling upon a random rhododendron bush, finding a wild blackberry bush and eating everything thats ripe. If you're not the hiking type, imagine ripping up arugula or kale and crushing it with your hands (but not so spicy), and then rubbing it all over your body. Ripped leaves range from sweet to bitter -- these are far on the bitter end. To go with that, I'd like some moss, some rose, some dirt, some pine, some salt and musk.
Not here. On the other side of this, we get a sweet blast that's like a coconut vanilla lollipop. Way too sweet, and maybe should match with pineapple, or lime, or something acidic. I eat figs, I like figs. I've eating a variety of figs in different countries around the Mediterranean, little figs and figs as big as apples. Good figs are like expensive honey, not like coconut. I do not get fig fruit at all. But whatever, fig, coconut -- whatever it is, it's just okay. 
But I cannot put these things together in my mind. Ripped bitter leaves and this sweet smell do not harmonize to me. Ripped leaves are so close to my heart, and the sweet note is like dumping corn syrup on the forest floor. Of course more people like corn syrup, but why would you ruin a beautiful forest smell with it? Like an out of tune children's orchestra hurts your ears, this top note hurts my nose. I wondered what the guy next to me on the commuter train was thinking, like, ""this person is insane.""
Two hours later it is settled enough to be inoffensive to me, so I won't wash it off. A very standard, powdery, slightly French die-down. 
I'm sorry, Philosykos, I want to understand you, but I can't! Next time I'm in a fig grove, I'll rip up some leaves and reconsider. (This review is for the EDT.) This perfume is very irritating to my nose, it smells just like nectarine/peach stones. It's as if I've just finished eating a nectarine - I keep feeling the urge to wash the smell off my hands. It's funny to see so many positive reviews of this perfume, crazy how our sense of smell can differ so extremely. Unfortunately, Philosykos was my introduction Diptyque perfumes; however on my next trip to the Liberty store I came across Eau Duelle and Do Son.. happy to say I love them and got FBs of both! Hallelujah. This became an instant signature fragrance the moment I smelled it! It's a realistic, naturally sweet and juicy fig scent with a hint of brown sugar and fresh cut grass or branches. I struggle with green notes sometimes, but the greenness in this one is so fresh, light and sweet, I just feel like 1 million bucks when I wear this. It's so refreshing for the summer, but there's a depth to it also that would make it perfect in fall and winter. So, good for all seasons if you ask me! 
I was lucky to get a generous sample of the EDT at Nordstrom's from the SA. I want it to be just slightly more substantial, so I'll be going for the EDP I think when I buy. This has become an instant staple in my collection - and I don't even have the full bottle yet!
I'm not sure this is a safe blind buy as the fig note is very specific, but I definitely recommend it as a must-try. It's incredibly beautiful and unique. Funny how we experience perfume so differently. It never fails to amaze me! I tested the EDT yesterday (no idea what took me so long, I know) and the first blast is very sweet and very coconutty. I was a bit surprised because based on the reviews I expected a more green and also a bit more ""bitter"" experience (along the lines of Un Jardin En Mediterranee). Granted, they both feature fig leaf but Hermes does not feature the fruit itself. 
However, this is a lovely, unusual summer perfume that's not overexposed and the coconut eventually does mellow out on me. But I cannot help but wonder if there is little Tuberose hidden somewhere. It's a sweet, fruity (realistic) fragrance that translates well from day to night and does capture that holiday essence. I don't get much wood though, completely lost with my BC. I still have a little left and will try it again when it's warmer. Unfortunately, this reads strongly green on me. I don't get any sweet juicy fig on my skin (which is what I was hoping it would be). Had to scrub it off.
Projection and longevity are excellent. Phylosykos is definitely a must-have, must-try fragrance of a green FIG-category (along with L'artisan Figue). Green, crushed-between-the-palms fig leaves, you can feel the juicines of the fruit...and it sooo perfect.
That being said, I must confess that the scent is very ""quiet"". It does not give me any explosions of emotions, it is just ..Comfort. The one that you would seek during loneliness, or ocean walk, or Sunday lazyness… I have the same feelings about Vetyverio. Because of that calmness, I wouldn't wear it every day.
Safe blind buy if you like green or fig frags. This perfume is gorgeous and unusual. The opening is lush and green. It reminds of freshly cut grass and leaves and rain. It dries down to a very green fig scent that is earthy in the best way. This perfume is not sweet and I often layer it with Diptyque Eau Rose for added complexity. Delicate green fig, airy notes, possibly other types branches and ferns... Nothing heavy or dark here. While I was reluctant to try fig scents after everybodys polarizing views on Womanity this is clean, natural and in no way offensive. I really am going to enjoy wearing my sample on sunny afternoons. I apologise for wasting space, here, with a non-review (again!), but I feel this is an important message in regard to counterfeit Diptyque fragrances. 
I’ve been duking it out with a seller in Russia because I noticed that they are currengtly selling brand new Diptyque items for next-to-nothing, and when I purused their multiple listings’ photos, I noticed that their Diptyque products were all made in TURKEY; ALL Diptyque is exclusively manufactured in FRANCE. These are very well-made counterfeits, but not Diptyque, and the way that people are bidding on these bottles, I’m afraid they’ll end up being re-listed by their buyers, on eBay, for a lot more than their purchase price. Sadly, this seller still has decent feedback, 99% of it from buying, not selling (I wish eBay would stop this practice of feedback for buyers..it’s ridiculous. “Seller paid for item that they purchased.” Yippee, 5-stars all around, for actually buying something you bought. Stupid false-validation, 5-star culture grumble grumble. Yeah. I’m peevish). Unfortunately, a lot of buyers won’t bother to look at detailed feedback, so blinded by low prices for a “new” Diptyque fragrance, and they also don’t bother to look at details beyond the boxes front, and the bottle’s label. Maybe some even know they’re counterfeit, but so desperate to own and display a boutique fragrance, they purchase it anyway. That good old Collection Envy. ugh.
PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT COUNTERFEITING! It compromises brand integrity, raises brand prices, and hurts sellers of genuine (and pricey!) fragrances.
(here she goes again, on her soapbox...get a personal blog, woman! *giggle*) After so many perfumes, and I mean thousands, this one is still one of the prettiest I have ever smelled. Its my top five. So beautiful creamy and well done. Smells like a happy sunny day outside in the best way ever! Gorge!!! I can't see what the big fuss about this one is about. I don't hate it, but it didn't seem to me it was worth all the hype; certainly, not the big price tag. Initial hit is grass (people say fig, i guess) and the dryout is fresh, a bit sweet and overall it is mild and all throughout it reminds you of fresh cut grass. 
My take, I wouldn't pay over 200 to smell like my freshly mowed back yard, Mind you, it is still pretty out there, the sun just rose and its first warming rays are caressing your pillow face,there are birds chirping, you can take a deep refreshing breath and feel confident and calm... unless you remember you just spent 200 bucks on a bottle of Phylosykos.... I tested this because I read it would be like Hermes Un Jardin in Mediteranee, which I love. I found that this was missing that green spicy bite that Hermes has...it's much smoother and I could see it appealing to a wider audience. It's distinctive but not quite interesting enough for me to buy in a bottle; it didn't do much after I put it on and faded within a few hours. Meh I love most fig scents, but I believe that while this is a quality scent, it is overrated. It is decent and a good scent for sure. But, it isn't the end-all like some say it is.
While it is a green fig scent, it isn't green from added green ingredients like Noble Fig or Figuier Eden. The green is the Fig tree and has an Ivy vibe similar to Ninfeo Mio by Goutal (but without the cat-pee vibe that Nifeo Mio has). It also isn't too overly coconutty like L'Artisan's offerings.
I think it is worth smelling and seeing if it is right for you! It is a quality scent, and is a good reference point for fig-based fragrance. 
But if you are just starting your fig journey here, there is a nice big world out there for you to enjoy. Don't let Philosykos be your final fig destination. I love fig notes. I love the contrast between the more milky and the greener facets of the perfume. It's subtle, with very little projection, but acts as a skin scent, gentle and inviting. The fragrance evokes an unripe fig, dripping with milky resin. Sweet but not quite edible. Quite natural, but tame and clean. I find it performs best in warm weather, the milky aspect is more pronounced with heat. Alright I have tested this so many times trying to come up with anything.
On me this is plant fig. It isnt the fruit. This is the plant. dry woody green. the coconut adds some smoothness but does not make it tropical at all. Its a very non fragrance fragrance. Like walking through a tree garden in summer. 
It is nice but just not me. I think I would like it more if it was a tiny bit more fruit forward. Or crunchy forward, like the fig seeds. 
Very nice fragrance though. Perfect for summer picnic type days. guys from Indonesia, trust me this one smells like Nasi Uduk. from malay, Nasi Lemak. For me, Philosykos is the life of a fig tree. The head notes are baby fig leaves. The heart brings in the young green fig fruit and the base is the fully mature fruit and wood of the fig tree. It is unique(to me) and lovely. Buy-ability rating: 8.5/10
This is brilliant. It’s so fresh but creamy, smells not like any other fig fragrance. It smells of green if that makes sense - the fig leaves and the trees.
One of very few scents to transport me to a place - I just get the Mediterranean, sat in a vineyard sipping wine overlooking the ocean.
The smell is divine.
Projection wise, it’s not going to grab the attention of people walking past outside if you’re layered up with a coat. However, if you stood a couple of places behind someone wearing this in a queue at a coffee shop, you might just smell it. 
I get decent longevity with it, although you might need a top up if you planned on wearing it for a full day at work for instance.
Not an evening night out scent. Definitely more of a warm weather scent (although I wear it in the office sometimes regardless of the time of year - it can be a great pick me up when it’s wet, cold and miserable outside!) . I also love to wear this just chilling st home. Anywhere really. But you wear this one for yourself rather than because you want others to smell how great you smell.
In summary: amazing smell, one of the best, not the strongest, but you wear it as an almost skin scent for yourself, decent longevity, not the most versatile as it is a warmer weather daytime fragrance predominantly, but could be worn in doors any time of the year, not overly pricey either for smaller bottles.
An 8.5/10 on the “buy-ability” scale. The smell is a 10/10. The price (and the slightly weak performance) knocks a point off the buy-ability scale though. So, after wearing this perfume for about a month, I am here to review the EDP.
This is a masterpiece. It is beautiful. I even bought a full bottle!
Philosykos (what a beautiful name) is fresh, green, juicy. I want to stress the wet aspect of it. This is really humid, juicy, watery - but not watered down! And I love all this dampness, it feels alive, it feels like it has just rained, and now it is sunny. The air is still humid, and you are under a couple of fig trees, water drops falling on your face from the leaves, while you eat a juicy, sweet fig alone and in peace.
The main notes that I smell, are those you can see above. A lot of fig leaf and tree, quite a bit of the sweet fruit with a milky and wet aspect. I don’t smell that much coconut actually. To me, it is the fig leaves that have that coconutty/herbal/slightly bitter feel. But it doesn’t remind me of coconut. 
This is really photorealistic fig tree/leaf and also fruit. If you have never smelled a fig tree, then take my word for it. This past summer I went to beautiful France (cote d'azur) and it was full of fig trees everywhere, so I learned their particular and unique smell.
The performance is good: longevity and projection are both moderate. This is a people pleaser that won't offend anyone ever. It is light but not a skin scent either! It can (and should!) be worn in the summer without choking you.
Comparison with the EDT:the EDT is wayy lighter (i.e. does not last 2 hours. I am sorry) and sweeter, but not in a sirupy way, it just has more of the fruit I think. The EDP has a way better performance, it's more wet, and it has a bit more of the bitterness of the leaf. I prefer the edp. Bought this blind based in these reviews on a flight back home to Australia.
Being a gardener my very first impression is the scent of a snapped twig, one from a plant full of sap. I'm at home already!
Drying down it exudes the aroma of fresh figs and cream and a mild coconut.
Divinely tropical. Very very realistic interpretation of fig tree, I'm so impressed! :D A green scent with a hint of warmth. The coconut note and drydown is giving me Creed VIW vibes. So good. 8.5/10 This is a true masterpiece, a realistic olfactory painting of a fig tree, where the ripe, juicy, and thirst quenching fruits are catching your eye first. Then you notice the amazingly green, shadowy leaves, and then the trunk and the bark of the tree, so realistic that you want to touch it. It is the authenticity of the smell of the bark that fascinates me the most. Unlike most of the green scents, which have translucent watercolour properties in them, Philosykos is definitely an oil painting. Like you're walking through Fig trees, mid August!
Actually there are a few big fig trees in our family olive tree field. 
The real thing. Mostly green than fruity, but perfectly balanced.
Sillage is moderate, longevity is moderate.

Overall: 6.8/10 The most realistic, ripe fig scent I've found. I grew up with fig trees in the back garden and with figs, both fresh and dried, being regularly devoured. This is not just the fresh fruit but the tree, the leaves, and the smell of it, gently warmed on a summer's day, spreading throughout the garden. The coconut is mild and keeps the fragrance fresh and fruity, complementing the fig nicely and tempering the woods to keep it all balanced. This is the only green scent I've ever been able to tolerate. Waw!! Great stuff. This smells so natural, those yummy figs that my dad devours everyday. Smells so natural, not too green, perfect amount of sweetness. I was recently offered Philosykos as trade for my bottle of Angel. Despite the notes not reading much like anything I currently wear, I decided to go for it based in part on its cult following, and also the fact that I just wanted Angel far, far away from me. 
I haven’t explored Diptyque before. I subconsciously associated the brand with the type of person who’d post a photo of themselves on social media in their impossibly white living room (furry throw rug optional), looking all faux casual and real smug, feigning deep thought with a caption about “self care” and “gratitude” and “being true to yourself” while they drink a $15 Moon Juice. 
Sorry, my issues are projecting themselves all over the place. Point is, this perfume ended up being a perfect example of something you expect to dislike becoming an instant love. 
Philosykos comes off so simplistic and clean, yet there is something deeply comfortable and reassuring about it. How can something be so crisp and creamy at the same time? Green, but a juicy, fragrant green that suggests both the tree and the fruit itself. This fragrance makes me feel very put together and approachable, and wears like an expensive cashmere cardigan over a cheap t-shirt and worn in pair of jeans. 
I guess this is my initiation into the cult of Diptyque. Something about this scent reminds me of wood sage n sea salt by jo malone the saltness of it mix with a touch of coconut It was love at first sniff. 
Creamy, green, fruity, summery, naughty, playful, smiling, fresh, young Greek island experience at any time of the year and for any (every) occasion. Be it for a ""Shirley Valentine"" or ""my funny Valentine"", this is pure unadulterated love, love, LOVE. 
A mastery of Olivia G., that is forever optimistically inclined with this recipe for love. Love at first smell. Yep, if I had to wear only one fragrance for the rest of my life, it would be this one. 
Imagine cold indian summer morning, sun is slowly rising, a woman is drinking her hot tea with coconut milk while looking at the sunrise through an open window, while cold breeze brings in the smell of freshly cut moist grass.
Now I don't know how fig leaf smells like, so the freshly cut grass is probably the fig leaf. Tea note is not present here, but the contrast of warm milky coconut and cold wet greenness is. As the sun rises and the smell evolves, it gets warmer. A masterpiece.
It's everything I never knew I wanted. Don't care that my mother thinks it smells like plucking weeds and my boyfriend says it's too coconutty. Intellectually, I'm impressed. It's a very green, very complex and interesting fragrance. The smell reminds me of many things, like peeling a branch of its bark. I like smelling it on paper but not on me.
The problem is, I don't particularly want to smell like a peeled stick.
But that's not a slam on this fragrance. It's incredibly well made. Philosykos is the perfect name for this composition. Friend of the fig tree, you are taken by the hand into a path this fragrance only knows and walks on, it’s lush, the fruit is ripe ready to be plucked, the path is short but sweet and you're more than happy to be led through again and again.
Philosykos, I understand viscerally how Diptyque contributed to the beautiful art form of Fragrance both through design and sense. This is beautiful, beautiful beautiful... Friend of the fig. Judging from the notes, the fragrance seems meant to embody the entire fig plant - from the soil to the wood to the fruit to the leaves, and even the dew on the leaves. I have never been around a fig tree (and probably never will) but I believe Giacobetti did an astute job of capturing the essence because I now believe I am having the full fig tree experience. 
The opening burst is all coconut, dew, and fig fruit to me. Did you know fig fruits aren't considered vegan because of the wasps inside? Quite a zing. The zing is apparent in the opening; what many would consider sharp and green, but rounded out by the sweet fruitiness. The coconut and the fig complement each other well; the coconut bolstering the creaminess of the fig. 
Heart-wise, I tend to wish that the woodiness in the back wasn't present. Overall, though, it adds to the fragrance feeling like an organic, natural fig tree experience. Again, I smell this without having experienced the fig tree. But I want to. The fig -- the sweetness and dewiness -- continue throughout the drydown. All of the ingredients seem extremely high quality. 
Overall, definitely worth experiencing and probably worth buying. I wear this on days that are warm and sunny and I am not feeling warm and sunny to make me feel warmer and sunnier. Very beautiful and realistic. It may not always be the most opulently dewy fragrance one wishes, but you'll always find it intriguing and refreshing. And it's just sweet enough. Kinda like Jeff Goldblum. For some reason the eau de toilette version is not listed on Fragrantica. This review is for the eau de parfum. At the opening I smell a strikingly realistic fig leaf; woody, green, leafy and vegetal. After about an hour fig and coconut become more prominent with a gentle woody backgound; maybe a hint of figgy sweetness. It may sound strange but at the opening I was reminded of a freshly plastered and painted room. 
Lasted about five hours with average performance. Philosykos is usnisex leaning feminine; for fall, spring and maybe summer; not especially sexy and fine for work. I enjoyed this scent quite a bit. It's pleasant and easy to wear all while using less common notes. I will admit the fig leaf was a little off putting at first but it doesn't stick around to long. The realism of this note is impressive. Philosykos is often referenced online as a model fig scent and I can understand why. Everything smells natural and high quality. I even like the bottle. It could perform a little better but it's not outrageously priced. Nice scent from Diptyque! This is a great summer scent. So fresh! If it was a colour - it would be green, fresh green. EDT does not last at all, that`s why I usually take the bottle in my bag. If anybody knows a similar but long-lasting perfume - give me a sign. This is a very pretty fragrance, when I can find the place where I sprayed it. It lingered on my blouse for maybe 5 hours, on my skin... a couple hours. I tried it a few times and the result is the same, boo, so I am disappointed. Absolutely gorgeous. Which would normally be intolerable. Why would I want to smell gorgeous. I don't want to Bogart gorgeous. My woman needs that scent palate. Unobstructed by me. 
But this is gorgeous as a hyperrealistic rendition of pure fig and coconut. Like something that tastes delicious. And gives me access to smelling gorgeous without the discord of not wearing a dress to go with it. 
So for that uniqueness in my collection. I'm very happy to have a bottle. I like to wear it to work out or to take a walk or for lounging around the house. 
It's very natural smelling. Mouthwatering. 
It doesn't last all that long. 4 hours on me. But for this type of scent I can just load up the sprays and it's never overpowering and I don't mind the shorter longevity. 
8.75/10 for me. A lovely niche player in my collection. philosykos is one i wish i could experience again for the first time. it was so different than anything i'd ever gravitated to up to that point, and i remember the moment i put it on feeling chic, in control, BEAUTIFUL-- but not intimidating or unapproachable. my introduction to the world of green scents, and my beloved fig leaf. the soft sweetness of coconut and fig fruit are blended seamlessly and serve as the pedestal holding the green notes up--it's all about that fig leaf ! dry down is a soft creamy cedar that still whispers green fantasies. it's been years since our introduction now, and i've never been without a bottle. launched in 1996 but everything about it still feels so modern to me -- philosykos is one of my touchstones. I don't get the delightful things other people are talking about here. I mostly get Johnson's Baby Shampoo. recently smelled it at Nordstorm and got its tested and now i am craving for it. its so sweet, cozy and homely. 
you cant get enough of it! trust me. 
the bottle screams luxury, so stunning. 
the lasting power of EDT is pretty impressive.
saving money to buy full size bottle :-D Reviewing the EdP version.
This is a juicy, buttery and delicious mixed scent of fig leaf and slightly unripe fig that makes you want to eat it. Seems very natural and authentic indeed. 
In the drydown it turns slightly woody with cedar or even sandalwood as a co-star. A little sweet as well, but not overly so in any way. Very green and totally unisex. A little too heavy for hot summer days, but perfect for slightly warmer spring or fall days. 
Sillage is moderate and longevity unfortunately not much better. Projects for 1 to 2 hours and the skin scent is completely gone after 4 hours. 
Excellent scent, shame about the longevity. - review for EDT
This one is sweeter and more fruitier than the EDP one (as i remember)
I want to mention something not mentioned yet in the reviews of this fragrance. In every fragrance's explanation on Diptyque's site, there is this ""olfactory accident"" expression - it is a term the house created and as i understand, this is the effect of what the perfume reminds of every now and then while sniffing. For this fragrance, black pepper is stated as an ""olfactory accident"", which i can totally agree but on my skin it is more like pink pepper or white pepper, without harshness of the black pepper. This is the effect appearing for the first half hour.
Afterwards, soft woody notes like sandalwood appears. And it leaves skin losing the green part and letting the soft woods play their role.
Yes, Jo Malone Wild Fig&Cassis is more about fig leaves and not-yet-ripened, green figs; its floral components make it much softer, well-rounded scent. But Diptyque has it own style and sharper appreciation of fig. When i smell Diptyque's, i think of the tree even with its roots, and Jo Malone makes me think of the little fruits in between fig leaves.
Today i also tried layering it with Byredo Blanche, they go well together, it becomes a clean and fruity green scent. The musk and florals in Blanche break the ""greeeeeen"" screaming effect of Philosykos. Also the pepper part combines really well.
(review of EDP will be coming soon) Lately I have been trying to appreciate the fragrances that I already own instead of giving in to the urge to continue to seek out holy grail scents, thereby draining my bank account.
So I recently reached for this beauty that I forgot about, sitting in the back of the fume fridge. Wow! It is worth all the hype it received back in the day.
Fig was a ground-breaking note a while back. This perfume is an original. Its a milky, green fig with a bit of sandalwood and coconut. I have the EDP and can't really comment on the ETP. This one performs awesomely for a fresh scent. I couldn't get over the compliments I received on this one. Most people who approached me said something to the effect of how different the fragrance was. All feedback was positive. I don't live for compliments, but I confess I enjoy getting them. 
I would highly recommend this unisex scent as a daytime casual, easy to wear fragrance. It is full bottle worthy and when this bottle is done, I will repurchase. 
Love it now more than ever. Conceptually brilliant! It's a masterpiece. 
I've literally never smelled anything as beautiful as this scent. It's my favourite and I treasure it. I never knew I loved the scent of fig until I bought this lovely perfume. It's creamy, green, woody and earthy. I love the coconut in this scent! The coconut gives it a summery vibe but I literally wear this scent all year round. I've got the EDT.
It lasts well enough on my skin and longer on clothes. For me, the scent is close to the skin but it's fine because I don't mind perfumes with low sillage. 
I will always love this perfume.
EDIT - I recently had the opportunity to sample the EDP, which is deeper, less herbal/green, and slightly sweeter than the the EDT. I really enjoyed it. 
I just had the opportunity to buy the EDP at a discount! I'm literally in heaven! I will treasure these perfumes for the rest of my life! + (Review for Eau de Parfum)
This is a really fantastic green fragrance that smells exactly like an unripe green banana peel. I was quite astonished and amazed at how evocative the scent of this fragrance is to a banana peel (not the banana itself, but the peel). Perhaps fig leaves smell like that? I actually don't get much fig at all in the fragrance. It's just very green smelling. Sillage is moderate (on the ligher side) while longevity is also moderate (nothing special).
4/5 Just received this in a swap and after a couple days of full wearings I must say I'm very impressed. Ive been thinning out my collection of Ouds and other heavier scents as I never have the occasion to wear them in the SW FL heat. Coconut has always been a favorite note of mine and this does it very well. The fig here to me smells more like a crushed leaf than the the fig itself. I do 5 sprays and though not incredibly potent i manage to get whiffs of it throughout the work day and even a compliment from a woman at 711. This is a must have if you're in a tropical environment and are looking for your go to. Highly recommended A gentle beauty, very pleasing tasty fragrance that doesn't barge into everyone else. I like the elegance of this house and so far this is my favourite. It does have a bit of a sun cream coconut thing going on but for me that just makes it very congruent with a lovely day. This is a good work or play scent and if I hadn't discovered Ex Voto and Dzing! maybe this could be a signature scent... But I did so it's not. My only wish is that it doesn't disappear completely but it really does. It's gone completely by the end of a working day.
EDIT: Altho this works well in the summer with it's suncreamy loveliness, it's wonderful and refreshing in cooler weather, and less predictable. Yum. This is gorgeous fig, of course, but for me it was a gentle, spicy cedar wood after that first hit of fig. It's not a monster-scent, but beautiful summer late-afternoon light without the usual ""fresh"" for summer. Nothing against fresh, but I like a little more bass in my music. Somehow, I kept thinking of sitting in front of a campfire. Nature, serenity, warmth on a cool evening. 
I have the feeling that this is one that would have men asking what you're wearing. Not unisex, exactly, but something a man would like on you. I fell in love with Philosykos while in London on holiday, more than 10 years ago, sniffing on a sample I got at Amsterdam's Skins (there is no better fragrance store in my opinion). It reminded me of the beaches of Herzliya, Israel. The smell of memories on sand as a child in one of the most beautiful places. 
I had to buy it, even though I wish I got some of the discontinued Diptyque fragrances that were still available at the time.
I find Philosykos to be complex, and it changes quite a lot. It can be fresh and light, and it can become somewhat heady and heavy in its own way. It is fruity but also woody, it has some sand notes and coconut, but I also always detect some metal notes in there that I like.
It stands the test of time, and manages to be better than Giacobetti's other fig concoctions becasue it is less straight forward and less linear. Beautiful and eternal. Philosykos is a three stage experience.
The opening is a green, sweet, and hyper-realistic aroma that will forcibly put you smack dab in the center of a lush wood; leaves on the ground beneath a canopy of branches, saturated in last night's rain. Every time I spray this I'm taken back to a single, otherwise untouchable moment of my childhood. It might not be your thing, but you'll probably love smelling it either way.
The second stage of Philosykos is delicious coconut, which is a smooth transition that still carries remnants of the initial opening. The smell of rich coconut draped in fig is heavenly.
The third and final stage of Philosykos is a disappearing act, and it comes too soon. Just like that, in the second or third hour, it's gone. Vanished without a trace. It is the only disappointing aspect of this fragrance for me.
Of course, that's the kind of problem that can remedied with more sprays, as I often do. It is a wonderful perfume packaged in a beautiful little bottle; a bottle that, if you enjoy the scent as much as I do, will end up draining way too fast for comfort. The scent of summer retreat in the tropic island.
Taking you to warm green villa in Bali, where time stands still. She is lounging on a day bed, sipping mojito, taking in the tranquility and calmness of this dreamy creamy coconut scent.... not having a care or a worry. So one of the most papular fig scent is Philosykos, I know. But really I think that Coconut is more remarkable. Philosykos start with so natural sense of fig leafs which I can remember my childhood time, when I tried for picking fig on tree. Sweet, strong & lovely coconut odor adds to it very soon. I really like this blend. Magic, special, green, fresh and excitant fragrance. At the end woody accord will appear with Aromatic vibe too. I have the toilette travel size & enough for my some spring days usage. There really should be two separate pages for Philosykos EDT and EDP - I feel they are not even siblings, maybe scent cousins.
I started with a sample of the EDT, in harsh mid-winter, and fell deeply in love with the scent as it transported me to green springtime. Even though I wasn't familiar, the sent threw me into a deep nostalgia for the 90s, with its green/fresh/minimalist character (sans calone). To me, the experience of applying this EDT is akin to burying your head in a pile of wet leaves, and I mean that in the best possible way. Unfortunately, the longevity and sillage on my skin were both atrocious - and my new bottle lasted for a month in bitter cold weather. 
I needed more, desperately. I glanced at a few reviews of the EDP, I kept seeing descriptions like ""more earthy,"" and ""less sweet,"" plus improved sillage and longevity. My bottle of the EDP arrived in mid spring. Not the same fragrance - and I don't think I've had the EDP long enough to fully appreciate it. I’ve only worn it 4 times in this warm weather. On me, it is ice cold, and there is a sharp, icy/freezer burn note that remains through the drydown. I would best describe it as a melancholy version of the EDT – darker and less green. If the EDT is a warm spring, the EDP is a bitter winter. However, the sillage and longevity are markedly improved – yet it’s far from a powerhouse. 
If you loved the EDT but want improved sillage and longevity, the EDP is an OK fix – but there are some definite differences. I would strongly suggest sampling both before buying. Philosykos EDP starts off with a sharp, fresh, green accord. It has a lush, wet vibe to it with an earthy element like a fig grove after a spring rainstorm. As it develops it becomes warmer, creamier, and the coconut comes to the fore. There is a little spice in the base and it lasts fairly well, but not a silage monster by a long way. This a spring and summer fragrance, and if you want a summer holiday fragrance that has coconut without being sweet then this might be the one for you. This one is for the EDT.
I'm so dissapointed because I don't get any single greeness what so ever!!! All I get is coconut. Coconut milk to be specific. Kind of like a coconut scented body lotion or something, but without the sweet vanilla note its often paired with. I don't really know what fig smells or taste like so I can't comment on that specific note whether it's evident or not.
I'm not sure if i'm anosmic to green notes or my skin doesn't pick up green notes in perfume, beacuse I had the same experience with L'ombre dans L'Eau (EDT).
I may test this again to verify because I can't belive what I'm smelling.
5/10 For EDT and EDP, I would prefer the first one. Compare to one is fresher, the other is warmer (both just a little bit, they're almost the same.) I favor Philosykos' refreshing opening more over the drydown. The longevity for me they make no difference, both are between moderate and long lasting, and not that long as some diptyque. Here price is the most important factor, for EDT 100ml is still far more not that expensive than EDP 75ml. 
I won't say DP's performance is good enough, still it's my salon signature, the after shower first choice.
Batch: 1177, 1367 made in france A great fresh,clean, just got out of the shower scent. If you like the TRESemme Botanique coconut milk & aloe products you'll like Philosykos. TOO ""green"" and smells almost like ""pot""/""weed"" on my wrist :))) because of the UNBALANCED ratio between the ripe fig VERSUS fig leaves, fig tree, green notes and coconut. Many people told me that green fig can smell like marijuana. I did not believe until I actually experienced it myself. The large percentage of fig leaves, fig tree, green notes and coconut in here actually takes away the sweetness of fig itself and turns this juice into something VERY ""green"", ""aromatic"" and rather ""herbal"" to my nose, which is a big NO for me :) It actually reminded me more of Victoria's Secret Bombshell In Paradise.
I LOVE the fig in Jo Malone Wild Fig & Cassis Cologne the best! And this one does NOT even come close to that discontinued ""legend""! The fig leaf in the discontinued Victoria's Secret Dream Angels Halo EDP is also very feminine and fresh (with soft, gentle, and non-offensive green notes). I would buy full size bottle and wear it every day, if it had a bit more longevity. It disappeares completely after hour - hour and a half. Fragrance is very pleasant, comfortable and warm. I love to wear this while driving my 1998 Volvo V70 wagon. Thanks Olivia Giacobetti! The third Dyptique I am trying these few days and the third ""miss"" for me. Another green one, sharp and kind of generic. Too bad. I ended up with a full bottle of Do Son EDP kind of by accident and I think luckily it is the one I like the most, the fourth one I tried. I am a bit disappointed. I always wanted some Dyptique because it looked kind of exclusive and niche and I like label designs but when I finally got to serious thinking of trying and buying, it won't be happening. Another one reminding me of Issey Myaki Scent and Bvlgari Eau Fraiche. I have Balmain Vent Vert, I think that's enough for this type of green. Once in a while I miss where I originally came from and look for fragrances to remind and comfort me. Scents that bring me back to the house I was born surrounded by different types of flowers such as Roses, Carnations and others and also various juicy citrus fruits, pears, pomegranates, peaches and apricots and various herbs and vegetables (like Mom´s tomato plants whose leaves smelled so good). 3 giant and glorious Fig Trees were there too. The bliss of earth´s natural fragrances. 
Philosykos Diptyque captures about 30% of what a real Fig leaf and Fig fruit smell like. I know it in my heart. This is not a real fig fragrance in its entirety. This synthetic product definitely hints around its advertised theme but is far from it. Spring is almost here and this is the perfect fragrance to usher it in. Philosykos feels like a day when you get up early and go outdoors where everything is fresh and clean and new. Walking in the park and smelling green buds poking out their little heads and having a brighter outlook on life. Diptyque is probably one of my favorite niche houses. Philosikos (EDP) was my second fragrance from the house and at first I didn’t love it. It seemed a little thick, but fleeting. I was wrong, pleasantly so. 
This opens so green, like the leaves of the fig tree, but soon develops into the fruit along with some coconut. It is rich and lasts a long time. I get whiffs of it all day when I wear it. I feel like it sits close to the skin, but I like that with a scent like this. 
All in all I think this is a great Spring scent. Get a fig tree leaf. Crush it. Smell it. You have Philosykos. I don't mean this in a bad way. Fig tree leaf smells nice and green :)
Sadly I get no actual fig fruit. No coconuty vibe either I am obsessed with Philosykos. The few times in the past when it has been recommended to me, it never quite caught on —- I think because I couldn’t get past the super green opening notes. It always smelled too herbal or leaf-like. 
However, when I tested a sample recently of the EDT, I fell in love. It really warms up on the skin and just blooms. There is a fresh fig, with a milky (lactonic?) quality about it that is just so soothing. As others have noted, it does also have a coconut smell to it — not like a pina colada, but like fresh coconut. It is just so fresh — and makes me yearn for spring and summer. 
There is a resemblance to Marc Jacob’s Men, but the MJ has a somewhat synthetic, cloying quality that Philosykos does not have. 
My only complaint is the lasting power is not too long when sprayed on skin, so I actually just purchased the EDP, and will give that a go as well. 
Perfect for all occasions. Love!
ETA: I love the EDP even more! It is less “green” and a little warmer — just perfect for the tail end of winter. Love it! I tried tonnes of fig perfumes, mostly because I love fig fruit, especially when it comes freshly from the tree. I know how it smells. Before I get Diptyque Philosykos, I thought ""This will be the next horrible, non-fig smelling fig scent"", but you know what happend? First time I felt the fresh ripe fig, exactly that one I love to eat from the figtree. After I sprayed I smelled grass, or crash leaves, it was very green, and I smelled fig and coconut. After 15 minutes I feel the fresh fig, less green and less coconut. Its a beautiful composition, a positive disappointment. My new love. Now I understand why many people love it! I love this. Such a comforting, earthy, warm fig. For some reason it just feels right to wear this when looking for treasures at antique/thrift stores..:-). To me it’s a scent to enjoy for oneself. I’ve yet to come across any guy who thought this one was very sexy. (Which is fine....I mean, who needs to be sexy all of the time). Lasts a reasonably long time on my skin. While sampling the EDP today my girlfriend pointed out that it smells like a balloon. A fancy balloon, but a balloon nonetheless. If I had to succinctly describe this fragrance, I would say that it is the scent of fig tree leaves and branches - bright, woody, green. It does not gender signal at all in the usual and lazy way most mainstream fragrances do. That is to say Philosykos doesn't resort to one of a handful of familiar aromachemical combinations that one would associate specifically with male or female marketed fragrances in order to reassure you that you are in the correct gender aisle at Sephora. It is unisex. Whether you find fig tree leaves and branches to be masculine or feminine is entirely on you.
In my opinion, Olivia Giacobetti's particular magic is found in her ""green nature"" creations - fragrances which evoke dewy leaves and grasses, woods, earth, and water... without dunking them in a muddle of perfume-y affectations. She finds a way to make ""nature"" wearable. Philosykos, along with Preparation Parfumee Andree Putman, are really top notch examples of such work. @jamie-37 Let me try to answer your questions. 
Is it too hippie? - No. Just a little. :)
Is it an ‘80s smell? - No.
Is it masculine? - No. I’m a woman and I happily wear it.
Is it a loud citrusy cologne-type scent? - No.
Is this perfume sharp? - Only in the first 5 minutes.
Is it loud? - Only if you overspray.
Is it heavy? - Absolutely not.
Is it light? - Hmmm not exactly. 
Is it balanced? - Yes.
Is it warm? - No, it’s rather cold(ish) but very pleasant. 
Is it soapy? - No.
Is it tart citrus? - No.
Is it sweet sugary like kool aid? - No.
Hope this helps! Blind Buy.
I got it recommended by a friend to try it out. Came to this page, saw people said it is similar to the ""The Italian Fig"", went to my local Body Shop and smelled it. I liked the smell of it on my skin but was not entirely sold. The next day I see a Philosykoks EDP on sale and said to myself that it might be a big upgrade so I did not know what to expect from it. I directly go with a blind buy because of the good price and good reviews here, I spray a bit on my neck and scarf. 
The scent disappeared after only one hour. Was a bit sad but I said maybe because of the cold weather outside. Once I got home sprayed before sleep and disappointed to say that the scent disappeared more quickly than I fell asleep. 
Tried again in the morning before work. Got only one hour out of it. I like the scent, it gives the feeling of ""rustic"" and takes back you back to a place where time stands still and the sun burns with passion. But the performance is very low on my skin and even clothes. Sillage is very soft on my skin and performance under one hour. Would not recommend for blind buy or for those who would like to stand a bit more out of the crowd. Keep this one for personal uses around the house or gardening. The most authentic and beautiful fig in perfume. Perfume is light, green and very fig. I spend it on hot summer days. Yes, certainly not everyone will love it, not everyone will like it, but with this brand it is not the goal. The coolest think about this is how starkly realistic it smells.
Because of that the previous reviewer said it's not very wearable.
That's a good question. I think it's more wearable and enjoyable for men perhaps.
L'Artisan Parfumers makes the most creamiest fig that leans feminine by B. Duchaufour, it's called Caligna I believe.
My review is further below. This has a lot of fig wood smell, and a nuance of coconut softens the stark dry greeness of Philosykos. It's just a good refreshing smell for me.
Diptyque has become my favorite house recently, I'v gotten to know most of their fragrances.
Philosykos is one where it's very worthwhile to get the EDP. The scent is about the same with edt, but longevity is frustratingly short. EDP longevity is solid.
L'Ombre Dans Lieu, I highly recommend edt vs edp, allso for Volutes. I love how green and fresh this perfume is. I'm genuinely impressed by the ability to capture the smell of a green fig. It reminds me of shopping at the farmers market and brushing up against a crate of figs at the outset of the season. 
That said, I enjoy the experience in a clinically interested way, as someone who loves to cook. I don't want to smell like this. I spent 2 weeks in the Abruzzo region of Italy this summer, visiting family. Everyone was feeding us figs (white/green and purple/red), there were too many to eat. We were in heaven and wished we could take them home --- good figs are super expensive where I live. There were bowls of cold figs in my aunt's refrigerator every morning. An older man came up to me and told me that he was my 2nd cousin, and he hadn't seen me in 20 years, and that he had figs to bring to us later. We were swimming in figs.
So imagine sniffing through the duty-free shop before flying back, sad to leave central Italy behind, and you casually pick up this little black solid perfume tin that is so much heavier than it looks...and you open it and packed inside are bushels (that's why the tin is so heavy!) of fresh and almost-ripe but still-a-bit-green figs. So I was able to take the figs home after all!
The coconut note is barely discernible to me and only serves to warm the scent a bit, or add a dash of cream to it. My only complaint -- this fragrance disappears too quickly. I got an EDP bottle of this and man do I love this fragrance. I don't know much about figs so I can't comment on how close it is to the actual thing. Initially, I get the burst of green when spraying it in which a bit too quickly turn into sweet creamy coconut smell. I was expecting this to be fresher and woody but what I get didn't disappoint me at all. Definitely unique fragrance to add to my collection, the drydown is absolutely lovely.
And as everyone probably mentioned my only complain is the longetivity of this frag. My skin naturally eats up scent but this one only last about an hour then it's completely gone. I love this perfume, and it seems to suit my skin chemistry well. People frequently tell me my perfume is ""lovely"" when I wear this.
I don't tend to like overly sweet perfumes. This has a clean fresh scent, with sunny green leafy notes, that glide over a nutty and buttery undergrowth - which the woods and coconut add to the blend. I was surprised to see coconut listed, as I didn't quite pick it up the first few times I wore it - but it's understated and works so well with the other elements of the fragrance.
A gloriously and curiously harmonic perfume. Philosikos EDT
Fresh green notes ( fig leaf ) with hints of creamy coconut 
Unique fresh scent . Excellent replication of fig. It's not overly sweet, but smells like the leaves, bark ,and less ripe fruit. 
Definitely unique, very fresh and should be tried if you're into non generic perfumes. I don't think you can even compare Philosykos to LP's fig perfumes. I really dislike what Olivia Giacobetti has created for them, I find them to be cloying and unpleasant. Philosykos is on a different level. What can I say about a two decade old classic that still remains very popular and continues to attract admirers in drones? A trendsetter of modern niche perfumery, this is the one that first said its okay to smell like grass laden fields and tropical palms. A lovely unisex composition comprising of a primary note of fig leaf and fig milk, the fragrance is enhanced by addition of coconut, cedar, and woody notes. Simple in concept and execution, yet boundary pushing in so many ways. This is a fragrance that defines modern perfumery of scents taking you to a place and time, without necessarily having to be laden with aromatic elements. Very haunting and very unique even in 2017, 21 years after it was first introduced, this is truly an example of modern artistic and abstract brilliance. I put this into my top 5 for early Autumn.
I have tried all the popular figs on the market. Why I like this the most is that it smells least like a fragrance, and most natural.
I have a large collection, and wear fragrances maybe too often, to where you start to get tired of them, and they become more unimpressive.
This has a refreshing anti-perfume effect for me. It's transportive to where I feel I'm in the woods and just peeled the green bark from a fig tree and put my nose in it, wonderfull!
Rating: 9/10
God bless. John 3:16 I almost didn't try this because I am not normally a fan of fig fragrances: they can be too sweet, heavy, juicy. But this is wonderful, evoking fresh green leaves as well as fruit. Likewise, coconut can be too tropical--pina coladas and suntan lotion--but this is to that as coconut water is to Coco Lopez cream of coconut, if that makes sense: light and refreshing rather than cloying. On me this starts out quite aquatic, and then the fig and coconut start to emerge, but it remains fresh and green. The wood is subtle, adding just a slight warmth--I guess it completes the fig tree. Overall, a wonderful surprise and I especially love how it evolves. Guess I am a fig fan after all! I can't believe this fragrance came out in the 90s. When I think of the 90s, I think of Cool Water, CK One. Or the other end of the spectrum, Angel --- that sort of thing. This has aged really well. It's just so beautiful and comforting. It's not obnoxious. It might be shy and quiet, even. There's a time for loud perfumes, and quiet ones. This smells a lot like Starfruit juice to my nose with Coconut coming in the mid-phase. Certainly different from the fig that I smell from Vetiver fatal which gets my vote over this. Philosykos defined my taste for fig perfume.The key word is ""dewy"".
I was comparing philosykos and Cassis&wild fig (by Jo Malone) hand by hand. 
I noticed a subtle calone note at the top of philosykos, whereas the Jo Malone's creation has a much more milky sweet blast at beginning. In fact, that airy calone stays on, lightening up the whole perfume.
The body of philosykos is green and...aquatic, it's almost ethereal compared with the aromatic, even balsamic undertone of Cassis&wild fig. Also there was a nail-polish-remover vibe in the whole Cassis&wild fig. I have Philosykos in both the EDP and the EDT. The EDP is strong, heavy fig, with more waxy coconut; I find the EDP somewhat oppressive especially in the first hour, but it may be just right for someone whose skin eats fragrance. The EDT is more watery in a good way and emphasizes the juiciness of the fig. I prefer the refinement of the EDT, at least on myself. Philosykos is one of my top favorites August through October. I live in southern Texas and at least half of the wild plants that grow in my neighboring greenbelt are sharp and ugly. The other half are partially dead from the drought and heat. Exaggerating, but it seems nature is telling me not to live here. 
Imagine my surprise. I was getting rid of some brush when I started faintly smelling a very real Philosykos wafting through. There was no one around me and I highly doubt my neighbors walk around wearing Diptyque. I kept smelling the air and discovered that not 10 feet in front of me was an extremely parched fig tree - small tiny green fruit with yellowing leaves. 
Let me tell you: crushing those fig leaves creates a smell almost exactly like Philosykos except a little more sharp, a little less sweet, and a little more green. Beautiful, this was already one of my favorite scents even before I encountered a fig tree in real life but now I appreciate it even more! 
Great job Diptyque! Diptyque Philosykos is basically the smell of figs and I can not smell nay other notes in it. Yes I love the smell of fig tree while travelling in Sicily or south of France, eating them I have there better fruit to devour, but do I feel like wearing it? No. It is very sweet. And rather flat smell. It didn't hit my spot. But I understand why it would work for many people, it is as I said really fig-y smell. I don't know enough technique to tell what exactly it is, but this perfume get's to a point that is refined art. Much more than a good smell, and (to my taste), a lot better than than rest of fig scents, and certainly an improvement on Premier Figuier. In this sense, not considering performance, Olivia Giacobetti is my favourite perfumer by far, being En Passant another amazing example. Bottled magic. :) A strange comforting smell. Especially when the smoke comes in and melds with the other ingredients. Not for everyone. DO NOT BLIND BUY even though this one is incredibly popular! I would buy this if the coconut note wouldn't be so strong. I can barely smell the fig, because the coconut takes over after 1 minute or two. However, I find this is the most natural smelling coconut note I ever found in a fragrance, not like those synthetic exotic coconutty summer fragrances you can find everywhere Philosykos is a wonderful evocation of a fig tree in full bloom - the bitter green leaves, the ripe milky fruit, and the sappy, woody twigs and bark.
At first, I was put off by the coconut - a note that is quite prominent to my nose, primarily because it's not one I tend to enjoy. It all made sense after testing Diptyque's Figuier room spray, however. Figuier is a much drier, woodier, and more austere scent to my nose, lacking a good deal of the lushness that makes Philosykos so beautiful. A lot of that comes down to the creaminess of Philosykos' coconut note, which evokes both sap and plump figs on a branch. It's an utterly necessary part of this beguiling scent.
The EDT projects lightly and has moderate longevity. I haven't tried the EDP so can't speak for its scent or performance.
Overall, Philosykos is a perfectly balanced, very natural-smelling scent of subtle beauty which is eminently wearable. Very Diptyque, and very, very good.
I'll leave you with some fun fig-related facts:
• Figs aren't actually fruits - they're blossoms turned in on themselves, which are pollinated by wasps that burrow inside to lay their eggs
• There are dozens of different fig species, many of which boast their own species of fig wasp
• Philosykos seemingly sparked a late 1990s trend for fig scents, my favourite of which is Dior's strange, shimmering woody-aquatic Dune Pour Homme One of the perfect scents for Spring and Summer! Received a free sample. Initial smell is like fesh cut grass, then turns into a kind of milky fragrance. Not a fan of this and combined with low sillage and longevity, I am not buying a bottle. What the drydown overwhelmingly smells like to me....coconut?
I have this in the travel size. The scent is very put together and elegantly mixed, a modern classic if you will. However, I'm not sure if this is what I would want to smell like or would care that others smell like. This is not a scent for me to show my personality. Rather, this is a scent that I think I'd wear for myself to escape from reality.
Despite the green scent that comes from the smell of fig in the first 3 minutes, I would classify this as an early spring / fall / rainy day scent. Although the scent easily reminds me of being on an island with its heat, it also smells very dry just like it. So it doesn't blend well with wearing it in the summer. 
The coconut is what I smell most which layers on top of fig, which I really like as I love the smell of coconut. It is not a light, fresh coconut but one that is more dense and milky and even oily. Philosykos is all about the smell of summer air in Greece. 
Philosykos has become one of the most special fragrances for me. As an absolute lover of Greece, this year again I spent my holidays on the Greek South Aegean Dodecanese islands. 
Travelled around three islands and this perfume will always remind me of the smells of Greece: hot air, the sea and meltemi wind, tropical flowers, different herbs and low bushes growing on the hills close to the sea, the beautiful smell of the thyme, olive trees and fig trees which grow everywhere. Philosykos is the most realistic smell of the fig tree ever and wearing it I feel as if I were in Greece again. My memory of the special time in Greece - one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen and been to: beautiful people, hospitality, amazing landscapes, unbelievable smells. Greece is my Paradise. Philosykos captures it in a divine way. I am not sure about this one. I never smelled fresh figs, so I have no idea how close this is, but the opening is not it's strongest point. It opens very green and sharp....dry grassy, herbal dryness, not unpleasant....but definitely not pleasant! And then it develops into a more creamy, lovely, clean scent, but still with a clear presence of ""green"". For me it works better sprayed on my clothes, and I almost bought it, but after testing it on my skin 10 times and hoping it will grow on me....it never did. Too sweet and tropical for my taste, maybe it's the coconut idk.. Hoped it would be woody. This is so deliciously bursting green and fresh, like sniffing a freshly opened fig and torn fig leaves. The EDP lasts and lasts, not too strong. Just what I want for a hot day. Love, want. sweetened frig leaf. i like leaf notes ithought i could like this one too but no something is wrong At the Springtime of LIfe

8,Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016," My bottle of Jessica Simpson Fancy Nights went bad, so I bought a replacement only to discover that it too, had turned. I then decided to stop messing around with Fancy Nights altogether because it's out of production and seemingly impossible to find a fresh bottle online. Instead I bought Coromandel and I couldn't be happier. It's everything I needed from Fancy Nights only fancier, lol! This isn't a serious review but I do think this is a great, multifaceted and thoroughly enjoyable, classy substitute, and it has a sparkling shape shifting character so sometimes it's white chocolate, sometimes patchouli, sometimes rose, wood, or musk... It's really well blended but sometimes individual things flicker momentarily in the light like a dark opal. Thanks for going bad, Fancy Nights! You nudged me in the right direction! This is so beautiful and I am not a huge lover of patchouli. It's blended so wonderfully, yet it is complex with different nuances weaving in and out throughout the wear. You get citrus, you get creaminess, you get earthy touches, and so much more. Great fragrance! Dior Patchouli Imperial (2018) vs Chanel Coromandel EDP (2016):
Dior opens up with a wet, cold mold - semi-dry one. Then it slowly sweetens up with tonka bean and amber.
Chanel opens up with a mix of aldehydes (a lot of them), flowers and a pinch of white chocolate (hidden far behind). I cannot smell any singular flower (rose per se or any other). This dries down into patchouli (rather not raw, but not very mild on the other hand) - sweet, cozy and warming; resins and incense (this is in the background but is detectable). The patchouli here gives you chocolate'y vibe so all combined together might smell for some like there is a milk chocolate with cocoa.
In general - Dior is simpler, but its patchouli in general is more ""in your face"" and it is straight patchouli. Chanel is more sophisticated and much more complex.
If you want patchouli as its essence - choose Dior. If you want a more complex variation - choose Chanel. Went to a Chanel boutique and checked out my darling Coromandel, the juice is much lighter than the 2016 first EDP issuance, I still have the 2016 and I'm concerned if the performance has been diluted just like the juice appears to be, I'll probably end up buying the newer lighter juice anyway and cherish what is remaining from the 2016 older bottle. disappointed. What a stunner Coromandel is. So very unisex. If you love patchouli you are in for a treat with this beautiful citrus amber scent..it's full of decadence. It's rich, sophisticated. It's full bodied and dense. Adding the special touch of white chocolate with incense makes it a beautiful gourmand treat done in the best possible way. This is not only a must try but a must buy. It's one of the most beloved fragrances made by Chanel and well known by the community for good reason. It takes you on a journey wanting more and everyone around you will feel the same. Get ready to splurge on this one..don't even try to fight it it's inevitable you two will eventually meet and remain together forever lol. Creamy and earthy and smoky, oh my. Coromandel is warm and enveloping, beautifully out of reach but friendly. The heavy dose of patchouli gives this almost an artsy touch: this is the scent of your elegant but quirky aunt whose house is filled with objects collected during her travels. 
In the late stages of the drydown, the patchouli mostly has disappeared and I am left with a lot of white chocolate and benzoin. At that point I do miss some depth, which I why I'll probably make do with the decant I have, but the first five hours are magic. If anyone had asked me which of the Les Exclusifs I would enjoy the most before trying any of them, I would have used Misia, which I do like, but find a bit too rooty and carrot-like to be a love. Because of the large patch note, Coromandel would have been near the bottom of the list. I haven't sampled all of the Les Exclusifs, but I have tried a majority of them, and hands down, Coromandel is my favorite.
I am not sure what alchemy they use to make me fall so deeply in love with a fragrance so loaded with patchouli, but even though it's there and I can clearly smell it, it must be the combination of other notes, especially the incense, oil barnum, benzoin, and the touch of white chocolate that transform this into a supremely elegant and sophisticated perfume, that a full bottle is in my future.
In the meantime, I will have to satisfy my desire for Coromandel with the 4 ml mini, the generous decant I received from darling Ana, and the lot of 12 carded samples I just purchased. I consider this to be a masterpiece, and while there are some who may find the former EDT to be superior, I really don't see how there is room for much improvement! Coromandel opens so nicely, and I thought I had found a keeper. Alas no, in about 1 minute it turns scanky and musty. Dirty smelling. Someone below said it smells like rotten, damp wood, and yes, is does. If I could find this frag minus that scank it would be full bottle worthy because that creamy white chocolate is just dreamy. Such a shame. Coromandel is a perfume that has the most beautiful opening and lasts beautifully maybe half an hour (beautiful white chocolate), unfortunately later it turns into the smell of a moldy basement (probably dirty, earthy patchouli with benzoin).
I give Coromandel a lot of chances but we didn't find each other, that mold (moldy) bothered me a lot. 
Many people love Coromandel, weird and heavy and that is why it is very attractive to perfume enthusiasts.
Very interesting, while wearing Coromandel I got a lot of compliments.
But there were also negative comments - ""that something stinks of mold"".
The performance is outstanding.
I see that many compare Coromandel with Xerjoff Richwood, these are completely different perfumes that have no similarities.
People rely more on the pyramid of notes than on their own nose.
Often perfumes have the same ingredients but smell completely different.
5/10 I got a sample from chanel and I was trying to figure what it smells like. I just realized, it smells like the incense they light in a Thai temple when you're praying for something. If not that, then one of those essential oil or incense sticks they sell in Asia. It's a unique and odd smell. I can't imagine myself wearing it and I can't really figure out who would wear this and in what situation. When I first sprayed this, for a few seconds I thought I'd found my signature scent. It was just beautiful. But this beauty lasted for no more than a few seconds. Then suddenly a strange smell emerged that was both familiar and elusive. Maybe it was the patchouli, I'm not sure. It smelled slightly musky, slightly plasticky, at times almost like paraffin. This effect came and went in waves but each successive wave was more potent and less pleasant. At one point, my son came into the room and said, ""Why does it smell of poo in here?"" It does have a somewhat earthy smell, but I'm not sure that was what troubled me. 
It went on like that for hours: pleasant, rich florals and creamy sweetness interspersed with spikes of that peculiar, plasticky musk. I still don't know what to make of this, but it's clearly not for me. Reminds me so much of my dad pouring on the Obsession when I was a kid. And my aunt’s obsession for women. That’s what I get from Coromandel. To my nose-mind the memories of those overshadows... 
I wore it all day and night to give it a good try. And it lasts amazingly well. Just one spray and it dominated all day and night. I did have to wash it off that evening to get away! There’s a classier, more expensiveness to it, but the obsession...can’t do it! lol This is a very, very interesting fragrance, complex with a multi-fold character. And has a slow development, in the sense that it unfolds many sides of its personality during the time you wear it. And therefore, can match many different tastes.
It starts off aldheidic to me, and right after warm and spicy – I can smell some cinnamon, cardamom also something like pepper or nutmeg? But these spices are “clean”, not so much like the ones you would put in food while cooking. It also has a fresh, almost balsamic note that reminds me of juniper or better sniffed, cedar. 
The heart is powdery (iris) and flowery and then there is the patchouli note. I instantly got the same effect as in Voleur de Roses…. Earthy, moist, rotten wood…. Like in wine cellars. The moist cellar note is prominent. That's the green side of patchouli and the rotten side can be disturbing to some.
In Coromandel this mossy moisty hearthy note is not so stingy and pungent (in Voleur de Roses was unbearable to me, had to wash it off).
The combination of the spices, lingering all along the development, are mixing so well with this mossy wooden note that makes me sniffing and sniffing again my hand... it is really gorgeous and such a combination I would love and applause on a man. 
Does somebody remember the very first Versace L'Homme (the one w/the tan box and black/silver lettering)?? Well, Coromandel has a very similar connotation in the drydown, for the spices, the mossy/earthy/patchouli note.
To me Coromandel is rather a masculine fragrance, although a lady can wear this as well. 
It has also a sort of animalic attraction, that makes it very sexy, in a subtle, unscreamed way. 
A masterpiece fragrance, with a huge personality and loads of sophistication. 
PS: in no way this is close to Prada (amber). I have Coromandel Edp that I got for Valentines's day. And Fancy Nights... which is a favorite of mine. I'll dodge the stones heading my way. But Fancy nights is stronger. Darker. And sweeter. Coromandel is lighter. More complex and smells like a symphony of notes. Whereas in Fancy, I smell a one note hammer bonking me in the head. But Fancy is strong and I like it. My boyfriend thinks Fancy Nights smells like a dentist's office. He prefers Coromandel. He thinks Coromandel is smooth while Fancy Nights is screechy. Yes. And Yes. But I like both. I prefer Coromandel when I'm dressed up, wanting top shelf drinks. Fancy Nights is for when I wanna cozy mixed drink. Bottom shelf. Cause this late in the night. No one cares, or is sober enough to remember. But If anyone asks, I'm wearing Coromandel I received a sample from a fellow perfumista friend here. Thanks Elisabeth! For the longest time I was very curious about this scent and what all the hype was about, but I wasn't in a rush to get a sample, mainly because I'm not a big fan of patchouli. Still, looking at the other notes, I was very intrigued. As soon as I applied it after my shower last night it hit me that I know this fragrance. Either someone I know wears this, but I can't think of who, or there is another perfume that reminds me of this, but I can't think of what. Of course, I'll probably remember right after I finish this review. LOL. 
Anyway, this is a dense, chewy fragrance where the strongest notes to my nose are the sweet creamy white chocolate, a vanilla tinged amber, and an earthy, slightly mentholated patchouli. My immediate reaction on smelling the patchouli was that I was grateful it wasn't that hippy patchouli so common during my youth, otherwise it would have been an immediate NO for me. 
Right after the opening salvo of bright citrus and neroli top notes, it quickly evolves into this delicious, sweet, slightly aromatic, musky concoction. I am barely picking up any floral notes, aside from the very clear neroli opening, and only getting a light incense on the dry down. Otherwise, there's not much evolution, but that's okay because this is nice and cozy as is. There's something very comforting about this fragrance that gives me the urge to relax and unwind. 
Silage is not overwhelming, but very present, and longevity excellent. I woke up this morning with the scent still going strong. A big plus and somewhat of an anomaly for Chanel perfumes. I don't know whether I'll purchase a fb or not, but I still have a few wears left in this sample that will give me time to decide. But as of right now, I really, really, like it. 
Oh, I just remembered the perfume, actually two, this reminds me of. Elie Saab's Le Parfum Intense. Both share the same earthy, mentholated patchouli note, but in Coromandel it is much tamer. Also Shalimar Extrait. The amber vanilla base smells almost identical to me.
Edit - reading through all the reviews and someone mentioned Prada Amber. Yes, I also think this shares a similar earthy patchouli note, though it is not aromatic in Prada. Wow. I actually like this better than the EDT. It's CREAMIER. Like the cream on a red velvet cupcake. And it lasts forever. I actually woke up in the middle of the night, sleeping with my wrist near my nose, and smelled it. It has been at least 9 hours since I tried this on. I'm actually typing this from bed.
Going back in the morning to get it. 
Makes me wanna write a book with an old typewriter, in big brown glasses, a soft blouse, and my favorite little yellow-gold earings. Sipping a strong Black tea with sugar, or a deep Red Wine. ♡
I LOVE. I got a (hopefully) legit sample off Ebay-I wanted it to try after all the glowing reviews it has. Unfortunately to my nose it smells like a dusty, earthy (probably the patchouli?) perfume with the tiniest bit of incense. No white chocolate, no expensive ""money"" smell or any of the other notes. The dusty smell I get reminds me quite a bit of Elle by YSL, but in Elle it is in much smaller doses. Lasted more than 6 hours on my skin and days on clothes, so the quality is definitely there! I just whish I got the amazing white chocolate scent everyone else seems to get :(. For the price it is probably better for my bank account that I don't like it. I think this is a masterpiece, whoever wants to smell rich, exquisite, and unique should buy this! 
very classy, very attractive, maybe not the most feminine scent, but suits a vigorous woman!
it's a top-notch perfume, I'm glad I have it...
Uniqueness: 9/10
would I buy it again? yes! Patchouli heavy with wood, sweet incense and a hint of amber. These are the only four notes I can sense in this perfume. It's well blended but sickly and I am really not keen on it. Leans more masculine. It’s a love from me for this fragrance. I mostly get a dominant patchouli note which has a perfect very very gentle and soft wet soil note which blends with the other notes perfectly. The neroli and bitter orange add a cleanliness to the scent while the resins, mainly the benzoin provide a vanilla-like sweetness. I also smell a powdery rose along with these notes. To me those are the most obvious notes and add up to an amazing fragrance. It’s very sophisticated with a ton of depth. I’d also argue incredibly unisex. I could easily see both men and women pull this off. I think as soon as people smell a powdery fragrance they immediately want to classify it as feminine. Try this one on skin and wear it through a day and I’m sure you’ll reach a different conclusion! It’s very potent for the first couple hours and then becomes a moderate projecting fragrance for a remaining ~6 hours. Before reading any other reviews, I definitely noticed the similarities to Musc Ravageur (although this is slightly less challenging IMHO) followed hours later in the drydown by a sweet reminiscence of Tempo. As I have wanted both of those fragrances, this is a love for me.
It also smells like a cozy old house in the middle of a forest in the dead of winter. Gourmand done in the sophisticated Chanel style. My second favorite of this house after Bois des Iles. 
Sillage and longevity are strong. I am not a pach head as pachouli-dominant perfumes often get musty or screachy on my skin. This is my style if pachouli!
Frankincense and dustings of high end white chocolate with an undercurrent of perfect pachouli. I can't imagine someone not liking this scent. Equally delicious on men and women, any age. I would avoid in hot weather, but otherwise an all occassion scent for me.
The one downside is a synthetic note in the current edp that can be irritating/headache inducing if I over spritz. I love this fragrance. The best from the line for sure in my opinion. It is so timeless so beautiful great performance on my skin. Love the smell the drydown is heaven it is green it is earthy in a good way, it has some sweetnes that is lovely the vanilla vibe mixed with that chocolate is wonderful . It takes you on a journey 👌 I have the EDP version 👍👍 Chanel Coromandel EDP opens with a strong projection of sweet, citrus, green, floral, ambery, and smoky notes. The opening is classy, projecting, elegant, intense, and pleasant. The sweet citrus, and the patchouli, and the opening dominant notes. The bitter orange, neroli, and citrus notes come across as mildly sweet and sour, with a light white floral touch, fresh. Quickly, the patchouli climbs to the top of the pyramid with its very intense, earthy, musky, herbaceous, green, mossy, and persistent accord. As the citruses start to vanish, the floral notes develop creating a pleasant note, just one step behind the patchouli. The combination of these notes creates a powdery, sweet, aromatic, and white floral accord. Towards the dry down, the amber, and benzoin make the fragrance sweet resinous, these resins seat by the side of the flowers. Similarly, the white chocolate creates is a sweet touch but its gourmand aroma is overpowered by the intense patchouli, and floral notes. In the final stage of the dry down, the musk and woody notes develop. The musk is a projecting mild powdery accord, inoffensive, noticeable, but not as much as the incense, and olibanum. The incense is a smoky note, but not churchy, it sharpens, enhances, and projects other notes; the olibanum add its fresh, incense-like, resinous, green pine, woody, and spicy touch. The woody notes are there to provide support, noticeable but not featured. The fragrance has little but noticeable opening to dry down changes, the opening is mostly citrusy sweet, with patchouli and floral touches; as the fragrance moves to its dry down, the citruses take a third or fourth place, the patchouli takes the first, the second is occupied by the floral notes along with the now fully developed sweet, dark resins, the musk, and the mostly sweet white chocolate. At its dry down, the fragrance becomes dry and slightly powdery. Once Chanel Coromandel EDP has reached its full dry down, it can be summarized as a strong projection, green patchouli, sweet, resinous, dark, floral, and musky fragrance with woody accords. The fragrance feels bold, casual, classy, commanding, complex, dated, dark, delectable, dense, dry, earthy, elegant, exotic, expensive, fine, floral, formal, fresh, green, harsh, heavy, herbaceous, high-quality, intense, mature, musky, nocturnal, old-fashion, old-school, mildly persistent, powdery, resinous, refined, smoky, special, sweet, unisex, woody, and pleasant.

SUMMARY: A strong projection, green patchouli, sweet, resinous, dark, floral, and musky fragrance with woody accords. The fragrance feels bold, casual, classy, commanding, complex, dated, dark, delectable, dense, dry, earthy, elegant, exotic, expensive, fine, floral, formal, fresh, green, harsh, heavy, herbaceous, high-quality, intense, mature, musky, nocturnal, old-fashion, old-school, mildly persistent, powdery, resinous, refined, smoky, special, sweet, unisex, woody, and pleasant. I could already smell Coromandel as I learned about it's notes, and the notes are what I assume they would be--Incense, Woods, Sweet notes. I know it would be in the same line as other fragrances such as YSL Opium and Estee Lauder Cinnabar. This is known as the patchouli Mecca for patchouli lovers for a reason. It’s spicy, earthy, rich, and deep with the white chocolate adding that creamy richness to the composition. It still retains that powdery base and sparkle that Chanel is known for. This reminds me of a spicy, smooth, creamy dessert. It’s very well balanced and powerful but still soft and you have to love Chanel and appreciate the sophistication of a grown adult fragrance like this. Tastes change as you age. I still appreciate many fragrances of my youth but I’m growing into more serious fragrances but might not want to wear a grown up fragrance everyday. I save this for certain occasions. I really want to smell the white chocolate in this, but I can’t. I can’t even detect a single trace of white chocolate. All I smell is woody patchouli and citrus. A pleasant smell. I used to dislike this scent in the past but I like it now. I gotta start not listening to so many people who rave about things online lol.
I sprayed the sample on my forearm and let it sit to see if it really changes up to a more amber/woody style but, it didn't.
This one reminds me of the other powdery stuff, like Feve delicious ( for example ) but this one in that regard, is not as baby powdery, but still powdery and soft.
It's nice & pretty and is a little too mature for my liking. Reminds me of an older mans aftershave of sorts.
A woman, I think, could pull this off better than a guy.
You have to like this style of fragrance to really appreciate it because for me, it's a pass.
Seasons: Cool/Cold/Fall/Winter I love this perfume. I smell similarity a little of musc ravageur but more musky. It's so beautiful and soft. For me the dry down of coromandel remind me of maharees ( l'erbolario ). Smell nice woody scent. 
And when i think about maharees, i will think about the dry down of musc ravageur.
For coromandel i give 9 / 10 Inhale and unpack an olfactory picnic; a cashmere blanket of chocolate-infused bitter orange, with a delicious mist of woodsy patchouli drenched in birdsong and dappled light far, far away in a frankincense forest. 
Today's haiku:
coromandel spritz
olfactory journeying
on wings of chanel Sweet and green, and earthy at the same time. Lovely, but Diptyque charges less half the price for a very similar experience with Tempo EdP. I've listened to the fragrance reviewer Eugenius speaking about this fragrance for ages. I went to the Chanel store, and surprisingly they gave me a free sample. I sprayed it, and thought this is such an easy wear. The opening is classic, sort of earthy, warming and just ""easy to wear"". The notes blend very well. The projection is mild. This is next level niche. More than anything, it's just an easy wear, and there isn't anything in this fragrance that is annoying or sharp. If you love a well rounded patchouli, this is great. Special occasion frag like a wedding. For me, Coromandel is a close encounter type of fragrance. *sigh* Coromandel.... where to even begin. 4 years ago I purchased my first 10mL decant of this creation. My initial reaction was confusion.... why were there so many glowing reviews? Where was the white chocolate? This smelled like dirt. Wet earth and lacquered wood. I didn’t get it at all. But I was intrigued and kept sampling it. 
Well, 2 decants and 2 mini bottles later I am committed to a full bottle. I crave this scent every time the weather gets cold. It’s amazing that no one else seems to comment on the realistic lacquered wood smell that the citrus top notes and the patchouli combine to make. Truly a work of art. The opening is a literal Coromandel screen. My grandmother had one when I was a child, and I recall the scent distinctly. This wood/lacquer/wet earth initial blast is the part that has been the most challenging for me to love, but also the most addictive. There’s truly nothing else like it. 
After the top notes fade, I get the most glorious white chocolate amber mix with just a hint of incense. This is not quite gourmand to me, nor is it boring by any stretch. There’s character - a framework of sturdier notes to provide depth and richness to the white chocolate and benzoin.
I’ve attempted other patch-chocolate-gourmand-ish scents, and nothing can compare. I truly wish I’d have saved my money and just committed to a bottle of Coromandel immediately. Coromandel treats me to a sensual, elegant, and rich fragrance experience. Highly recommend! What can I say that hasn’t already been said? I owned the Prada EDP and Jessica Simpson's Fancy Nights and this STILL won me over. I initially thought they smelled identical but Coromandel has something really addictive, captivating, and creamy from start to finish. Compared to Coromandel, Prada EDP seemed very dry and chalky while Fancy Night seemed very screechy and sharp. So the mid notes and dry down of this frag are really what makes it special. 
I love this but it took me a while to learn how to wear because I am always self-conscious of clearing out a room with my bombastic fragrances. You can wear this and get noticed without badgering people over the head with it. I like to put it on an hour before I leave and avoid my neck and wrist area. Trust me, people will be able to smell you. This is so beautiful. I just found a small sample vial that was gifted to me last year but I had not yet opened it until just a few moments ago. I wouldn't normally review a perfume so soon after trying but my fingers felt the urge to fly to these keys after the first few intoxicating sniffs. The Patchouli is prominent from the get go but it stays mellow and is only a tiny bit scratchy. It's grassy and almost fizzy and floats above the rest of the notes like an earthy cloud. Below that the Benzoin, Olibanum, smoke and amber lay on a bed of shaved white chocolate. A subtle muskiness melds it all. None of the citrus notes stand out and the floral is subtle and balancing but nothing screams. Coromandel is just my cup of tea, balmy, dark, mysterious...vampiric. I need to start saving up for a bottle. If you don't have the funds, as another reviewer noted, you can find a close bargain version in Jessica Simpson's Fancy Nights...not nearly as smooth but a close bargain alternative. The best classy signature scent on the market. Drop the mic. 
I can write 20 pages about this but I'll keep my excitement to myself and enjoy the scent. As soon as I can afford to have a bottle again, I’m getting it. This is seemingly one I can’t live without.
I could get fancy and try and untangle the notes, but really I can’t - it’s that well blended and unlike anything else that I’ve tried. This is what I want to smell in heaven. A complete ride or die. 
Totally unisex, and I wear it whenever I want, I find it comforting, warm and elegant. I’m under 30, who cares. Coromandel for me is a very interesting fragrance that represents a milestone in my fragrance journey so to speak. It is the first fragrance I have bought that is relatively expensive and it is also my first blind buy.
What really made me curious about the fragrance was both the story behind it and the white chocolate note, ever since I was a kid I have loved white chocolate and as such I knew I had to try this at one point.
I must admit that upon my initial spray I was not particularly impressed and was a little worried I had made an expensive mistake. My mother, who is a big Chanel fan, has always told me that Chanel fragrances need time to settle so with her advice in mind I reserved making an immediate judgement. The initial blast opens up with a very sharp note, which I suspect has something to do with the bitter orange/citrus.
Fast forward about 1 hour and the sharp note that I disliked had dissipated. Further the fragrance started developing into what I was hoping for in the first place, a more creamy woody scent that was rather comforting. The incense note also became increasingly more noticeable and reminded me of a church somehow. It is never overpowering but really compliments the buttery aspect of the fragrance nicely.
Is Coromandel what I was expecting when I bought it? No, it is actually better in my opinion. I was expecting a fragrance but instead got an experience. Coromandel has changed the way I look at fragrances no joke.
Since my initial wearing I've gone on to wear it a number of times and each time I am left with the same comforting feeling. My mother has also worn it multiple times and I love it on her just as much as I love it on myself. 
I do not recommend blind-buying expensive fragrances as this but if you have even a slight interest in Coromandel do yourself a favor and get your hands on a sample, I'm certain you won't be disappointed. I'm not sure why I get a Tom Ford Beau de Jour vibe initially and a bit of Nasomatto Pardon as well. I don't really get any white chocolate personally. I get some citrous notes in the beginning with aldehydic notes. Then in the dry down I get incense and musk with a hint of sweetness. This was not what I expected prior to trying it. I could see that this is a very versatile scent. Could be worn all year round in most occasions. It's personally not my kind of scent because I'm not a fan of aldehydic scents, but I can see that it could be pleasing to many people. The impression I get from Coromandel: 
You have been digging up a patch in your garden with your friend/significant other, so you could plant irises next to your rose and jasmine bushes. You take a break and sit at a table, drink some fresh orange juice and have bits of creamy white chocolate ever so slightly melted by the scorching sun as a little snack. 
There is a last bit of a treat sitting on the plate, you hurry to pick it up but your friend wants it too and holds on to the plate as well; you engage in this cute little squabble and continue to pull the plate back and forth until the treat goes flying and lands on the very patch that you have freshly dug up. 
You both realise what you’ve done, run towards it, fall onto your knees. The sun has been shining quite heavily, so the chocolate, soil, iris bulbs are all warmed up with the kiss of a sun – this is what Coromandel smells like. 
The patch mixed with orris root is this earthy smell of fresh damp soil, which is very strong and can be overpowering at the beginning, and juxtaposed with the sweetness of the benzoin quite confusing. In the drydown it is mostly ambery/benzoiny almost vanillic, with delicate accents of patchouli, orris root, maybe rose and jasmine, however they are very distant. 
It is a long-lasting scent, however, the projection is only strong at the beginning, then it becomes a delicate reminder of a sweet aftertaste of white chocolate. If you like Mugler's Angel, this is probably a step-up in quality you might want to consider. This is without a doubt my favourite fragrance, it is just a heavenly scent that is soft, seductive, mature, sophisticated and addictive, I literally look strange constantly sniffing my arm when in public. 
This fragrance just does something to me, its like a buzzer goes off in my head saying this is the best thing I have ever smelt. It is in a different class let alone realm to anything I have smelt. 
The complexity, depth, quality and longevity is astounding. I do not mind causing serious harm to my savings in getting a bottle of this. 
Its for 35 years up formal or smart chic attire, not an office scent! This is crazy good on men. I bought it for myself and I do appreciate it on myself but I also sprayed my husband and it smells so good on him. He actually loves it too and he isn't a perfume guy. It's a very woody/leafy patchouli/ancient incensed church back in the Renaissance scent on him and it's gorgeous. On me it's more of a sweet amber incensed white chocolate atop a deeply blended leafy patchouli & benzoin bed. Wonderful. My favorit-Coromandel de CHANEL!I love it! The most beautiful smell ever ❤️ Funny how the Parfum doesn't get as many great reviews as this one does. I'm going to have to try it : )
Ordered a sample. Now this is a magnificent fragrance that just enthralls you at first sniff.
A refined smooth blast of patchouli kicks things off followed by the most gorgeous frankincense accord that I have smelled in a fragrance. This is followed by white chocolate and a beautiful rose note. These notes are a marriage made in heaven.
The lovely enchanted blend is quite strong for a few hours with the incense leading the way for dominance over your nose. Eventually the beautiful scent calms down and the incense takes the backseat as the white chocolate and patchouli gently take over. 
The projection and sillage are decent and I get about ten hours longevity. 
This is a perfect 10 out of 10 in my book and one of the most intoxicating fragrances I have ever smelled. Big thumbs up! Anyone know how to give a perfume a rating? Can't find that anywhere..
Anywho, I bought this years ago after doing a blind sniff test with a Chanel rep and each time I picked this perfume! It is an absolute treasure and has been my favourite for years. This is also the first niche , over $100, perfume i treated myself to. Hard to describe but it has everything I love, spice, balsam, powder , just amazing! If you like spicy/oriental scents this is a must try. I bought 10ml decant of this les exclusif just to try. 
Tbh, I’ve never smelled patchouli before (well, I guess, except cheap patchouli oil from home fragrances section at SM) and this is the “aha” moment for me transitioning from mere theory to actual olfactory. Coromandel is oriental – earthy and woody, which I found clean and powdery. No wonder that it was inspired by Chinese lacquered screens at Coco Chanel’s apartment. The dry down is interesting, it evolves to white chocolate scent! Love it! ❤️
Beware! this perfume is ”VERY TITA” HAHAHA not for the faint of heart! 😂
I’ll wear this to school soon para tapusin ang clearance at nang makabili na ng full bottle. Eme! 😂 Very funny story with this perfume...I was working in a hotel and a gentleman apear in front of me smelling divine...I almost fainted:)))Because I heard about this perfume and I couldn't make any connection with another fragrance that I known already I thought that should be the king of the perfumes....COROMANDEL
I had never smelled Coromandel,but my cousin told me many times that she discovered this perfume in Dubai and is smelling amazing...like nothing else on this planet:)))
This man (he was arabic) ask me to solve a problem in his room and when I enter I've seen 2 big bottles of Coromandel on his office and since that moment I fall in love with this fragrance .
I can bath in this fragrace...I have an obsession with perfumes but this is no.1 for me. I like both EDT and EDP, EDT for hot humid day, EDP for cooler day. Brilliant, one of my favorite perfumes.. 5/5. I retract my previous review dismissing this perfume. I tried it once, found my interest waned after an hour, then set the sample aside on my desk to remind me to try it again. There it sat for a year. 
Picked it up again today and POW it hit me how delightful it is. Not exciting, not challenging, not ""artistic"", just delightful. This is a very pleasant fragrance, and sometimes that's exactly what I need. 
Smooth like cashmere. Spicy, but neither hot nor invigorating. Warm, balanced, and charming. The white chocolate note is not as toothachingly sweet as Guerlain's Elixir Charnel Gourmand Coquin. The patchouli doesn't hit you over the head like Angel, and the sweetness isn't as over the top as Angel Muse.
I'm on my third spray of the day (sample size) and the citrus notes are rounding out the spices so nicely. This one may be next on my shopping list.
Update: I drained the sample vial and committed to a full bottle. No regrets. I find myself loving this, but wanting it less than I did with my first bottle. The EdT I also love, but I don't own that. I've discovered that the longevity issue I had with my first bottle doesn't persist here and it actually does last longer than 15 hours. I purchased this again a few days ago and gave it a good shot last night and am adoring it. May be for only special 'I want so much creamy, kinda funky patchouli' moods that can't be satiated by Coco Mademoiselle. Be wary, though, especially in the dry down this can be a bit too much and projects insanely. This is still a glorious fragrance and the quality is phenomenal, I think I just wore it a bit too much and need a bit of breathing space. Few days of wearing now...
Sweet, but not too sweet thanks to the patchouli and citruses notes.
After a few minutes, I get kinda powdery vibe, which reminds me a bit of Tom Ford Noir EDP.
The white chocolate makes it addicting, I just can't stop smelling it.
It gives me that cozy vibe, like a hug in a bottle. Love it!
Lasts a long time as a skin scent on me. Coromandel - Snuck up on me and all of the sudden I am addicted. Sweet, warm and elegant. One of the best patchouli fragrances I have in my collection. That not so earthy elegant dark chocolate note makes this gem the perfect gourmand. It’s a love for me! Bought this in a whim at an airport based on the great reviews, tried it - and actually, at first regretted getting it. However during the past year, I have grown to love this. 
Coromandel EDP is fantastic for someone who wants to be taken seriously, but also wants to appear approachable. I find that while Chanel N.19 is a scent for a cold boss lady, Coromandel is a scent for a independent woman with great authority, but also with a warm heart. 
Not the biggest compliment getter as the scent is a bit odd (in the best way possible), however once a lady said I smelled incredible at the gym, 6+ hours after applying a few sprays. My boyfriend also adores this on me.
Classy, timeless, for anyone and for any occasion. 10/10. Wow. I've always been drawn to the aldehydic DNA of Chanel's fragrances and like many was introduced through an important woman in my life. That being said, nothing ever felt quite right on me to justify purchasing. No 19 is beautiful but i'm not ready, COCO is gorgeous but it gives me a supreme headache. 
Coromandel snuck up on me and like many here, I became addicted. It's sophisticated, creamy, and still has that familiarity of a Chanel. Tested a sample from a fellow Fragrantican, don't know which formulation.
---
Lovely, sweet, warm, elegant. The sweetest patchouli I have ever tried, mixed with woods, dark, old and mellowed, resins, a note like beeswax, chocolate (melty sweet mixture of milk and white chocolate, not the earthy dark one), and something like caramelized jam. 
Elegant but edible, gourmand but perfume-y, both comforting and sexy. Well done!
So good! I would love to have it! Absolute class and refinement. Unfortunately this smells way too feminine on my skin. This smells, to me, like a high class 42-43 years old milf. Spicy white chocolate with the signature Chanel metallic buzzing undertone. Wearing it tonight and holy s%$# this is Amazing 
It is so strong, fill up my car . So if this is watered down i cant imagine how strong the original performed 
This is for now the number 1 scent in my collection On my skin, clean patchouli, vanilla and spices. 
Like a warm blanket. And I mean, the most luxurious blanket you can think of. 
A sunny winter Sunday. You, your loved one and your adorable pet, on the couch watching a romantic comedy under a luxurious blanket.
I haven't smelled any other formulation than the latest one. And to be honest I'm tired of the fact that half the reviews on this website are about possible watering down and how it was always better before. 
I like the fact that it isn't so strong. 
This moderate level of projection suits this specific scent. If you want to project all day, get a pocket spray. And even that way you'll get your money worth. This blend is so high end, round, full, magical.
It smells like quality. Like old money.
Edit: this is the best! I want to bathe in it! I can't wait to get my hands on a 200ml bottle. Then I can feel less bad for over spraying. This it so comforting you guys!
NEW SIGNATURE !
Edit 30/08/20
I got into this in January so I've never experienced this in the fall. . I know it's still summer but today is a fall like day in Belgium. 17celcius, rainy. Coromandel really shines like this! And it projects today like never before. So happy. Bring on the fall! This is life changing.. Expensive white chocolate, amazing patchouli, great benzoin, blended out of this world, to create the most amazing elixir. Disgustingly good 17/10 It’s a huge blast of patchouli. It’s so sharp that I cannot smell other notes in the opening.
The patchouli lasts about 30 mins. Then comes the musk and creamy chocolate and vanilla.
This perfume is complex and well blended.
The scent lasts super, super long. I spray it in the morning and it always stays until I take a shower at night, even after a heavy excercise. It’s also heavy (but not ugly)
Sadly I’m not a fan of patchouli. I have been layering Coromandel successfully with Indonesian Oud Ermenegildo Zegna for men. 
Zegna's Indonesian Oud is so strong that I start with just one or two sprays which are good for the entire day and amps up the rose, woods, and patchouli in Coromandel in addition to adding a clean soapy vibe. I then spritz Coromandel as the day progresses. I love this combination. 
Have some fun with your collection and experiment by combining Coromandel with those fragrances that have notes in common in addition to adding other desirable complementing notes. 
What are some of your favorite Coromandel layering companions? Direct test EDT vs EDP:
EDT opens up with a huge punch of aldehydes (which are not listed on the notes breakdown). Except the opening the fragrances are almost the same. EDT is much louder, has a quite big patchouli/chocolate punch.
EDP on the other hand opens up much tamer and smoother (what I prefer). It seems to be much more woody and smoky. There's a lot of incense hanging around. Also there seems to be more benzoin hanging around.
In general EDT seems to be fuller, more round and full balanced, EDP might seem to be more quiet and tamer, but I smell it different. 
To me EDP is more elegant and much more fits as an office fragrance which you can easily wear for a business meeting. EDT is too loud for that - at least for me.
EDT seems to be more mature, 40+. IMO EDP is more like 25+. for me.
If you prefer more patchouli - choose EDT.
If you prefer more woods, benzoin and incense - go with EDP.
The EDP seems to be more unisex leaning towards fragrance for men, EDT on the other hand seems to be more like a fragrance for women leaning towards unisex. In general both men and women can pull off EDT as well as EDP. This is quintessential Chanel to me.
It’s so universal, I feel like anyone between 18 and 108 could wear this, man or female. It’s classy but within reach, familiar yet not basic, great longevity but close to skin after a couple hours. The dualism of patchouli and benzoin is so comforting that you could take a bath in this. The scent doesn’t evolve much after the first 30 minutes and what’s not to love about it? Also the way this lingers on clothes is heavenly. 
Expensive, yes . But worth every penny Chanel Coromandel EDP
Opens up with a mix of aldehydes (a lot of them), flowers and a pinch of white chocolate (hidden far behind). I cannot smell any singular flower (rose per se or any other). This dries down into patchouli (rather not raw, but not very mild on the other hand) - sweet, cozy and warming; resins and incense (this is in the background but is detectable). The patchouli here gives you chocolate'y vibe so all combined together might smell for some like there is a milk chocolate with cocoa.
The longevity on me is 12 hours, sillage is good for 4 hours, then i sticks to the skin. I go with 2 or 3 sprays, I don't need any more.
I can see why some smell resemblance to Mugler Angel or Prada Amber. This is a nice patchouli overall but not the best on the market. My favourite patch remains Tom Ford Patchouli Absolu. I discovered Les Exclusifs through this one. It's the best of the line to me, followed by Sycomore. What a nice, soft patchouli. Wait for the dry down to get it mixed with the citruses and the white chocolate accord. Another very addictive fragrance to me. A bit too much on the feminine side but I don't mind in this case. Long story short, this fragrance is fit for a king (or queen). Opens up with a blast of patchouli but lasts for the first hour and drys down into a milky white chocolate aroma which lasts and lasts. I haven’t smelled any of the previous EDTs so I’m not gonna make any comparisons on that but so far the EDPs are really intriguing me. Why oh why didn’t i discover the line earlier ?! Them 200ml bottles don’t come cheap in Singapore, it’s retailing for 570 Singapore dollars. But then again Coromandel is a scent you might wanna consider splurging the coin to smell like a king (or queen). Opens with powdery orange and florals. It has a creamsicle vibe. Then the woods come in, reminiscent of the cedar and cinnamon in Egoiste. It then settles in beautifully and the patchouli takes control. Unisex but it seems to lean a bit masculine to my nose. Classy. Will probably be my signature fragrance along with Pierre de Velay 1. Elegance! Legendary perfume! 
A perfect combo of patchouli & white chocolate by Mr. Polge. 
This is how I imagine Dr Hannibal Lecter from Hannibal series would smell like. It's bright, classy, sophisticated, yet deep and mysterious in the same time if it make sense! I never thought patchouli would smell like this.
Signature worthy. Review for the edp. First off, I love this fragrance. I’ve heard so many good things about it, and it didn’t disappoint. 
Coromandel is, in my opinion, a white chocolate and vanilla gourmand with the Chanel dna. There is a patchouli note here, but on my skin, the patchouli disappeared very quickly during the dry down. It turns into a sophisticated powdery white chocolate, and stays for a long time like that. After almost 12 hours, it turns into a vanilla. It has quite the longevity, and will only be completely gone with a shower. The projection is so-so, not overwhelming. The gourmand notes are never too sweet or cloying, and I mention the Chanel dna because I can somehow detect a similar feel to my Chanel no. 5 parfum in this. I feel the patchouli isn’t overdone here, and it makes it much more versatile if you go easy in the sprays. Truly a masterpiece and a must-try for Chanel and gourmand lovers. But I advise testing this first before buying because the patchouli note may be a turn-off for some. I finally got to sniff this. 
My interest in this fragrance was piqued when I heard about it a few months ago. Just the name alone; its representation. Coromandel is a type of black lacquer wood, generally, seen in Asian panel/screens. Coco Chanel apartment famously feature a coromandel screen ( first seen by myself in the 90's Coco Perfume Advertisement) 
I could already smell Coromandel as I learned about it's notes, and the notes are what I assume they would be--Incense, Woods, Sweet notes. I know it would be in the same line as other great Asian influence fragrances such as YSL Opium and Estee Lauder Cinnabar.
Which has me contemplating the uniqueness of Coromandel. Today, 2019, no one is doing this. I consider this to be very vintage. Actually when I first heard about it, I assume it was a hidden Chanel fragrance from yesteryears. ( it only dates back to 2012 or something).
Though I love Opium and Cinnabar, would I wear Coromandel?? Probably not. There;'s something about it that's just not me . Something very green in it that off put the spices and incense. It's strong, musk oriented---nothing soft about it. Coromandel reminds me of a harder and surprisingly sweeter Sahara Noir-Tom Ford (wasn't that hard enough) 
However, a fragrance like this needed to be in the Chanel repertoire. It condones Coromandel expensive price. Chanel Coromandel is good stuff, --- the whole concept,-good stuff. You should definitely give it a sniff.
6/5/20: purchased and wearing Just received my decant and I'm really enjoying it. I was given a task to choose one perfume for Christmas, and oh, boy, what a job! lol
I went to a Chanel store and tested many of the Les Exclusifs. My intention was to choose Sycomore - which I already knew - , but its resemblance with Vetivert Guerlain is so striking that, IMO, it would't worth investing in a full bottle. Finally, above all, Channel 22 grabbed my attention, so I decided to apply in myself to feel how it evolved. Again, I found it very close to White Linen, thus... same story.
At the store, I didn't like Coromandel, since I felt it smelled like, at first, cocoa butter (the white chocolate people mention here), then wet soil, then nothing.
But with my decant at home (that I have previously ordered), now, I better understand Coromandel.
At first, it has a vibe of Angel, yes, maybe because of coumarine. Later, I feel the wet soil again (patchouli, surely) mixed with some powdery notes. And, to Finnish with a flourish, a delicious woody base notes. For me, it's a combination of sandalwood, vanilla and vetiver (I'm surprised no one has never mentioned vetiver, it's so apparent for me).
I'll use my 10 ml decant for the next weeks, and I'll update my impressions later. But this is a potential full bottle for my next purchase.
Edit: after several full wearings, is a drop off for me. I recognised a strange smell from my childhood, in the kindengarden. It was acrious, sour and pungent. In this kindergarden, there was a piscine with sand, that we delightly played all afternoons. It was only after decades later that I recognized this smell as... cat pee! Obviously, all the cat in the neighbourhood around mt kindergarden would make theis need in our field of games... go figure. At first, smelling this in coromandel was nkstalgic. But later, unbearable. Searching for comments here i find none. Am I the only who smells cat pee in coromandel??? Leans slightly feminine for the first 5 mins, but once it settles it's gorgeous.
To me, it's a little inscensy on the skin, but the scent trail is really nice. I only have a decant which I'm trying to save, as I don't really want to fork out an arm and a leg for it, especially when there's so many other 'wants' on my radar.
Tough for me to pick out individual notes, but smoothly blended.
It's not a screamer, and longevity is only average at best on me, but when you get a whiff of the scent when you move around, you realise how good it is.
One of those you wish they made a 30ml bottle of. I once complimented a very elegant client on her on her perfume and she opened her handbag and took out a full size bottle of Coromandel. It is a truly magnificent fragrance. Bought it yesterday, so only wore it once.
My first impression: it reminds me of Chanel Pour Monsieur Eau de Parfum (2016). A tamer version that is. Much tamer.
More suitable for women. Soft delicate scent and projection. Soft but solid. It does last. 
12 hours later it was still noticeable on my skin. But it keeps remind me of the male powerhouse. The vanilla like sweetness. 
But there is no vanilla in Coromandel you may say. 
But there is no white chocolate without vanilla either. Pretty sure this was reformulated. I have a 2019 bottle and the projection is nice, I said nice not beast mode, and only for 40 minutes. Then it goes on to be a skin scent for 6 hours. 
Also, the smell isn't the same as I remember it to be, I've had an EDP decant 2-3 years ago and you could tell that the fragrance developed. Now? I feel like it's a whole cacophony where you can't tell what is which. It feels muddled and with no beginning, no mid and no ending. As beautiful as everyone says but doesn’t project and short longevity. I tried this a couple years ago (got a sample from a friend) and I didn't like it at all. Remember feeling like it smelled dated, old manish (or old ladyish? Since I've found out this is for women).
Tried it again the other day and was surprised by how much I liked it the second time around.
Very smooth, balanced, classy vibe I get from this one. Seems suited for more formal occassions, for cooler weather. Performance is very solid.
Not sure I'd buy a bottle yet, but I'd like a decant for a special occasion. The hype is real!!!
I'm so glad I purchased this fragrance.
Is this a masterpiece? Oh hell yes!
Perfect for that cold day when you wear your fancy coat.
This is a one spray on my skin. It's a powerhouse. My mom gave me this one before one week and she said “I want you to be a classy boy so wear this”, Now I’m just saying thank you mom for a new signature scent. INCREDIBLE! This is how I must begin my review! My husband just returned from Sweden & Switzerland and made a special visit to the Chanel Boutique in central Stockholm and bought me a 200ml bottle of Coromandel edP (such an amazing surprise). 
I have been wanting this for a while, but for some reason (lazy, lol) I have not driven to our local Chanel store in (not far away) Beverly Hills, CA.
The notes have been discussed by a lot of reviewers, so I will not bore anyone with more talk on specific notes. When I put Coromandel on...it is a combo (on my skin) of: Jessica Simpson Fancy Nights, Mugler Angel, Chanel No 5 and Shalimar. There is also a slight smokiness or woodiness that makes this not a sweet gourmand fragrance, but there is some hidden sweetness, that I am crazy about!
Coromandel is just incredible, and I am so happy Chanel markets this as Unisex (as ALL fragrances are)! If you like it, wear it ;) Longevity is very good, but not excellent. I get about 6 strong hours (much longer on clothes though) and projection and sillage are soft, but now weak. I am totally in LOVE with Coromandel. I had and loved the previous formulation, but haven’t worn it for a few years. Last week I pulled out the last drops from my wardrobe and remembered how amazing it was. Whoever I talked to, asked me what I was wearing, and I felt so beautiful and elegant! The very last drop was used today in the morning and now I just had the opportunity to try the edp at an airport. It opens in a less spectaculat manner - as others wrote, there is no patchouli blast, so it seems less woody and less intense. I went for a walk around the store and a few minutes later my beloved smell was back. I asked my husband if I should get a bottle regardless of the missing big bang in the beginning. He hugged me, smelling my neck and hair, and said: well, we, at the first sight, might not seem as attractive as we used to be, but you know deep inside we get better and better everyday... I burst out laughing. Quite a point. A brand new bottle of Coromandel is now mine. ❤️ WoW...that's all I can say when I wear this perfume...and that seems to be what others around me say, as well. On one of the first days I wore this perfume, I had about 12 strangers or acquaintances come up to me and say ""what are you wearing...you smell incredible!""
I was turned on to Coromandel when someone told me it might be a more affordable alternative to ""Portrait of a Lady"" or ""Musc Ravageur"" both by Frederic Malle. Does it smell similar to either...yes! Is it an affordable alternative to either...sadly, no!
It's the jasmine that captures my nose (I adore Creed's Jasmin Imperatrice Eugenie) but this is ""thick"" or heavy jasmine, which at times smells almost like rose. I'm sure the introduction of patchouli is what makes this stuff smell so ""heady"" to me...not hippy dirty like heady...heady in a good way! The overall blend and balance between all the glorious notes is what makes this fragrance work so well, IMHO. And (fortunately) on my skin, I do not detect many gourmand notes (chocolate?) at all...don't even wish to think about it...the chocolate that is...a bit of vanilla in the dry-down is there for sure! 
To me, at no time does one singular note seem to over-take or overwhelm the fragrance (okay...perhaps the patchouli does try from time-to-time). However overall, this fragrance is a wonderful balance of all the main notes, beginning to end.
And YES...this stuff is costly but longevity is great, silage is (obviously) superior and the overall experience is lovely.
I love this fragrance and I've taken to wearing it 3-4 days a week. I've already commented before below but had to come back because I've been wearing it a lot lately and the more I wear Coromandel the more I reminisce on how much I actually love it. It's the benzoin, incense, white chocolate and patchouli that is so incredibly well done. You feel so mature, classy and sophisticated when you wear Chanel fragrances. They are just that good! I think I will always own this fragrance though. I don't know what took me so long to get it but now that I have it when I wear it it boosts my confidence through the roof and my husband loves it on me. He loves Chanel so much that he has taken over my Coco Noir. This fragrance is not one that you will ever get tired of. This is a must own out of anything that Chanel has..this and Coco Chanel, Coco Mademoiselle & Intense, Chanel No 5., Chanel No 19 Poudre & Chanel Chance & Chance Eau Fraiche. Once you go Chanel it's pretty hard to turn back. The glittering review s and high praise convinced me to sample the edp and for the first 10 minutes I thought ok, interesting, classy, pleasant and literally 30 minutes later I'm having to dig my nose into my wrist to smell, no bubble projection or sillage ? For the price and praise in was expecting fireworks and got a sparkler. This perfume speaks to me, it is strong and balanced- two qualities that I am clinging to more than ever these days- in this journey we call life. I had never smelled benzoin done so wonderfully, until Coromandel. How this can be so heavy AND aromatic at the same time? This version has a little less patch than the EDT to my nose, but it's perfectly gorgeous all the same. An absolute must-have and signature worthy for sure. Simply, legendary.
Whenever you wear this perfume, you'll absolutely receive many compliments.
VERY long lasting, and the more time passes > the better it becomes.
This perfume does not have a particular time or season that it is preferred to be worn at, you can wear it anytime. That blast of dirty patchouli in the start lasts about 5 minutes on my skin. Then... the magic begins to happen. Turns into a powdery chocolate/earthy scent that explodes with goodness! You really feel like you are wearing a well made and classy perfume when this is your SOTD. Very addictive fragrance and I believe it's worth every penny. Great stuff! 
Completely unisex btw. Chanel cormendal, blind buy because of a lot of praise, but believe me will not regret it .
- Do not wait for me to give my opinion in the notes.
- This fragrance is inhaled by your feelings not your nose, it's the smell of attractive man in elegant clothes, has a romantic date with a very beautiful woman wearing 
(Coco Mademoiselle Chanel). 
- This is a smell that can not be missed by a girl dreaming of romance .
- It smells love, this is smell that touches your senses . 
- I apologize if you exaggerate the description, but it is the only truth in my opinion ...
❤️💕🥰💕❤️
- Wear this fragrance and go on a journey to find your dream girl.😍😍😍 On my skin, it opens quite masculine with the lead of resins and frankincense, accompanied by a noticeable patchouli supporting note, as well as a hint of vanillic sweetness (supposedly white chocolate) and a hint of smoky incense.
After an hour, a dark (but clean) patchouli blooms, the resins and vanilla go in the background, the frankincense and incense fade out.
As I said before, the opening is pretty mineral/frankincens-y. Added to the patchouli, which is typically a masculine note, one may thinks it is a fragrance for men, but no, Chanel manages to keep it unisex thanks to the vanilla background. So I would say that the opening is unisex leaning masculine, while the drydown is totally unisex. Projection is good in the first hour, then becomes moderate. Longevity is above average. A very luxury smelling fragrance, best for formal occasions.
As for many of Chanel creations, it's a beautiful fragrance, but a horrible price. Will probably get a split though, because i need it in my life.
Colder evenings, 30+ Really nice DNA! Very sophisticated and mature...elegant and professional. My credit score went up simply by spraying this on.
Besides the patchouli dominant note, the rest had me baffled...but the entire blend had me loving it. I can’t tell if this is earthy, or gourmand, both??? Doesnt matter, because this works on me. My wife liked this o me, but thought it was too masculine for her to wear.
This is an experience. I recommend getting a decent of this like I did and checking it out yourself. I will be saving up for a future purchase. I won't lament over the differences between edp and edt. Plenty have done that already. I've accepted the change and embraced the edp as its own separate fragrance because I wanted to give it a chance. I wasn't ready to give up on Coromandel.
I didn't expect the edp to live up to the original, like I said I'm treating it as it's own scent. But man. In doing so I'm equally as disappointed in its lasting power as I'd been had I never smelled the edt. And projection? This is where it's hardest for me not to compare. It's really poor, and I say that with sadness not anger. I get 20 minutes of a beautiful opening and past that I can't smell it in the air around me anymore. I don't have a sinus infection and I'm not anosmic nor a smoker. After an hour my nose has to be half an inch from where I sprayed to detect anything at all. It lasts 6 or 8 hours, but what good is it if I can't smell anything without pressing my nose to wrist?
I'm adding my two cents to the jar. Had I never smelled the edt for reference I'd feel the same way. Chanel is laughing their way to the bank with this one. Buy yourself Mademoiselle Intense, or better yet Prada Amber Intense and save yourself the disappointment. I really love this one!Sampled a few others from the line,but as a male,liked this most,including Sycomore.But this was more original than Sycomore as there are many similar vetiver scents on the market.But Coromandel really shines.It is in it's own league.I love it's decadence(but never old) and refinment,suits me so well.And I never thought of leaning to one sex more than another,and never thought about the word polarizing,and chalenging in the same sentence with this one,you don't have to worry about that.I think I'll never get enough of this scent as I'm alive...it's a masterpiece,in the real meaning of that word. Unusual for a Chanel. White chocolate and patchouli. If you hate Angel by Mugler, you might struggle with this. The patchouli is very noticeable and can get earthy and strange on your skin. But the scent is unique and sweet. It's a different direction than most of the Chanels.
Got a compliment on this today 2/12/19 from a co-worker. (KK) I can compare the Edp vs Edt because I remember what the Edt smelled like when I went to Saks Fifth Ave on 5th Ave New York in 2010-11. The Edt was the same fragrance the only difference was that with the Edt it was more sparkly on the tops with the citrus opening and it was a stronger fuller version of this fragrance...This one seems watered down and more masculine because the citrus notes are missing more.. In a sense I do miss that from the Edt and that is what made it very special the sparkling citrus notes that balanced the fragrance out so it wouldn't smell like it was watered down..why they changed that I don't understand.t..I'm so sad about all these reformulations..but more than the reformulations because we know it must happen just the direction fragrances have turned lately..they don't even feel like fragrances anymore but colognes..
Now the Edp does still have the citrus but it's more toned down and you get more of the patchouli, benzoin, white chocolate from the get go. I believe men could pull this off even more now because without the sweet champagne citrus affect it is more on the masculine side but it still is unisex for sure..so both sides can enjoy this equally. As the Edp dries down you begin smelling more of the incense and it is so comforting. You can also smell more of the citrus now but that tones down too and it's not sparkly..but you can smell it. It's interesting that in the Edt you smell the citrus right off the bat and strong almost like the feel of champagne but in this one it comes in more in the dry down. I like how this develops because with all the notes it almost comes off smelling like it has honey with the mixture of the benzoin, white chocolate and incense. Mind you though I miss the Edt version and I wish I had bought this back then but I have to let the Edt version go and just enjoy this scent for what it is..As a collector of fragrances I had to have this classic in my collection but after I finish my bottle of Coromandel I am debating if I will ever repurchase this ever again because the magic it once had is gone. Don't get me wrong it still smells wonderful better than all the designer fragrances that have tried to copy it and maybe I will repurchase this if I can't find the Edt version for a fair price.. but if you think this smells amazing try getting your hands on the Edt..you will be amazed at how much more different it is from this one.
Update: I have been testing this out more and more..even though I know there has been a change in this formula...I have to admit I still love the scent of Coromandel...perhaps it's growing on me..I think knowing the EdT beforehand has spoiled me a bit but I'm trying to appreciate this fragrance more...as I test this out I get exhilarated and I realize I do still love it..if your a Coromandel fan you will love this..it's classy and pleasing..I'm drawn to patchouli scents like this..so much so I would stock up on scents with similar patchouli's like Prada Amber intense and Fancy Nights..and buy back ups..I think I need to be realistic that I am just drawn to this scent and Coromandel is in a class of it's own when it comes to a strong patchouli scent..I love Mugler's Angel for the same reason and Coromandel is still refreshing..though the Edp might be heart breaking to many of us who loved the Edt..the heart of the fragrance is still there and you will love it at the end of the day..don't lose hope in this fragrance..its just as lovely and will grow on you.I will only use this on special occasions and the other versions for everyday use since they are not that expensive in comparison to this fragrance until I can get a bigger bottle.. for now the 2.5oz will suffice. I have the EDP. The initial blast is a cologne hit. It quickly warms to a powdery medicinal scent with an underlying sweetness that blooms. The evolution of the scent reminds me of 31 Rue Cambon which I also love. The drydown is enveloping- rich, milky incense, sweet but not cloying. Wonderful! This is a fragrance I was fully prepared to love. Based on enamored reviews and promising notes, I bought a bunch of samples so I could really get an honest feel for the fragrance and wear it plenty of times before investing in it --as I fully planned to buy it. But then I smelled it.
The most sour odor of mildew and dirt hit me in the face. Yes I can smell the white chocolate which is nice, but the rest of this fragrance smells exactly like wet clothes that have been forgotten in the washing machine and left to mildew for several days. Just dank, moldy and dirty smelling. I suspect the patchouli as a culprit. I was gagged by this fragrance --and I'm no lightweight, I like Tom Ford's Black Orchid well enough (which also has a slight dank, dirty vibe). 
Every now and then I spritz this on again in the hopes that I'll smell the magic that everyone else does --then I have to go violently scrub it off.
Very disappointed. I was reluctant to review this fragrance, but it serves as a reminder never to blind buy anything no matter how adored it is or what notes it lists. not fan of patchouli and benzoin
but coromandel change my mind
first blast with citrus that rapid gone away in few secs
follow with heavy patchouli and woody that didnot good for my nose
but after few mins the white milky chocolate note came out
if u smell in the air it's great great blend with other note
you need to smell it in the air because
if you sniff it nearly the skin the earthy woody note will strike your nose heavily
like other patchouli frag IMO
truly truly unisex Briefly speaking, at the beginning it reminds me of Angel by Mugler, which I hate as it's too sickly, then it smells very masculine.My husband loves the smell more than I do ;-) Amazing perfume, blind buy from Chanel site. Addicting. I think I have finally found my favourite Chanel fragrance! When I first got my nose on the sample I ordered, I was struck by its similarity to Fancy Nights by Jessica Simpson, which I also own and love. Fancy Nights does not have the decadence and luxurious tone that Coromandel has, however, they are both amber heavy and beautiful in different ways. 
Coromandel is very ethereal yet striking, loud yet quiet, current yet classic; it's certainly a juxtaposed composition in many ways. It doesn't leap off the skin and fill a room but is quietly intoxicating and certainly has an inviting quality. As far as notes go, I get amber, patchouli and a tiny hint of white chocolate. 
I think I need to buy a full bottle soon! I tested this at the Chanel Counter in Fenwick, Newcastle (should that be the channel coonter?) I digress.
First impressions? Lord above. Way too powerful!
It was a boxing glove at high velocity. A cacophony of notes so crowded into each other that it felt like standing at the front of a Metallica concert with your head in the Marshall speakers at 11+.
I moved away with great speed, waving the spill in a desperate attempt to disperse the perfume equivalent of a Prize Wrestler.
However, some time later, I retrieved the spill from my pocket.
Oh, regrets! I was chastened, filled with remorse for my previous hasty recoil, for Coromandel had slid, ever so gently into a diaphanous veil of incense and confection, the like of which I had never experienced before!
Not my usual balance at all. I was confused that my fragrant bete noir, namely patchouli in any other guise than on it’s own, as an oil, was in a mix, with something decidedly vannilary/gourmand, making chocolate sheeps eyes at me. I was loving it, playing olfactory blind man’s buff in this current of fragrant joy.
It is always a mark of genius when the notes become so enraptured with one another that the whole formula takes on a life of it’s own, like a colour you cannot imagine, or a sound no one has ever heard before. Something so alien and beautiful, you can barely imagine it originated on earth. I must take it as read that the notes are; citrus, rose, patchouli, vanilla, incense, orris, benzoin, olibanum, neroli, jasmine, musk and woods. Seriously. I get some beautiful, edible flower which only grows on Pandora. I have no words. To quote Ellie Arroway in the movie “Contact”; “No words, they should have sent a poet”.
In all my years of sniffing, inhaling, tasting and testing, I have never come across a successful match of patchouli and gourmand. Not ever. Not until now. I don’t think anyone else could have managed it. I suspect witchcraft. Yes. That must be what it is.
It’s an amazing perfume . I have to run away from myself for 5-10 mins or so after spraying, I still don’t like the intense bitter jetstream which first leaves the bottle, but the progress through to and beyond drydown is so worth it.
Strangely, I have had no compliments. I have to put this down to the ladies hereabouts favouring the modern fruity candyfloss perfumes which proliferate the shelves in Fenwicks (the best parfumerie in the North East), and the fellows seeking out the magnetic intensity of kebabs, craft beers and bacon sandwiches. Nevertheless, perfume is for me, so they can all get stuffed. Literally. With candyfloss and kebabs. I have Coromandel, and, we are in perfect harmony and, for the time being at least, totally in love. Oh Man what a scent. This is awesome. Way masculine. A very smooth spicy scent, not too heavy either. As a man if your tired of the designer line Bleu De Chanel. Try this. This a must buy This is a spicier and woodier Prada Amber to my nose. It's more refined, classier and elegant than Prada. I don't get any white chocolate at all but it's a beautiful fragrance. If you like Amber this is much like the next step up. I like both but Coromandel really has taken it up a notch. Chanel should have named this ""Félicité"" or ""Bliss"". It truly smells like falling in love for the first time, and I don't think it's possible to feel bad while you're wearing it. Oh wow! I was sooo not expecting to like this one. The reviews made me order a sample from ebay, and god thats great! With sillage and lasting power that great, I can definitely see why the price is so high. On my skin that white chocolate note is very present (which I was really hoping for) heavenly blended with benzoin and patchouli...oooh!!! Its not available where I live though, but once I travel somewhere where this liquid magic is available, I'll definitely pick this up! When I first tried Coromandel I rolled my eyes... yeah straight into the back of my head! Absolute patchouli bliss.
Definitely unisex but there are moments in it's development where is leans more feminine and vice verse. The white chocolate seems like an odd choice of note but works really well. It doesn't take it too far into gourmand territory and it adds a nice creaminess to the whole composition. 
Coromandel lasts for a long time but the projection is typical Chanel; it creates an aura around you rather than invading the space of others. And this aura is quite potent for many hours.
I've not tried the EDT but I cannot imagine how it could be superior to this EDP version.
Buy with 100% confidence as this is liquid gold and is one of the rare luxury items that is underpriced in my opinion. Absolutely lovely! It's a classical gem. Reminds me so much of Shalimar, but more delicate to those who can't stomach such heavy scents.
Too bad it's overshadowed by other Chanel perfumes, like Coco Mademosille and Chance, that appeal to the newer generations. What a beauty!!!!
How come not more rave on about this gem? OMG, I think I just died and went to heaven. I love it from beginning till the end. Patchouli wrapped in white chocolate.. Mmmm.. As it seems is tradition, my mother has told me that she'll be buying this for me on (or before) my birthday. I used to own the EDT which was truly gorgeous on me. The EDP, however, is a whole other creature. Holding out to own it again, I'm always going into Chanel and annoying the SAs by squirting a bit on my knuckles or gloves. I've been quite depressed lately and this is really lifting my spirits. The warmth in this is just so irresistible. I sprayed some on my gloves yesterday and I can still smell the patchouli and chocolate. Its lasted longer than the EDT ever did and I need something like that for a fragrance like this. Its blended so meticulously that it's hard to describe it by any other way than 'love'. Woodsy, possibly birch, amber, orris & benzoin are what I get from this mostly. 
This is a rare case of me much preferring the EDP to the EDT. It's heady, but calming and a true 10 out of 10. 
I may call this my signature, if I had enough money to buy my own bottle frequently and not just receive it as a gift every year. Coromandel EDP is lush from beginning to end. While I preferred the earthiness from the EDT, but the EDP presents a more creamy and spicy patchouli accord. Arguably, for many, this is good - more more approachable. Where the EDT was like Fancy Nights, the EdP doesnt strike me as similar to anything. There is this gorgeous supple rose in the dry down that I almost faint when I smell it. 
This is Chanel elegance, and this is superior to any scent I've ever tried. 8ve have had many fragrances and seen even more come and go, this always holds a place in my heart even though I can no longer afford it. Wearing a EDP tester. I've never smelled the EDT version so won't be able to provide info about the differences. 
Well blended and well behaved woody oriental: smells expensive and refined. The woods and incense base last past the 6 hour mark on me. That said, due to the cost I will not be adding to my collection.
I have several that I love in this price range, so even though I really like it I will be passing. If I had to sum up the reason why, I'd say that it smells a little too perfect, and mature. Like this would be an excellent choice for a beautiful woman in her 60s or 70s. I know that might seem abstract, but that's the over all feeling Coromandel gives me. I own and absolutely adore the edt, it is my favorite scent! I’ve been a bit worried about the reform and have wanted to try the edp to compare, and finally had my chance today. So here’s my take: it has changed and it does smell different in the opening. It has a strong medicinal tone to it that caught me off guard, but it does slowly morph into a recognizable form of fragrance I know and love, even if it isn’t totally replicated. The notes are perhaps better blended which for some I suppose is a good thing. I personally prefer to be able to pick out the individual notes through the life of a fragrance. It also doesn’t seem as smooth and creamy- if the Fragrantica pyramids are correct, perhaps the vanilla accord used in the edt was creamier toned than the amber that replaced it for the edp.The verdict: yes, it has noticeably changed especially in the opening, and the scent seems to me to be more linear and less multifaceted. Yes, it is still good. Yes, I will be able to replace my edt with the edp without therapy, because it retains that patchouli meets iced gingerbread thing that drives me crazy and keeps me over spraying (get over it, coworkers). I'm ashamed to say I've never really smelled the EDT version.
However, I've recently been sampling the EDP & today just acquired a 200ml bottle. So far, I'm really digging Coromandel EDP. It's right up my olfactory alley.
Coromandel is an oriental perfume that packs a very serious punch. And I mean this in the best way possible. It doesn't come off as loud or powerful on the first spray, but rather subdued. However, the aroma only intensifies as the minutes go on, and by the 30-45 minute mark, Coromandel is finally at it's peak intensity (on my skin anyway). It smells powdery, smoky, nutty, and balsamic. The ingredients all blend very well together, and the more pronounced notes, such as the patchouli, stay at the top even through the latest phases of the dry down. I apologize if I am sounding too technical at this point, but Coromandel really is the type of scent that commands scrutiny. 
To sum it up: FUCK YES.
This is soo sexy on my skin and even sexier on a woman. It is not made to be liked by the masses, but it is so good that most would like it. You probably won't run into someone in public wearing this either, just because of it's exclusivity. Compliments are just bound to arise when you're wearing this out and about. It smells so scrumptious. 
The sillage is very pleasant and persistent. It is never overwhelming. The longevity is really amazing. People will be able to smell it on you until is is washed off, basically. I go with about 6-7 sprays to satisfy me. Why not? This could be worn in any season, but I would wear it dressed up or at least when I'm not scrubbin' or just hanging out. 
Overall, Coromandel EDP is an excellent offering from Chanel. It is luxurious and intoxicating. It is the highest quality juice in my collection, and is top-shelf worthy. I'd call this a masterpiece. 
Rating: 10/10 Coromandel is very quicly become one of my fevorits . It is now in my top five along with dior homme intense (vintage),Creed SMW, Reflection Man, Amouage Asrar. I've both EDT (2015 batch) and edp (2017 batch). They're closed, however i prefer edp to edt as it is smoother and more mature. It is richer and more complex, all ingredients are well blended and it is now become harder to detect individule notes of its composition than in edt. projection in the latest versions of edt and efp is almost the same.
the newer version of edp is slightly different than 2017 version. It become closer to edt again. Coromandel could be easily one's signiture scent in winter and fall. It could also be applied in summer night.

Masterpiece A lovely fellow fragrantican gave me a sample of this perfume, one I would never have thought to try as patchouli and I aren't really friends.
This leaked a little in my bag and I was in olfactory heaven, a slightly earthy, rich and warm fragrance that would be the absolute antidote to the cold wet weather we suffer in this country. An enveloping air of warm happiness enshrouding you.
I had never smelled such a beautifully blended perfume before and both myself and my bf loved it.
On paper and on my BF it is fantastic, however for some reason on me there is a profoundly sour note. It is just as one commenter mentioned below, my skin seems to turn one of the notes.
The good news is that this eventually dissipates, or at least, becomes much less pronounced after say 20 minutes. It is however very off putting and once noticed is impossible to ""un notice"".
I think patchouli turns quite sour on my skin, its the same with Sisley soir d''orient however the effects are much less pronounced and don't last as long.
It is still a beautiful fragrance, a masterpiece really, starts off incredibly strong with sillage turning to moderate after 30mins, on my skin moderate longevity. Just got it and I'm trying it on for the first time, reaction: I'm loving this right now! 
On my skin Im getting an earthy rose covered in incense and there's definitely something slightly gourmand coming from the chocolate but it's not overly done. 
As I'm writing this review I'm getting more of a citrusy powder and my roommate from the other side of the room just said it smells ""really good""...yeah I'm liking this..
Will have to wait for the drydown... Sampling this today, and despairing that I cannot afford to buy a bottle right this very moment. 
The most intoxicating patchouli I have ever sniffed. It is at once refined and earthy. Held up by the ambery vanillic base it is absolutely enveloping. 
Warmer, cozier and more mellow than any other Chanel I've tried. I completely agree with people who describe this as ""Chanel does Guerlain."" @chillevanille From my experience I would say that your ponderations are spot on. I also have a miniature of Coromandel EDT and I also was slightly out off by some facets of the scent, even though I absolutely loved it. It smelled a bit too aldehydic for my taste, and there was some sourness to it. 
I think the EDP is just well done and they reformulated it very well. I suggest you try it before buying though, because it does smell quite different from the EDT; for me it’s an upgrade but maybe some people may still prefer the EDT version I guess.
x This is a question for those who have tried both the EDT and EDP rather than a true review:
I have a mini of the EDT version and I love how it smells in the bottle and on paper, I still like it on me but my skin makes it a little funky. It gets really warm (I don't like overly warm-makes it smell very oriental and the gourmand white chocolate becomes harder to notice) but at the same time the patchouli gets damp, almost a little mildewy? Before my skin does a number on it, it smells cool and crisp with a delicious white chocolate note. The drydown is much better but I would love if the top notes worked on me too. Might I have better luck with the new EDP?
Also, since I have the dab bottle I can't put it on my clothes, so take in to consideration that if I got a bottle/decant of the EDP, I could just spray it on my clothes. Autumn evening spent in a French orangery.
You´re just sitting by a Chinese carved lacquer tea table, eating handmade truffles /made of white Belgian chocolate & with vanilla filling/ & juicy pieces of fresh orange. And you can sense & smell humid air from outside. It brings you whiffs of sweet smoke, a scent of red roses & wet ground. Yes, autumn is finally here.

This is it. 
I tried Coromandel EDT many times and pondered for years (literally, YEARS) whether:
1) is too feminine for me, a man?
2) is it too pricey?
3) wtf is this sour ending note?
Now all my doubts have vanished.
The new EDP reformulation is just stunning. The patchouli is much more rounded and the base notes are powdery and warm, not slightly sour as in the EDT, which I also loved btw.
I am buying this and it will become my signature scent.
It is pricey but it’s also long lasting so I feel like it might not be such a bad deal after all. 
This fragrance is timeless, gorgeous, unisex, perfect for every season, effortlessly sophisticated. 
By far my favorite Chanel and definitely one of my favorite fragrances ever. I wasn't sure what to expect from this when I purchased a mini bottle. The white chocolate note intrigued me, and the orris root made me think this might be similar to Britney Spears Naughty Fantasy Remix. It kind of is similar! Naughty Fantasy is much stronger though and doesn't have many notes that this one does.
...which is why it surprised me that this is not as strong as I thought/hoped. Not to say it isn't a gorgeous fragrance. It smells SO good. It's not an edible chocolate, but just something that warms up the composition even more. It's a cozy, warm, skin scent, but lasts forever. This is obviously much more complex than Britney Spears, and isn't even comparable beyond the white chocolate & orris root combo. The patchouli and incense make this slightly smoky and herbal. All around a wonderfully blended scent that is very elegant and classy. Perhaps I don't find this to be so strong since I have a dabber bottle and find that many scents perform not as strongly when dabbed vs. atomized/sprayed. I hope I didn't get a fake! It definitely is strong sniffing out of the bottle. I think it just melds so well with people's skin chemistry that it isn't an IN-YOUR-FACE fragrance, but one that envelopes you in its warmth and exudes an aura of comfort and refinement. I think I might decant some of it into an atomizer to see if that helps. Beautiful beautiful dry down, sweet powdery comforting scent, I love this one, never bores me at all, one of the great collection of Les Exclusifs, it kind of reminds me of my aunt in Jakarta who likes to apply 'Purol' body powder after she showered with sandalwood and honey Chinese soap bar.
There again.. all those lovely fragrances that always evoke your deepest buried memories I just tried this for the first time and do not understand why people say that it's not suitable for men. It just smells really damn good. I don't get any overtly masculine or feminine vibes. Definitely more wearable by men than Boy is کرماندل عطری خیلی خوشبو و ملایم و دوست داشتنی است
اصلا آزار دهنده نیست و همه پسند است و فکر نکنم هیچ کس از این عطر بدش بیاد
بسیار مناسب برای فصل پاییز و زمستان است
یک کم کفه ترازو به سمت خانوم ها متمایل است ولی در عین حال آقایان هم میتوانند به راحتی استفاده کنند
از اون عطر هایی است که هر وقت نمیدونید از چه عطری استفاده کنید و متحیر هستید میاد تو ذهنتون I tried this in EDT a few years ago, to me this was a scrubber , far too screechy and strong for me .
Fast forward to a few weeks ago , I got two sample bottles of the new EDP , finished them both and bought the biggest bottle available.
The is so much rounder and deeper and just absolutely gorgeous , I have been wearing it exclusively since I first got the samples. The dry down is just absolutely heavenly .. sweat and resinous to my nose . I get wifs of the white chocolate here and there every now and again. Stunning in every way . I Also Love the mentholly opening , has the same smell as the original ""Lip Ice"" Flavour.
If you didn't like the EDT , try the new EDP .. you WILL fall in love ! Coromandel EDP
I had a huge trepidation trying Coromandel. I heard it was close to Fancy Nights, something I down wright loathed and put Coromandels exploration on the back burner. Come to find out, they arent related at all.
I feel everything has been pretty much accurately covered regarding the nuts and bolts making up Coromandel, so Im going to take a birdwalk to expand this a bit in a few different directions.
I first sprayed Coromandel, It felt slightly familiar. Matriarch's CoCo Blanc came to mind in its milky chai vanilla wood feel. 1932 edt also resonated with me with its sweet woody vanillic base once again is used in Coromandel, as is the orris note. Angel sprung to mind with its chocolaty patchouli. 
Coromandel is indeed beautiful and well done, and it strikes me with its oilbanum, patchouli, orris, and musky woods as a very creamy base driven scent. I might get a full bottle not only for the fact this absolutely blew my doors off as a great scent, but I suspect there is much more to it than this..I think it could also be a tremendous layering component to those that do like to layer and blend their fragrances. I cant wait to layer this under my orientals I already have in my collection. I finally have a whole bottle, yay! What's to say? It's a masterpiece. It's a lot like Prada Amber but less herbaceous, more powdery and warm.
I get far more olibanum than benzoin, tonnes of patchouli, sweet creamy vanilla which I guess is white chocolate and powder. But, of course, it's more complex than it sounds. Rich, balsamic, heady. It's the perfect scent for me. It's like Obsession but far more refined and fresh and of course without the spiciness which is, in part, what makes it so refined. I am a man who appreciates and is thankful for this fragrance classic timeless elegance that just moves me like no other. Add to that its in your face sophisticated patchouli / incense combined with extraordinary longevity and silage and you have in my opinion one of the most well blended unisex scents ever, without the cloying synthetic nose that accompanies many including some of the male specific from Chanel. It's wide range and versatility covers from utmost utmost formal to nice casual and every season but hot summer. All I need are about four incredible fragrances and I am pleased to claim this as one of them! If you have not tried a sample you must to see if it is right for you! I sprayed this on my hand at Nieman Marcus yesterday and the first citrus and airy, powdery,sweet notes reminds me a little of Shalimar and the rose, jasmine, and a powdery bite, a little of Chanel No 5. However there is a strong camphorish, minty, almost mentholated note that is never too strong or medicinal but definitely present and dominating in the heart notes although it is tempered very well with light woods, amber, and rounded off by a non-sweet airy powdery vanilla. It's a very well balance, elegant, and ""full"" fragrance. I sniffed the tester wands for several of the Chanel Les Exclusifs line and was very impressed by all their offerings, the whole collection struck me as masterfully done. I will totally buy this once I can afford the largest bottle. I did not want to try EdT (now discontinued), because I thought it was too strong and sweet. And I do not like patchouli, so it was a no go for me. 
Then I heard that the new EdP was softer, more rounded and patchouli in it was not so strong, so I tried it. 
This is a really nice perfume, although I do not think it's too original. Reminds me of something already seen, some perfumes from the past with a typical ultra-elegant Chanel signature. As somebody said, that could be some new Coco Blanche, and I certainly smell in it echoes of Shalimar, Opium before the reformulation, but also mild, much more wearable Angel. It is a true unisex perfume, although you do not have to worry that it is not feminine enough. Durability is very good and sillage is sensational. 
I am glad that this perfume for me is somehow a time-track through the past, reminding me of some of the most beautiful perfumes from the golden perfume era, with a modern, elegant Chanel touch. The first time I tried this I didn't like it at all.
I felt the incense smoke and benzoin were bursting too sharply well pass the opening. I also found it leathery in a harsh way.
But hours later I felt the drydown was pleasant.
Wearing it again, I didn't find the incense so strong and felt it was quite pleasant as well. These notes (incense, benzoin, leather) give this perfume an originality that is lacking in all the mainstream products and even in other Chanel Exclusifs. 
The drydown this time came sooner in a powdery, sweet (but never tiring nor cloying) way.
I also felt the white cholocate note.
This is gorgeous, I guess the first time it just surprised me in the opening. 
I looooove the drydown specially, and I will try to get a bottle ASAP, despite the steep price, I feel it's worth it.
Sophisticated, elegant, nice! The classiest stay home from work to go out and play scent ever I'll get the blasphemy out of the way first: I DO see some similarity to JS Fancy Nights. On the bottle and upon first spritz, I bemoaned that I had in my possession a $200 clone of a $10 celeb scent that you can find on clearance at just about any given TJ Maxx. And yes, that would be an ironically appropriate penance for someone who blind buys shit this expensive, but...
It doesn't stay that way for long, and even while it does, it is so, SO much better. Coromandel is a reference patchouli scent, in my opinion. As we all know, patchouli has a deserved reputation for smelling like a musty hippie shop; Coromandel, on the other hand, is patchouli done in the most luxe possible way. It smells, as many Chanels do, like the epitome of good taste. Or, if you prefer, like MONEY. The fruits in the opening are bright and interesting in juxtaposition to the smoooooth, somewhat dark patchouli, but Coromandel's money shot, for me, is that smokiness from the base. I don't really smell anything that I would identify as white chocolate until the far drydown, but my nose is certainly no expert. 
Coromandel is a timeless smelling oriental that leans to the feminine side of unisex; women that love orientals but find that some of them turn quite masculine have nothing to fear here, and men who enjoy sweet scents will be in heaven. Rich, earthy and creamy. Coromandel is dirty and delicate at the same time, rough and soft. Comforting and naughty... Lusty and luxurious, like a passionate embrace of a lover.
Well blended and long lasting. A beautiful dirty and sexy fragrance. creamy, smooth, silky, clean but dirty all at the same time. the most complex smell ive ever put my nose on. Today is 10 years I've been using Coromandel. It's opulent, aristocratic, glossy and perfectly executed piece of art. I am very, very disappointed in Chanel for messing with this masterpiece. It is still great quality and beautifully blended but, to me, one the characteristics that set Coromandel apart from other orientals was the contrast between the earthy patchouli in the opening that gradually turned into a sweet and warm amber. Not only the patchouli has been relegated to the background, but this composition is linear from beginning to end, so you never get a chance to fully enjoy it. I am not even sure I would still classify this as an oriental woody anymore. Maybe an oriental vanilla?
I am also quite disappointed in the performance. The previous iteration was unbelievable. If I sprayed Coromandel EdT on a card, the card would smell for MONTHS! And if I sprayed it on my skin, it would still be there until I took a shower the next day. I need several sprays of the EdP to get any kind of longevity, which really shocked me seeing how it is supposedly more concentrated, and it still doesn’t even come close to the original.
I do not know if there is such a scarce supply of patchouli that Chanel was forced to reformulate this fragrance and then decided to change the concentration so that the ""tweaks"" would not be so noticeable; or if all this was just an excuse to charge considerably more per bottle. But, in any case, it is an utter shame.
Again, it does NOT smell awful by any means. Far from it! I own a bottle of the EdP and will continue using it. Also, from what I have read in the comments, many people actually prefer this version and have not experienced any hindrance in performance. I am very jealous of these people because, unfortunately, I can't help but feel extremely sad. I did a comparison of Coromandel edt and the edp. Edt is sharper and imho a lot better. 
Those who know me know my complete love for Coromandel edt - it's one of my favourite fragrances and I confess I'm addicted to it, I wear it often and know it very well. I know every note, every angle, I know the bones of edt to the point that if I catch a whiff of it on someone (which rarely happens) I feel compelled to put some on as soon as I can. It's a delight, rich, sweet/sharp and note perfect. 
The edp is good, very very good and I will undoubtedly buy a fb at some point but whilst it's extremely similar to the edt it is not in the same league as my beloved. 
The Edp is smooth, it's obviously Chanel and it shares a lot of the edt DNA- but for me edp is a sister, not a twin. 
Still fb worthy though. And yes I do love it, I'm just not IN love with it - that special love is reserved for my edt. Wow, this is gorgeous. Something old, something new. Very well made. I have no other words except that I am loving this. Definitely would like a FB. <3 I bought the EDP recently. It is mellow, sweet but not toothachingly and the patchouli is there but not overpowering. Perfect for a chilly/cold weather, elegant and cozy and the same time. So I compared this with the original coromandel today.
Original has more patchouli and to me a patchouli that is similar to A men. Plus more wood.
This is softer, more feminine yet not as sweet.
It is smooth yet powdery and has a distinct bitterness.
Florals and incense notes are more noticeable. 
I feel that this smells more like a ""chinese lacquered screen"" than the original does.
Love it just as much.
(some similarities with shalimar) The EDP.
It leans further into the Feminine by rounding off the rough Edges. Longevity is diminished. Complexity is slightly curbed.
Still a Chanel Masterpiece. beauty beyond words. This fragrance is lovely. It is similar to Shalimar with less incense, no leather and instead white chocolate and Benzoin. The white chocolate adds a more modern feel but this fragrance still has that vintage oriental feeling. To be honest I find the Patchouli quite tame and hidden in this fragrance which is a huge plus since I am not a Patchouli fan. Such a sweet and indulgent concoction Coromandel is. It almost defies words how beautiful I find this fragrance. For my tastes, this is the absolute ideal perfume: saccharine sweet, woody, and balsamic all in one. It is somewhat of a lovechild of my two favorite fragrances---Shalimar and Angel. What more could I wish for?
I'm completely enamored by the prominence of benzoin, which in other fragrances of the same family I find myself in love with, but Coromandel more so than others. The white chocolate, however, is the most prominent note to my nose, which I find makes it so unique---certainly the most outstanding from all of the Exclusifs in my opinion. I absolutely adore Chanel's exclusive blends, but to me Coromandel is one of the rarities which actually smells like it's worth nearly $400. Even though I prefer the sharper patchouli / orange opening of the EdT, this is still the Coromandel I fell in love with many years ago.
It seems to be a bit rounder, fuller then before. I do miss the complete shift from opening to drydown of the EdT though. That was really amazing. I kept sniffing my hand to see at what stage it was.
Therefore I'll treasure my nearly finished bottle and backup bottle of the EdT. By the time these are finished I'll be happy though to purchase a bottle of the EdP. It's the first EdP of the Les Exclusifs I've tried that's worth the insane pricetag.
All hail Coromandel!!
10/10 a perfect 10/10 If you want a standalone review of this fragrance, just read all the reviews (including mine) on the EDT page. All I'm doing here is offering reassurance about the new EDP, because I guess if you're reading this page, it's likely you're trying to find out if the old EDT is still recognisable within the new, refo'd EDP.
Well, worry not, it most certainly is. As a long-time wearer of Coromandel, I have just tested the EDT (newish version, bought last year) against the new EDP, one on each hand, identical amounts. Verdict? Extremely similar, and both very definitely Coromandel.
The best way to explain what little difference there is, is to say that the EDP is simply slightly richer. The EDT projects its top minty-patchouli notes quite a lot in proportion to the rest of its composition (so in comparison to the EDP it appears to have less depth as it dries down). The EDP's minty-patchouli top notes are as strong as the EDT's, but its mid and base notes are more pronounced; this means the top notes can sometimes feel proportionally weaker.
I also found that the EDP definitely lingered longer than the EDT. I've always found the longevity of the EDT to be pretty good, especially for a Chanel Exclusif, so for the EDP to out-perform it is actually quite good going.
So, all is as it should be in the land of Coromandel: the top notes are more noticeable in the EDT, while the EDP has a deeper, longer-lasting drydown. But both have the same notes and follow the same progression / development, in my opinion -- any differences are infinitesimal... although, fragonerds that we are, we are always happy to spend many hours dissecting these differences anyway. ;-) Absolutely incredible.... Master work...I love it Simply this fragrance embodies perfection.
Although they were (and still are) many skeptical opinions about migrating Chanel Exclusifs to the EDP concentration, at least in this case we are talking about a significant improvement.
Compared to EDT version, EDP is more ""reserved"" and abstract, something that characterizes Chanel culture.
If in EDT the notes of white chocolate, patchouli, rose and citruses are, somehow, succeeding one after another, EDP is an abstract composition, and perfume is linear - all notes are present simultaneously in all stages.
Longevity is impressive - similar to EDT, but the projection was much lower (patchouli note was a bit in excess in EDT), a situation which gave the impression of some reviewers that Coromandel became a mainstream product.
I think the current version of Coromandel could be even more successful and in the near future would look good in the ""Coco"" family, as ""Coco Blanche"".
Fragrance 10/10
Projection Medium
Longevity 12 h The benzoin in this one is very reminiscent of a tonka bean kind of vanilla. Perhaps it’s the “white chocolate” that does it. I don’t really get that much of the patchouli; perhaps it’s also in there with what I mainly get: a “tonka bean” kind of scent that’s rather too strong to be wearable except in close quarters. I bought a bottle of the EdP yesterday, and had the chance to compare it to the latest formulation of the EdT, as the shop had one tester left. To my nose the EdT was more watery, weaker, more transparent, as if it was a body spray or hair mist edition of the real stuff. I am also acquainted with the old formulation of the EdT, and the EdP is much closer to that version than the latest EdT. Thus, lovers of the old formula of Coromandel: rejoice, it is back in all its amazing glory. Unlike most others, I actually found the oddly screechy white-chocolate opening of the EdT quite fascinating (therefore I prefer) compared to the EdP that made me go ""Is this Coromandel!?""
However, after they settle, the similarity is at least 95%; the EdP is more resinous--thicker & warmer--while the EdT has more patchouli & white-choc, and feels more young-ladylike. I find this very similar to the EDT, at least after the first 10 minutes. The top notes are oddly different (I may like the EDP more at this stage), but the heart and base are more similar than different. Once it starts drying down, the EDT I had (version from a few years ago) has more of the patchouli pungency to it than the new EDP; whereas, the EDP is more ambery. I do miss the extra patch (although it sounds like that was already toned down in the newer EDT versions), but it's still recognizable as Coromandel and ""scratches the itch"" for me. I do think the EDP is slightly weaker than my old EDT, but I'm not sure if that's possibly just due to aging/evaporation in my old EDT. Maybe this will deepen/strengthen as it ages? All in all, I'm not disappointed with the new version and am just happy it's still smells pretty much like the version I fell in love with.
(Edit on 6/11/18: So far, no deepening/strengthening of the juice in the bottle, which honestly has left me pretty disappointed. It’s not that this isn’t a lovely perfume, but it smells more “mass market” to me than the EDT did. I feel like the new guard at Chanel is perhaps sacrificing personality for wider palatability. I had slowly been collecting most of the Exclusifs prior to the EDP reformulation, but have stopped. They’re still well-made, just no longer to my taste...I need to see a bit of off-kilter-ness to really love something.) a very well-made perfume I will be buying a bottle of this. I have the edt. and love it. But this is every bit as good if not better. So glad I did not buy a back up edt. The notes are a little brighter and I get more White Chocolate in the edp. and the amber is more pronounced. I think they dry down about the same. I wore them together the last few times so I could distinguish the differences. But the top of the edp is glorious. I cannot get this soon enough maybe this week end coming. once i smelled it i fell in love with it and became an addict to me, 
it is very vibrant and imposing asd it make the one who wears it a lady, an elegant lady,
it is very intense and strong and it has a powdery undertone that lasts a lot and that you can smell everywhere,
the woody part pf is is well amalgamated it with the cirus note and they both float in a very nice harmony.
it is professionally blended with all compatible extremes, patchouli and benzoin with the white choclate hidden fragrance.
a very nice choice as a gift or for special windy nights I am reviewing the EDT, I have never smelled EDP, so not sure how much they differ...I smelled it on an elegant lady, it is a mature, grown up scent, sophisticated ,I do have a decant home, and what I like the most about Coromandel is the aromatic vibe, I think it has a deep warm undertone, must be the frankincense, but the floral and fruity notes keep it from becoming an over the top spicy scent...the vibe is classy floral oriental, but not overdone...
Then the part I like less is more masculine, and the heart reminds me of my grandfather ' s cologne, he was a banker with refined taste, and the smell stays refined, but more clearly masculine..I would swear I smell lavender too...it has also a strong soapy undertone...luxury soap of course...I admire the beauty in Coromandel, but I couldn't pull it off, it isn't what I like to wear, but I really find it vacillates easily and charmingly between feminine and masculine throughout its development..I has also a definite yet classy sexiness...nothing too much out there, just a hint...it isn't easy to wear and it isn't for everybody...
Liking it, enjoying reviewing it...maybe in the dead of our Canadian winter, I might try to wear it..as it develops a nice sweetness on my skin...! Just received my new EDP Coromandel , and it's not fair yet to write a review but I am so excited about it. 
First of all it's not different. At least not to my nose. So there might be slight changes but I don't know it well enough to recognize them. I had the Edt years ago and to me this is the same smell. Again it might be tweaked but I wouldn't know this. Says , going by fragrantica , that the musk aspect is higher here and that there is no vanilla !? And that it's more woody as well that now amber is present. Well amber to my nose was always one of the top notes in coromandel along with patchouli , how was it not listed before ? I don't know. None of that is true in my opinion. I do have samples of the edt as she sent them along with my EDP bottle. I am wearing them side by side. Maybe the EDPis a little more intense and lasts longer. I bet that might be true. 
About the fragrance , it's a stunner ! You have to like patchouli in order to love coromandel. 
I find it very classy yet it really suits a very cool chick , leather jacket and boots , attitude and all. How is this possible as classy doesn't go hand in hand with a cool chick !? I don't know but it's just how it is. Maybe a classy cool chick. A rich girl that grew up to be a rebbel at heart but leads a high class life but has a rebellous side to her. Maybe a hidden one. 
Coromandel reminds me of Calamity J by JHAG , another favourite of mine. Another rebbel perfume. Also reminds me of Patchouli imperiale by Dior. As well as prada Amber and Inez and Vinoodth by Byredo and yes yes i do agree with some of you ,,,ANGEL !!!! Never thought of this before until I read it in quite many reviews. A classy Angel , without the fruits. More refined , wealthier , a little more class. Like someonone mentiones ,,,sisters , one that grew up to be wealthy , married into money and attends charity fundraisers. And then the younger sister Angel who is still nothing but a rebbel , but has a good heart .... 
Coromandel is a very well blended , well rounded patchouli amber vanilla fragrance , it smells a little medical , which I quite like. I think of bandaids here and there but in a good way ! Also I think of mint leaves and chocolate , I will add to this review after wearing it for a few days strait. 
Stay tuned !"
9,4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex)," Smells very decadent, makes you want to walk the walk while others absorb your aura. Very pathetic sillage and lasting effect. It just builds you up to let you down!!! I keep a bottle in the bathroom and splash everytime I wash. It’s fresh and lovely but just doesn’t last. A great quick pick me up scent! Classic! This is so yummy. It’s basically Orange Blossom Water, the same stuff in lebanese deserts! I bought my 100ml splash bottle during a visit to the eponymus flagship store in Cologne while looking for the Farina Cologne Museum - for some reasons I took the former for the latter and was disappointed to see a scentless eau de cologne fountain as the sole attraction!
4711 is the shortest-lived fragrance ever, I think - if it lasts more than 15 minutes on my skin, it's a lucky day - but those 15 minutes are really glorious: a blast of citruses, truly invigorating, mixed with the dark floral sweetness of rose and jasmine, and rounded up with some subtle earthy notes (which I think come from the oakmoss, that even at IFRA concentration, must be über-strong compared to everything else). 
Useless as a scent as many intend it today (super projection, everlasting longevity, possibly choking everyone else in the room), the original 4711 is a wonderful fabric scent, or a superb olfactory comfort when you need to smell something nice, clean and invigorating. Strong like also considering its incredibly cheap price. I would love to try some of the flankers in their line and maybe owning one of the 800ml bottle just for the sake of it. If you plan to use it for real, though, do yourself a favour and buy one of the spray bottles - not the splash ones!
Little known fact: Mr Farina and his family were originally from Val Vigezzo, a narrow valley joining the upper tip of Piedmont in Italy to Locarno in Switzerland; there, another local herbalist, Mr Feminis, is said to have invented the first original formulation of a cologne, then called ""aqua mirabilis"", by using locally sourced herbs and flowers, before Farina took it to Cologne and, from there, then across the continent. Val Vigezzo's capital city, Santa Maria Maggiore, hosts a small perfume museum where the story of eau de cologne is explained, and they still sell in the town the original ""Acqua di Colonia - Feminis-Farina"". I bought a 25ml splash bottle and it has a pronounced herbaceous and aromatic (rosemary & lavander) opening mixed with tuned-down citruses, along with a soapy/powdery facet coming up immediately after. It's in a way more masculine and old-fashioned than 4711, but still with similar longevity problems. If you ever happen to be there, it's worth trying - also, the valley is just magnificent. 4711 - I mean what can I really say - ICONIC 
This has been around longer than any of us! I remember smelling this on my granddad, he always had a bottle of this.
This is a great pick me up / after the shower / mood booster 
I also use it to spray my bed linen, cushions, curtains...I will literally spray anything and everything with this. 
Yes it's weak, no it doesn't last and yes I really wish it did. But that's the beauty of it I guess.
It will disappear within 30 minutes. This is not a perfume and for that price you really can't ask for anything more. 
Just carry a bottle in your bag and cake it on every hour !!! Zaleska, 
I think that Jean Marie Farina his cologne Farina, had made in 1709, whilst Muehlens his 4711 made in 1792...
kind regards è come un eiaculazione precoce , pochi secondi e finisce tutto . amen I know my question may sound a bit silly, but here it goes:
Which came first: 4711 or Jean Marie Farina Extra Vieille Roger & Gallet?
I know 4711 was lauched before, but many perfume reviewers stress that JMF's is the first EDC just because it was...officially registrated in Cologne, Germany.
Please, help this poor soul. I was hoping this would be a very light and refreshing scent that I could overly spray throughout the day as a pick-me-up in hot & sweaty NYC summers. However I pick up an herbal scent that is to me is not very appealing and makes it smell almost medicinal. Unfortunately that scent is equally as potent as the citrus, and lingers. 
I’m a bit preemptive to that summer weather as I write this, but I have a feeling of doubt my thoughts on this fragrance will change unfortunately. We shall see... but for the price, I have very low regrets on the purchase and am sure I’ll find a use for it. My ex bf in college wore this. His father was French and lived in France, and he'd visit his dad every summer. I mention this because there is history and nostalgia for me in this scent, but also because French can be snobs about perfume (rightfully so in many cases), and it passed the test in the case of the old bf's family... and this is a German-born scent!
I have the jumbo 27oz bottle for $40 on Amazon. It will last a looong time. But this is a classic and it will be used!
I love the neroli, which stands out nicely, and is softened by everything else, of which nothing else really stands out for me. As others have mentioned, it's not super potent, and, IMO, it has better longevity in the summer than winter. This is a true toilet water, the old school kind, like aftershave splash. I don't consider it the same class of parfum/cologne scents popular today. This comes from another time, another era (early 18th C), when dousing yourself in smell was improper/sacrilege? IDK the history of perfume, but I'd imagine that scents were worn more heavy in the 16th C than in the 17th C when people began to bathe. Anyway, read the wiki article on it, there is an interesting history. 
I don't consider 4711 in the same category with my JM Basil Neroli, or my Chloe Eau de Fleurs Neroli, which I consider feminine, nor would I align it with the more masculine TF Neroli Portofino, nor Creed's Neroli Sauvage. Why? The oldest of these scents is from 1994! Hardly a realistic comparison to a 300yo perfume!!! These newer scents are all more potent, more expensive, and more readily relevant for our contemporary use/trends/needs. Most people leave a scent trail once they pass you these days. I don't think that was the intent or reality back in the day. If you sat close at tea you could smell another person, and it would cover any stink, but you know, it was another time. Love 4711 for what it is. Atypical review, as I don't really wear this as a fragrance.
I came upon 4711 a few years ago, looking for something Neroli-Portofino-Esque. TOO MANY people name this as a suitably similar bargain option and I firmly disagree. If that's what you're looking for, I highly suggest getting a dupe fragrance oil instead. There are some really great ones available, with longevity that puts Tom Ford to shame. But I digress.
4711 is a summer staple for me, but I apply it under my arms along with crystal mineral deodorant, or later in the day after I've sweat a bit but am not ready for a shower. The citrus and alcohol content in this is incredible at inhibiting bacterial growth and neutralizing some of that ""hot weather musk"" that may develop with a more natural hygiene routine (read: no chemical deodorizers or antiperspirants). 4711 also has the added benefit of many other pleasant fragrance additions and the overall effect is one of refreshment. It's very sharp and tart for a few seconds and then fades off to a pleasant near-nothingness, so wearing this as a traditional cologne is sort of futile. But under my arms it smells a bit like froot loops for some reason, and that makes me chuckle.
Don't buy this looking to quell the craving for Tom Ford though, and don't buy this if you're looking for something with any kind of longevity. But if you want to splash it under your arms or all over after a shower for a quick wake-up pick-me-up, definitely go for it. I don't plan on ever being without this one. I purchased this today as my refresher quarantine fragrance. Pretty straightforward, beautiful yet fleeting. I might have purchased because of the hyped up nostalgia and the beautiful bottle ( and I do agree with the previous reviewer that although cheap,---compared to other fragrances, I could have purchased a better EDC with better performance) 
Once my refill bottle is empty, I shall refill it with another better performing cologne (LOL)
Don't get me wrong! this is definitely a classic and a must have for collectors in their archive ( but it isn't a necessity hehe, did I just contradict myself?) 
I'll test this on clothes if it lasts longer.
OK UPDATE:(3/30/21) PLEASE DISREGARD MY PREVIOUS, SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE REVIEW. 
I am now obsessed with this! I've been wearing this 2 days straight ( probably for the entire week-- the weather in Manila now is scorching) , and the simplicity of this is just uplifting. 
When sprayed underneath and on clothes I get slightly longer wear and this delicious airy effect which I look for in colognes. The basic construction of this cologne is where it's beauty lies. It doesn't scream, it is subdued and sultry and just refreshing. It leaves my skin smelling naturally clean. No acidic-pee-like drydown which I get from some concentrated EDCs. 
I also spray it on my hands and inhale as indicated on the box and it's a just a simple luxurious treat! I feel more positive and energized and inspired. 
Now let me order an 800 ml. I will never be without this forever. Just got this in the mail today, and I am glad I only got the 50ml bottle. First, yes - it does smell similar to TF Neroli Portofino, no doubt. But the scent is gone in a few minutes. My bottle doesn't have a spray nozzle either, so this is going to be used as a hand sanitizer most likely. 
Where I live, this is not as cheap as many of the reviewers say, so I really regret this purchase since I could have gotten a better fragrance for the same price. You live and you learn! I have no nostalgic connections to anyone using 4711 in my family or amongst my friends, so the sentimental value of this is not there for me. Once this bottle is done, I will never buy it again :) Interesting comments about the brief but pleasant hit & the ""training wheels"" aspect of frag-centric matriarchs preparing their daughters for olfactory adventures future.
When I was a little kid I vividly remember a TV ad that aired every summer. The hook-line & theme, 4711: ""It's as Cold as Ice"".
It was deliciously politically incorrect by today's norm.
It featured various over-heated characters exalting the virtues of the brew. 
There was a trucker leaning out the window of his truck, dripping in sweat, saying; in reference to the heat: ""When I can't take no more""....then he'd use 4711 'wipes' on his face & neck, 
Another was a busty, Benny Hill-esque young woman saying she kept hers (4711 purse spray) in the fridge. She would spray it on her very camera focused decolletage & 'giggle & jiggle' whilst exclaiming: ""ooooooh!"".
I think every kid in the industrial world encounters a bottle on their Mum's dresser. And many an ancestor going way, way back. 
Not far back enough to be in the cargo holds of the Mayflower or First Fleet, et al, but still no doubt one of the 1st frags to be exported out of Europe to new frontiers in bulk. Fragrance quality: 9/10 (according to the price of course).
Longevity: 5/10
Price: 10/10
4711 Original Eau de Cologne On my skin last from 1 hour to 4 hours. It is a great spring/summer fragrance indeed, it reminds me of another neroli cheapie Just Jack Neroli.
It is a great fragrance for the price, no doubt about that. Yes, it doesn't last long but there are lots of fragrances that cost way more and last the same or even worse. 10 seconds of pure and simple pleasure. Absolutely perfect. My very first scent, I must have been 6 years old. I was always fascinated by my nana's vanity. She gave 4711 to me. She said this was the best place to start. Fresh yet layered. This is where my love for citrus, jasmine, and sandalwood comes from. Simply a classic. Got this for my husband (he wanted something citrusy and refreshing), ended up using it myself. He says it disappears within 5 minutes, which he minds (as he leaves for a full work day every day) and I don't (because I'm studying from home). I don't mind respraying 100x a day, to me every application is a delight. Fresh, invigorating, awakening, rejuvenating. Absolutely great for drained mornings when no amount of coffee will do. This is pure aromatherapy, I can definitely see the appeal. I'm happy I have this. 30 minutes scent..... though pleasant and fresh I bathe myself in this every time I get out of the shower or before going to bed. It’s that good. 
I also kind of like that it’s longevity is nonexistent; that means that you can spray it 15 times on your body, experiencing 20 seconds of pure bliss and then smelling it fade away in the following 20 minutes.
I can’t believe I was using Tom Ford Neroli Portofino before this. NP is a bit more complex (but is it really? Or do you just have more time to detect all the notes?) and ofc lasts more, but is it worth spending, quite literally, 10 times more? My favourite way to use 4711 is to sprinkle some on freshly changed bedding. The lasting power is fleeting on skin, but it stays on my linen for days and makes getting into bed feel like a little luxury every night. I also like using it on my curtains as it gently scents the whole room and doesn't discolour the fabric. Love this stuff and will never be without it, even though I seldom use it as personal fragrance. I have the 800ml of this one. Great price and such a classic smell, reminisce of myself at the local barbershop during my childhood days. Great splash on after shower on hot summer days and nights. This historic cologne has the most glorious fragrance, and somehow manages to be calming and revitalizing at the same time. It's great for soothing headaches, rubbing on tense muscles, and just generally freshening up. The only way 4711 could possibly be better is if the fragrance lasted longer on skin, but then that's not really in its job description. I really need this in my stash at all times! This is one of my favorite fragrances. Awful longevity, but I don't care. This is a true ""cologne"". Very fresh, very clean, very well - blended, and refreshing. I bought a 90mL with atomizer because I prefer spraying to splashing a bunch of fragrance into my hand and applying it. I would recommend buying a huge 800mL bottle and decant it into the 90 mL with an atomizer so you can say a whole bunch of money. Great price, great value for a gigantic bottle. Buy it if you are a classic man who likes to apply fragrance after a shower and before sleep. Don't buy it if you don't want to smell like an old German grandma. I personally love it. Love this. 
When a barber offers you a splash of something after a trim, to perk you up, it ought to be this. It isn't meant to last long. Something to add a zing to your morning. Little boosts during the day and evening, then to settle you in after your bedtime wash. Serves nicely as a fleeting aftershave too It does not last long, but it is a nice lemon scent. Fresh and nice. I love it and sometimes spray it around the house One of my first ever fragrances i purchased when i was still a scholar in Primary School, it was a scent i would splash on straight after i got dressed up, and i would throw the mini bottle into my bag to freshen up through the day, i never knew much about fragrances back then but what i did know was that this fragrance was a great revitalization scent, it instantly woke me up ready to take school on and whatever it entailed, through the years i have become accustomed to more scents and now 4711 still a scent i purchase every single summer despite its abysmal longevity, but hey its a cologne and its not meant to last long but merely realign your sense into woke mode, and this splashed onto your body with a few good spritz of your summer cologne of choice and you are good to go, it is not a holy grail perfume, but there is a reason this scent is still around since 1792, it is a summer must have staple for anybody and everybody and will remain so until worlds end.
Sillage- Its a cologne so do not even bother
Longevity- 2 hours skin scent max
Uniqueness- It is a modern classic till now, copied to death but none comes close to the awakening this gives you.
Rating 7/10 not a love due to it being a cologne but a must have staple for every guy and girl to freshen up. 4711 is a great fragrance for what it does: refreshes after, or in lieu of, a shower with a blast of citrus and floral. I like to splash it on first thing in the morning or on a warm afternoon to freshen up and revive myself.
I’m also a fan of applying to a handkerchief or bandana on sweaty days. The fresh scent is invigorating and restorative for someone like me who sweats profusely and doesn’t care for humidity.
4711 is a citrusy EDC, so don’t use like a men’s cologne and expect a long-lasting fragrance. It’s all about freshening up, and it does the job well and at a good price.
By comparison, I also have a bottle of the Guerlain EDC du Coq, and it’s basically a more linear version of 4711—pure citrus, with even less longevity. So, 4711 holds its own in this specific fragrance genre.
I believe generations of Europeans have been using this stuff to freshen up in the afternoon with a splash or a dab on a handkerchief, and they really know what they’re doing. Anyone interested in fragrances should start here and get a feel for an original—the reason many of us call it “cologne.” as many others stated before ... the lack of silage and longevity makes this cologne an EXCELLENT option as an after shave lotion ... this is a known ""secret"" within the wet shave community Wet, this smells exactly like duck toilet disks. It's slightly nicer when dry, but I can't get past the duck toilet disks smell. It smelled a bit nicer on my partner, more sweet neroli, but still nothing to write home about. Will try again during the warmer months! I love it, I use it after shaving This is the original, less nuanced, less expensive version of neroli portofino. I keep a small 3 oz bottle of it at my desk in my home office. I use it frequently. This is a staple perfume. 4711 has spiritually protective uses and it is also useful for refreshing the mind. It's not meant to last for a long time. I splash some on the back of my neck after washing up for bed. When I move my hair around, I always smell the rose and jasmine notes dried on my hair. I would love to purchase the scented tissues and the gift set. classy citrus cologne - still the same DNA like 300 years ago ... love it! I didn't expect this to smell good, but for me it is smelling good. It smells like a classic old cologne. I think it suits very well for older people. Blind buy based on reviews and I have to say that I absolutely hate it. It reminds me of window cleaner or some other harsh chemical smell. I wear many different fragrances but I can literally feel the start of a terrible headache coming from this one. I had to change my clothes to get rid of the smell. Absolutely horrible, too strong and cuts through my sinus and head like a knife. No wonder it’s so cheap! Makes a lovely aftershave splash. Juicy, bright, refreshing, and clean. Cheers me up. Finish your shower then spray this stuff all over you. You will feel fantastic it might not smell like anything special but so what it has gone finished never to be heard from again after 20 minutes yet for that 20 minutes Life just seems to be more fun. 
Give it a go it only cost $5 a gallon. 200+ years in, and I don't care what anyone else says, it's the ultimate complex but easy, classy but approachable, good on everyone everytime scent. 
I once saw a literally gigantic bottle of this for sale (like over 1ft tall) and was like yep, that is not at all excessive, I totally get that. More of a feminine scent I'd say, and as a man, wouldn't wear this during the day as a main scent.
Reminds me of the KFC wet wipes. Used by generations of my family (the cologne, not KFC wipes, although probably them too) and was used throughout my childhood when I felt sick or suffered from anxiety/panic attacks.
Cool, refreshing, calming. A more masculine/youthful fragrance equivalent would be CK One. If you wear perfume or make an effort to smell nice only for yourself, you will love this.
Wait, you do have to love the scent of bitter orange too.
It is refreshing and almost cloying on application- but it will leave you high and dry with barely a skin scent in all of 1 hour.
While it lasts, it is very,very good.
I'm glad I got to finally try this. It is very unique. I can't imagine anyone under 40 years old wanting to wear this. Then again, I'm a few years under 40, but an old soul.
Tom Ford? One day when I think nothing of money. Those coming here expecting sillage and longevity have made their journey under the wrong pretenses. This EdC isn't for anyone other than you. If you've never put on a fragrance just for yourself, but only so that others can notice you, this might be the moment where you either have a paradigm shift and embrace what 4711 is, or you turn around and dismiss it as ""underperforming junk"". 
Many here rightly say this is a great warm weather after shower splash. I on the other hand tend to use it right when I get out of bed: while I'm making coffee/breakfast, starting my work day, everything before my daily workout preceding my shower. It transitions the body from its dormant phase overnight into where you need to be to get things going for the day ahead with a bright hit of well blended citruses. There's approximately 1 billion notes listed here on Fragrantica for 4711 but the top notes are where the game is played because this doesn't last long enough to fancy the heart or base much. 
And it not lasting is not a problem because 1) 4711 comes in huge god damn bottles and 2) those bottles are ridiculously inexpensive.
Don't be afraid to pour a couple rounds into your hands and put on your neck, wrists, wherever. It's inexpensive for a reason, because it's meant to be a transition scent. If this were the cost of Dior Homme Cologne (in and of itself a price point international travesty) you'd be well within your rights to not go anywhere near it. But it isn't, and you should. 
4711 is a fresh start, or restart, to the day whenever you need to snap out of a fog. It does this job admirably, and because its duties are very intimate and personal, I would recommend getting the splash bottles over the small spray bottle. Make your experience with 4711 tactile, let it run over your hands and apply its refreshment personally wherever you want with them. 
Treat 4711 as a daily ritual, much like the winding of a handwound movement in a watch. You'll be the better for it. Wore this on a hot sunny day and I kept the little watch bottle in my bag to freshen up with every now and then. A perfect cooling, citrus, herbal refresher that I can see being a summertime after-shower staple.
If you have to wear a facemask and have one made of fabric, splash a little bit of 4711 on the inside. It evaporates pretty quickly so it's not a day-long disaster if you put on too much by accident (which I've done with other perfume before, ackk!). Made my masked train journeys much more pleasant today, and was a bit of extra toning for the pores on my nose. Give it a try! After reading all the reviews here, i ordered it online as a blind buy thinking it will be similar to Neroli Portofino by Tom Ford. So here are my initial thoughts
Its Good, refreshing, light summer scent but does not give a premium vibe like TOM FORD NEROLI PORTOFINO. Its more like Ferrari Bright Neroli
Its very affordable low cost cologne but what i dont like about this Fragrance is its Silage and longevity. Its a close to skin scent with only a longevity of maximum 25 Min as it vanishes from your skin or clothes after that. 
Based on this down point, I would rate it 5.5/10 Refreshing, bright, and summery. I like this post-shower especially after a workout in the warmer months. No longevity beyond the first half hour. I have taken to layering it with Escentric Molecule 01 (use your ISO E Super of choice) which extends the longevity a little. Already have an extra big bottle. At least it's cheap and well made. A true classic cologne. My favourite after shower cologne during the summer months. It’s incredibly fleeting but so refreshing! It’s also very inexpensive, so treat yourself this summer, spray away and enjoy it!
Highly recommended! This is absolutely gorgeous but so ephemeral and fleeting I don’t know if I would repurchase. I ended up using this as a linen spray (I have the 3oz spray version). It’s quite similar to Florida water. The white florals are bright and fresh but there is a very alcoholic blast at first. I like it for what it Is, but am also longing for it to do more. If you want a longer lasting bright white floral, I recommend Fragonard Fleur d’Oranger. 4711 is a weird one and I like originals. I can see why some think it reminds them of bag spray cause that contain citronella compounds as well. 
To me it gives a good feeling, there are other smell that should be bad odour but I love: Bacuri butter, tea tree. Maybe it's heartiness or their good properties. An articule in fragrantica suggested that maybe we'll get a bleach-kind of scent next, because its association with cleanliness and we used it more lately, that we end up liking it!
To be a cheap cologne, it lasts and a beautiful bottle to add to its appeal This used to be my grandmother's signature scent. She passed away before I was born but it's nice that I can have this and feel connected to her :)
On me it's a very fresh oakmoss. Citruses never project off of my skin so it's mostly oakmoss, basil, vetiver and the jasmine makes it more unisex. It doesn't really go either masculine or feminine to me, it's just clean and fresh. When I smell it I get the image of someone in an old fashioned bathroom applying this after a long steamy bath! Lovely. I've been wearing this the past couple of days, trying to get my head around how I feel about it. It certainly has a lot of fans. Expectation can be a dangerous thing and following a lot of reviews I was expecting something fresh and at least a little citrusy. Unfortunately all I'm getting is a typical aftershave woodsy aromatic sent. As so many people mentioned neroli I looked this up and yes, that could be what I'm getting. It's meant to be a fresh spicy fragrance but I'd say it's more warm spicy. Barbershop scent? Yes. Longetivity and sillage are poor but that is balanced out by the very affordable price. All in all, despite everything, I really quite like it. This is what the Rhineland smells like in my memory... My partner was spending their mornings and afternoons going over videos for a biennial with a bunch of other curators and I was trying to lift a post-graduate school depression by hiking up the drachenfels, poking through churches and kunsthalles and drinking way too much beer... This scent, all bright citrus kick and alcoholic spice backlit that beautiful trip - a little ass-kicker of a fragrance, cheeky and invigorating but still utterly classic! I'd douse myself in the stuff before heading out for the day, keeping a package of the tissues in my purse for a mid-train ""refresh"" between cities and towns.... Aachen, Bonn, Düsseldorf, Oberdollendorf... or a hike into the mountains to track down that winery or this beer hall that was only reachable on foot... In July of 2018 we had one of the worst heat waves to hit that year. Our AC blew out late in the evening and temperatures were still over the 100s. While my significant other ran on an emergency trip to home depot to replace it, I stayed behind trying to stay cool. In the middle of trying to meditate myself into a popsicle four numbers came to my mind, 4711. That night I put my bottle in the freezer and every five minutes I would spritz myself. I keep a bottle in my fridge ever since.
This is definitely the most refreshing scent in my collection. This reminds me of a cold glass of lemon water. It is zesty and watery, it’s not sharp or sweet making it soothing. Longevity is pretty nonexistent making it easy to use throughout the day to freshen up. There is a beauty to it when it’s been on the skin for few minutes.
A decant of this goes with me everywhere. Napoleon used to love 4711. He would order it in huge amounts, and every morning he would consume a sugar cube dipped in the juice. He believed this practice had an invigorating effect and kept him energized through the day. 
4711 is indeed so good, it is I think the only thing I would buy a 800 ml bottle of. I love this. It's deceptively simple but actually complex. 
I was given a couple of bottles by my grandmother when I was about 10. One was the round traditional older bottle and one the newer flask version. I remember her telling me that she wore it when she had a headache. I guess it was a detox from her Blue Grass. I still have those bottles. 
I think of Eau de Cologne as the gin of scent, something you use when you need to perk yourself up. Such a super refreshing unisex scent, super cheap too. My timeless classic for years for the summer when the heat and heat are overwhelming. Vaporizing immediately gives that great feeling of freshness, that intense citrus scent make me love it forever. Perfect mix !!!! The original cologne. Very weak but very cheap, so don't be afraid to overindulge. Cologne lovers are to relish in it. I'm sorry to read so many negative reviews on this one. Yes, of course the formulation has changed a little over the last 200+ years, but what hasn't? I think one needs to understand the history of cologne to really appreciate that this is one of the originals, not a perfume, and certtainly not ""newbie garbage""!
The formulation itself was medicinal, herbs and citrus, and follows closely its medieval predecessors. Though its own not-unromantic origins are in the French-occupied German city of Cologne in the late-eighteenth century, it was perhaps the first widely-circulated name-brand of its kind. The popularity of the formulation is attested in that so many contemporaries boasted similar ingredients. One example is Geurlain's Eau Impériale, fabled to have been mixed for Empress Eugénie to treat her migraine.
No longer meant for ingestion, 4711 is fresh and alcoholic, dissipating quickly after giving its effect, similar to that of modern aftershaves. It can be used to cool perspiring skin, say, after a workout, as a bracer after a shave - both men and women - , as a spray to refresh a room, linen, clothing, etc., or as a very effective astringent. Despite its respectiful history, today 4711 original smells like the products used to clean the floor or the windows. I tried it several times, but unfortunatelly this impression repeated every time. Overall, ignoring that association that might not correspond to the majority of users, 4711 original presents a sour smell, citric, fresh and watery, that wouldn't be appropriated for winter or colder nights. Moreover, it is linear along the time, for those that liked it from the beggining, won't have any bad surprise later. First off, how the hell is neroli not in the fragrance pyramid?? It's the dominant note! And what a glorious note it is. Secondly, for an EDC, I'm getting surprising longevity as a skin scent compared to some other 4711 offerings.
There is a reason this has been around for centuries. It's a straight up masterpiece! Sure, it would be cool to have it in a stronger formula, but maybe that's kind of the allure--its fleeting nature makes it that much more precious. 
So, spray lavishly. Mr. Muelhens has given us a timeless gift! I picked up an 800 ml bottle on sale, mixed it with a 12 oz bottle of plain aloe vera gel in a big pump bottle for the best hand sanitizer ever! I use this on a hot day at work to refresh...works amazing...i put some in a travel spray...also a great sanitizer...got 200ml for $20...i use turkish tabac (tobacco) in fall/winter I have this on order. I am aware of its poor longevity. I am mainly going to wear this on clothing. Does it last good in shirts/T-shirt's etc. I am not expecting the world from £16 300ml fragrance. This cologne has been the favourite of men in my family for generations. It's light, clean, fresh and it hits a little nostalgic for me as well. Despite all of the fragrances that have come and gone from my collection this one has been in the rotation since I've been in high school. Growing up in Austria and Germany in the 1980s, I remember these bottles of 4711 Kölnisch Wasser (that's German for Eau de Cologne - or rather, Eau de Cologne is French for Kölnisch Wasser, he he) being EVERYWHERE. 
Whenever you stepped into someone's - anyone's - bathroom, there would be one of these. The miniatures were popular gifts for children, especially from elderly relatives, and I had quite a few of them. 
Back then I thought the 4711 Original Eau de Cologne to be slightly sour and bitter. It is not strong, so I did not much mind it, but I was not a fan. 
This has certainly changed! I am super-impressed by this light-weight now. I get a delicious blend of citrus fruit, a tinge of flowers (the roses, I think), and a bit of backbone - probably the vetiver. It is extremely refreshing and well-blended. 
Poor longevity and sillage, but then it is not an Eau de Parfum, but a Kölnisch Wasser ;-) This is great for a cologne. It's too weak to be used as a fragrance. The smell reminds me of old times... the 1920's, people wearing suits as everyday attire. Even though it's not mentioned in the notes, I get strong Neroli throughout. I bought a massive bottle of this to use as hand sanitizer during pandemic. totally amazing for this purpose...plus leaves lovely scent that is gone in 30 min.
lightly sweet citrus scent. love it. At 85% alcohol content, I've been splashing this on my hands after washing them. I'm not qualified to make medical claims, but it's probably an extra step against germs and viruses, and more importantly, it's a soothing olfactory cap to what has become the slightly stressful process of sanitizing oneself after coming home. 4711 is the original Tom Ford Neroli Portofino - a close relative of most modern fresh, aromatic-citrusy fragrances. It's a gorgeous, uplifting classic. The potential disinfecting properties of the eau de cologne are really just a bonus. Its a fantastic hand sanitiser. I bought 800 ml bottle - so happy! This is an aftershave, not something to place high expectations on for longevity. After a shave, splash it on, enjoy the shot of freshness and have your TRUE scent ready to go for the remainder of the day. Again, use as an aftershave and top it with a fresh summer or spring oriented cologne. This will not have a huge impact on what you choose to wear, but I would avoid mixing it with something expensive or not in line with a citrus fresh orientation. This is a good inexpensive mood lift, but I do agree our body chemistry can influence a direction a fragrance will take, as this lacks projection it could easily swing badly for some. Enjoy the inexpensive price, use as intended, appreciate the old world charm it represents. One of the things I love about perfume is that inexpensive purchases can be just as cheering (if not more so) than expensive ones. While I love many high end fragrances, a perfume need not be expensive to be high quality and beautiful. 4711 Original Eau de Cologne is often recommended not only as a must try classic cologne, but is also one of the very best inexpensive fragrances. 
I prefer to spray rather than splash so I ordered a 90 ml bottle and was delighted to discover that it is refillable. This is a classic citrus cologne, indeed it is literally the original eau de cologne, at this time just shy of being in production for 230 years. There is a medley of citrus fruits in the top notes, followed by fresh (but not overly feminine) flowers, on a base of woods and mosses with touch of musk. I agree with other reviewers that there is pleasant medicinal quality to it. Using it gives me the same healthful feeling as washing my hands when they are visibly dirty. 
This has almost no sillage and lasts less than an hour but I'm more than okay with that, I love it. You wear this for yourself, and not for others. I'll be carrying this with me into spring and certainly all summer, spraying with abandon to refresh myself in a hot, humid city. Throw a bottle of this into your handbag and cheerfully get on with your life. Some of the criticism of 4711 has me laughing. Sure, the longevity and projection is very weak and grannies may like it. This isn't a cologne for others to smell on you; it's a splasher, a cool boost for the face whether it be on a hot day or after shaving. It has that slightly medicinal vibe that is just so fresh and feels like it's doing you good. Lush! If you want it to last longer, decant some into an atomiser and spray. It settles down a little more slowly and remains as a skin scent for a couple of hours. This is lovely. I have so many good memories of this. We always had this in the house when I was growing up (I'm 20 btw) and I recently gifted another bottle to my mum for Christmas. It sort of surprises me how many notes are listed because to me this is not an overly complicated scent. It's very citrusy but I don't find it sour or sharp it has some sort of a green quality to it which I think is most prominently basil (without any bitterness). Such a lovely refreshing summer scent that mellows out into a fresh woodsy yet still citrusy fragrance. I wish it lasted longer as it disappears rather quickly. It's not a complete sin as the price tag is rather reasonable. 
Reminds me of trips to the zoo in the heat (minus the animal smells) when I was little or playing at the playground in the heat of the Budapest summer. No bathroom should be without this. The one that started off the name ""cologne"" 228 years old but still classy and relevant. It is so cheap, it's a no brainer, a 300ml bottle can be purchased for £15. I actually get better longevity and projection by attaching a 10ml atomiser to the head and spraying it over myself (8-10 sprays). I've had this fragrance since I was 9 or 10 (halcyon days), always remembering that refreshing lemon/citrus opening evolving to an evocative green that I am sure is neroli. The note pyramid doesn't ring a bell with me. It's versatile, refreshing, impresses my daughter when used as a flame thrower. I will always carry this with me. It is citrusy and sharp at first but a short time later there's a creamy sweetness that develops. It's one of the best fresh, green scents I've tried. It's a skin scent, not much projection and it really is gone in a couple hours, but it's so inexpensive you just apply it liberally as often as you want. Buy the 800ml bottle and go beast-mode on it! It's about the cost of a 100ml bottle of most other fragrances. Perfect summer fragrance. Just citruses, nothing more. Neither much longevity, neither else...neither pleasure at least. But no problem, in very short time it's gone :)) Year 1792, nice to meet you! It is such a pleasure to experience history in this manner. Refreshing, is it not?
I love the fact that it is still commercially active and available at almost every decent perfume store.
Vintage looking bottle adds some interior design points to the bathroom and I love spraying it all around me after work to lift off the stresses of the day and get ready and recharged for the evening.
The new TF Metallique reminds me of it somehow.. It smells pretty good, but a problem is nobody is going to smell it. It evaporates within minutes. The best reason for buying this would be if it's fun for you to spray a lot, which is understandable. I was interested in 4711 as it was often referred to as a dupe for TF neroli portofino. I blind bought because of all the positive reviews and its cheap price. Now I know I am a fan of neither. Scent wasn't too pleasant for me. Reminds me of some medicines and it was too old fashioned for my liking. I especially dislike the powdery scent that's left once all the citrus scent evaporates in its first 5 minutes. The longevity is on a whole new level. Few sprays will last less than 30 minutes (at most). Just to experiment I washed my hands with it and it didn't last any longer. It only left ickiness on my hands like after using a hand-sanitiszer. Regret buying HUGE bottle even with its cheap price. I guess it will be sitting in my display cupboard for a decorative purpose. Think.......what other fragrances can be had in 800 mls? The bottle shape and labelling together make this worth buying. This is one for the moment of application not for longevity. As the packaging states, use generously, breathe in, breathe out and relax. That said, it has been around since 1792 so must have found sustained favour over those passing years. On me it lasts a little less well than another classic EDC; Acqua di Selva by Visconti di Modrone. If you want the freshness to repeat then fill a pocket atomiser and use regularly throughout the day. One final comment on longevity: there are many EDT's and EDP's out there nowadays which also disappear almost before the bottle is re-corked. The difference with 4711 is that it has and will continue to endure because it smells so damn good! Anyone serious about fragrance should keep a bottle, as a reference, as a detox diet even. You go back to it and reset your nose and any other senses, when needed. Really a honest thing from another time… bergamot… lemon… lily… jasmine… cedar... go for a big bottle as this is to be splashed allover. It’s not about lasting, it is about resetting. Happiness of the moment, always gone and just enjoyed in the present without much thought and certainly no judgement. Something so simple, when time is right, is a luxury. Less a review (sorry) and more of an enquiry.
I've not smelled 4711 for a very long time. I remember seeing it on my nana's bedroom dressing table many many years back. 
I understand that 4711 is an EDC and that it is, and is supposed to be, fresh and refreshing. And as an EDC is not expected to have longevity.
What I'm curious about (and I'm no expert here) is the fact that it has oakmoss, patch, cedar, vetiver etc listed in the base notes, so I'm wondering why it doesn't have better longevity than it does? After reading some of the reviews, I was quite surprised to see those notes listed at all. I haven't read any reviews referencing any notes particularly other than the citrus. Shocking how short a time this splash lasts no more than 20 minutes.... And it's gone in my opinion buying this is a complete waste of money.... That's how I feel after buying a dam 300ml bottle.... 4711 has been used in my family at least 4 generations deep but not for anything NORMAL like spritzing it on when you’re heading out but instead whenever you get cut on the knee or a scrape on the arm etc LOL! And now that I’m a grown woman I still do the same thing my parents did! You guys remember that scene from “My Big Fat Greek Wedding” and their “thing” for windex being the cure all? Well for my family it’s this thing.. Lol. So my wounds always smell of 4711.. I suppose they did for the alcohol content and even though I fully realize how ridiculous this is, it’s comforting to do! Any way I always need this darn thing around for that reason and probably always will lol. I hope a few of you out there had your grandmothers spritz this on your scraped knees too! The perfect summer splash on the face after a shave on a hot/humid summer morning. Ideal cologne to take on a summer vacation before trotting to the beach with the wife and kids. Works superb as an aftershave after a wet facial shave. My kids and wife love this summery fragrance.
The only issue is the longevity is not good. But that should be expected for a splash cologne. Although the scent only lasts 30 minutes. I guarantee you it's a glorious 30 minutes and you'll enjoy every whiff... as will those around you. If you dislike the scent of this beauty. Then you probably dislike summer. Too bad for you. It's absolutely a summer legend. Dear fragranticans, ""eau de cologne"" was meant for freshness, an invigorating splash, and it doesn't last. Citruses usually do not last too. They are not playing in the orientals yard ... And you can't compare this to TF's Portofino, please, check the price tag. 4711 is the good oldie everybody remembers having seen in the family bathroom. Nothing hype or posh, just an heavy bottle of freshness for spring and mostly summer. On opening I'm reminded of peach schnapps (in a good way), as it settles down the orange oil really comes forward with some basil thrown in there. For a cheap buy it's a great fragrance. This is a novelty fragrance. One buys it for the experience and it’s nostalgia.
The opening is certainly citrusy fantastic. It can be enjoyed for about an hour. Then...it’s gone. 
If you had a way to carry this around with you, you can be that guy spraying down in pubic, but you would have to apply it every other hour.
For the price, have at it. It can be used as an aftershave afterward. My go to frag when I´m jogging or at the gym. Fresh, sporty and somewhat restrained animalic. I've been trying all kinds of neroli citrus perfumes that share a similar vein with 4711, including Tom Ford Neroli Portofino, Mugler Cologne, Acqua di Parma Colonia Essenza, and a few others...
I have to say in my humble opinion no contender can beat 4711, not within my limited knowledge of scents, that is (if one do not consider the longevity). Now I see why they offer 800ml bottles...! Of course! It's so frustrating that it has zero lasting power! Neroli Portofino lacks the finesse of 4711, sadly... Lovely citrus scent smells very similar to Tom Ford neroli portofino. Yes this does not last at all but that's reflected in the price. In Germany I believe this is not traditionally used as a perfume but to feel fresh. They sell this in wipes, soap, shower gel and deodorant. If you're looking for a citrusy soap then definitely worth buying some of it in soap format I have had compliments on my soap. I have an 800ml bottle which I decant into a little atomiser. In my line of work I am in an enclosed space where sometimes we may get people that have a terrible lingering odor I spray this then as a kind of air freshener to mask the odor. You may ask why not just use air freshener? Well this smells better than any air freshener you can buy, it's inoffensive and it will linger around long enough for the bad odor to pass. I was introduced to 4711 by an acquaintance back in the early 1980's and have loved it like a flighty friend ever since. I recently watched (with a smile of affection) Billy Joel liberally douse his bald head with it halfway through a sweaty summer concert. While my tastes have grown over the years, I still think this is such a fun one to have and hold. And yes, I do think the Tom Ford NP is very similar. I don't hold high expectations for longevity with something this airy and light. A must-have classic. Not because I love it, but because it's THE COLOGNE. Something worn in the 18th century and probably still will be worn long after we here are all dead.
(It does not last long and starts extremely citrusy, then a flowery smell emerges which reminds me of bathroom creams, so it's rather feminine for me - but who cares, that's not the point.) Very citrusy at the start. Like the bitter rind of a lemon. A bit green from the vetiver and the patchouli but not like cut grass, more like you're drinking lemonade while sitting in a garden. Sharp but sweet, like the leaves of a lemon tree. The flowers give it some depth and nuance. Still amazing after all those years. Doesn't last long but that's the point of a cologne. And it's super cheap so definitely worth a buy. So I was excited to leave my review on this scent and be able to share what this smells like. It wasn’t until I got here that I realized that 65 of you feel the same way. Of course I’m talking about Ferrari Bright Neroli. Here’s the thing, I hate Ferrari Bright Neroli. To my nose it’s has a citrus moth ball type of thing going on that just repulses me. However, that being said I love 4711, so they are not the exact same, but FBN goes in a different direction that just disturbs my nose, where as 4711 is a better refined version, but a hell of a lot weaker. To those wondering how to make this stuff last longer, it’s not for the skin, it’s for the clothes, at least that’s my trick. If you want to take a risk Ferrari Bright Neroli lasts a hell of a lot longer than 4711, but to me just doesn’t smell as good. I wish there was a product that could increase weak scents. I have molecule 1 and even tried that, but in my experience the whole layering scents with Molecule 01 is a myth. Besides on my skin Molecule 01 is too woody, I have a version where it’s turned up to almost an EDP. Anyway, if you’re looking for a way to extend, be generous on you shirt while spraying and you should get a 6-8 hour scent that lasts for a work day. Cheers fellas... Very very clean. A safe blind buy IF you are not looking not looking for longevity or sillage. Very inexpensive for a 25 ounce bottle. 
A hot weather essential.i buy the largest bottle and decant into 1 or 2 ounce glass sprays for portability. And for keeping in the refrigerator. As others have noted this is not, on its own, a traditional “perfume”. Sometimes you want a lift for yourself ,without sharing it wth the world. 
I will add a few drops of peppermint oil or neroli oil to the smaller sprays. This is very zingy! 
This is a multipurpose fragrance; after shave, after shower splash, dab on temples for headaches and lightly scenting the interior of handbags. 
This lasts longer when applied to moisturized skin. Great just after a shower or as a refresher when it's hot. Really lovely floral and citrus scent, but lasts about 10 minutes, so you can't really class this as a fragrance. Still worth getting a bottle though, the scent itself is divine. 5/10 Very Nice as a after shave or a refresher after a shower, but is infamously known for poor performance. I get soft projection and 30 minutes maximum longevity. 
Excellent aftershave, not a cologne in my opinion. This reminds me of my teen years. I fell inlove with the scent right away. This is the adult cologne version of nenuco. I love the lemony fresh scent it gives, very refreshing esp when I spray this during summer. When I feel dizzy, 4711 easily calms me down. Its not sickening. Im glad that i can buy the bigger bottle of this cologne. تازه و پرطراوت

Overall: 7.2/10 Having owned Neroli Portofino I can agree this definitely has the same vibe just without the backbone & and quality of the private blend. However this is a great and extremely cheap cologne that I really enjoy using as a traditional aftershave after a good shave. Splashing some on after a shower during the summer would also be perfect for that extra bit of refreshment. What I love most is that because it doesn’t last long by the time you are ready to leave the house if you decide to wear another fragrance this will most likely not clash with anything as it’s closer to wearing off by then. I plan on replacing my bottle as soon as my current empties. Smells like ice and lime rind. Maybe of the taste of black Halls candies. A cold stark scent, however not offensive at all. Curious smelling very crisp and lively like a burst of frosted winter air doused in sunshine. I for one like this but will admit it doesn’t last but 1-2 hrs max on my skin. It performs longer than 5 minutes! Now I don’t know if it’s just me but it seems as your body temperature rises it activates it, at least on my skin. Because of this it’s good for working out and spraying like a body spray when getting out of the shower, laying around the house, or before going to bed. It’s unique for sure. Don’t know how true it is but I heard it was John F. Kennedy’s favorite cologne. As strange as it may sound, this is my favorite cologne in the world. I love it on myself, my (ex-)boyfriends, on everyone, everywhere. Such a delight all the way, from the (extremely) citrusy start to the amazing woody dry drown. Everybody seems to think that it lasts five minutes and has no dry down, but this is absolutely untrue. It dries down beautifully. My grandmother had only one perfume, and it was this one. No luck for me, my own mom hates it! ;-) To each his own, I guess. I was recommended this as an alternative to tom ford. 300ml for £14 seemed a bargain so bought some. Weird as mom used to have this when i was a child and i hated it..thinking it was old fashioned. A hot summer had my children and myself splashing it on and everyone loved the fresh zesty feeling it gives you. No its not a perfume..what it gives you is a blast of refreshment on a hot summers day and its now a family must have x I grew up with 4711, and frankly it's hard to think of it as a fragrance. It's more of a staple than a perfume in many German households, used to refresh and clean one's hands and neck in hot and sweaty situations. I've a particular fondness for the icy roller ball and sponge tip applicators and scented tissues, they were delicious to use. Instant heat relief! Also great to cool down mosquito bites!
The scent of 4711 is iconic, fresh and sharp, nearly pure alcohol and a tiny bit of fragrance. I love it! 
There are a number of flankers available, none of which I'm familiar with. It would be interesting to try out some of them, but I'm on a budget. :(
It's worth to make a blind buy for the original 4711 and keep it around for the summer heat. Keep cool with Koelnisch Wasser! Unlike most here, this doesn't bring back memories of the days of yore - my relatives were never really into fragrances, and being on the opposite side of the world from Germany, we never really had 4711's products sold here.
However, I managed to get my hands on a bottle this week. I was expecting a spray bottle, so imagine my surprise when I realised it was a splash! I've never used one of these before, so it was new to me.
The surprise, nevertheless, was actually the smell. I didn't really pick up any citrus or neroli notes on the first whiff, actually; the moment I smelled it, I instantly recognised it as the scent of the antibacterial soaps and hand cleansers used in public hospitals here! I must say, I'm pretty surprised that I had been using 4711 every time I visited warded relatives!
It took a few more tries to slowly differentiate the different notes - what hit me immediately was distinct notes of bergamot and petitgrain, which I noticed smelled drier upon application to the skin than when in the bottle. The drydown is a clean, sweet, pleasant floral scent reminiscent of neroli, which doesn't stay for long - about an hour - but at its price, I'd say this cologne is absolutely worth it! It's also good as a refresher to perk me up during dreary work-days, as many have mentioned here, and its short life helps it to fit this role perfectly. This takes me straight back to my childhood and travelling on planes in the 70s. It was the must have, and really made you feel clean and fresh on or after a flight. It is not long lasting but gives you a clean solid 'hit' of awake & clean, perfect for any time you need a quick pick me up! And the fact it doesn't linger can be a bonus. No scale on Fragrantica to put on this one. Longevity is 5 minutes and absolutely no projection, oh well maybe like 5 mins as well. Good cologne you can use right after the evening shower to refresh and at the same time calm yourself. Using as a day scent is completly pointless, because it just doesn't smell at all. I got 90 ml bottle for like $5 or less, just to check it's vintage roots. It's more for collecting purposes than for everyday use. I believe that these 42 people who chceked enormous sillage and 17 ones who put ""very long lasting"" are spraying 4711 every 4 and a half minute, haha! This cologne is a dive into the past. Many say it's the first one: WRONG !. The first real cologne is 1709 Eau de cologne by Farina (Giovanni Maria Farina was the first creator of cologne). Nothing to remove from 4711 but we give to Caesar what is Caesar's. This is a really lovely pick me up. My mum used to have it on occasion, and now I do too. I think a lot of people mistake it for a fragrance that is going to stay on their skin for hours, but more so it's supposed to be medicinal - to have medicinal properties for the mind and spirit. On the box it tells you to splash some on palms, rub together, breathe in, breathe out, and relax. And it is relaxing, as well as invigorating. It's a beautiful, calming, citrusy, herb garden in summer. It's fresh and re-energizing. If you're feeling tired or stressed in any way it really does help. It's like opening a window to your inner being to let some fresh air and sunshine in. Just lovely.
Edit: I also find layering it with Green Tea by Elizabeth Arden works nicely. The scents hold enough similarity to compliment, mix, and sit well with one another. I do love this and associate it with my grandfather and dad. But it's great for a woman too. It's the most refreshing scent, it's wonderful, you feel like you are clean and have spent time swimming in a lake on a sunny day. It doesn't last long at all, so it's really just a brief and refreshing treat. Worth it tho!
I don't have a ""nose,"" but even I can tell this is citrusy and bergomatty. It's as refreshing as Jean Nate, but maybe a bit more sophisticated. It has been around for hundreds of years, too. Very nice cologne. It's amazing how it smells like Neroli Portofino although there is no neroli in here! It's a bit strong for me though. This is one of the top one hundred perfumes on fragrantica for good reason. The ORIGINAL! There is a lot of history about this cologne. It was originally called a ""miracle water"". When the French occupied Germany, Napoleon demanded to know the ingredients, but Wilhelm Muehlens refused. I go into the details here. I cannot rate this fragrance fairly because we all know 4711 is more of an aftershave/EDC more than anything else.

⭐⭐⭐⭐ Neroli Portofino is a copycat of this affordable cologne. I strayed from purchasing TF based off the fact that it simply didn't last long enough for the price. 
4711 is very refreshing! I had no idea I'd love lemon in perfume but I do! As others have mentioned, the issue with this cologne is longevity. Oh how I wish this lasted longer... I'm glad I bought it though because the 30 minutes it lasts are pleasure. I have worn this since being a child. I find now that the body spray lasts longer than the Cologne. Such a fresh scent. calming fragrance and since it does not last I give it a spritz or two on my pillow to help me fall asleep I just visited Cologne and wandered into the Tourist office, just outside the Cathedral. A display of this cologne was featured, and I remembered reading about it a while back on Fragrantica.com. What better place to try it and purchase it than Cologne! 
It's actually a fantastic summer cologne for men. Not too feminine to my nose but light and very citrusy and bright. 
I've been using it like an aftershave (and it lasts about that long). 
Given that the formula was created 226 years ago, it has amazing staying power (though very poor sillage). Super interesting to read all the reviews here treating this as a full fledged fragrance.
Yeah, it is, true enough, yet in Germany hardly anyone really treats it that way... at least judging from people I know.
I got introduced to this as a child by my late aunt Mary, who used it all her life mainly to freshen up during long train journeys, which is why we always had a bunch of travel size bottles to toss in our purses.
If you were stuck with insufferably sweaty people in a stuffy train compartment you'd dash some on your handkerchief and sniff that. If you really had a long journey without a real chance to wash you'd at least retreat to the wash room briefly, splash it on your neck and wipe some around your arms.
(Mostly older) people who really like it might use it after shaving or their morning wash up too for that extra boost. But I don't think anyone would really expect it to last throughout the day. It's just supposed to give you a feeling of freshness.
As a German I grew up with it and really rather know it as a universal affordable on the go way to freshen up or brave smelly situations during travels. And that purpose it serves very well since generations.
I'd never be able to discuss notes in this though. It's an established Eau de Cologne since generations and when I smell it I just know it's 4711 unmistakably. It's fresh, initially quite sharp, but turning to just a 'clean' smell quickly.
Classic blend, glad that still many people seem to be enjoying it. 4711 EDC is the perfect pick me up during Summer or those especially hot days. It's fresh and sweet (just a little) a bit like a citric candy. Probably a bit better for me in a spray bottle than a splash, but I'll take any form of this I can get. 
Not to be worn as a fragrance, per se, but more to be used during the moments too hot to wear fragrance. Quite possibly one of the best smelling concoctions ever invented. 
Many others below, have described the fascinating history behind it, as well as in depth analysis of the fragrance and much better than I can ever do, so I will stick to a few basic facts.
Strong Neroli and citric notes. The basil is there, but never dominant. Aside from these three, the other notes will demand serious concentration to discern and are as I see it, complimentary notes which are there to balance out the composition.
I use the shower gel daily, but as a fragrance its useless unless you fancy respraying yourself every hour. 
Go for Ferrari Bright Neroli instead. Essentially the same smell that has slightly enhanced citrus, comes with better longevity and is equally cheap. A wearable and enjoyable piece of history that’s incredibly affordable - how often can you say that? Love this summery and fresh scent. Not long lasting, just a lovely refresher when you need a pick me up. This is the same formula as the first eau de cologne ever produced, back in 1792 in the city of Cologne, Germany. It is one of the oldest perfumes still in production continously. It is theorized that the emporer Napolean Bonaparte would use an entire bottle of this every day. All modern colognes are based on this blend, particularly so with Tom Ford's Neroli Portofino which is basically a copy of this with added strength. The opening is very soapy and smells a lot like neroli (orange blossom), but I also detect strong notes of lemon and lime. The notes smell very natural as well, and not synthetic at all. On drydown it smells mainly of soapy neroli; it is extremely pleasant. The fragrance does not lean masculine or feminine - and I actually bought a bottle of this for my mom as well. The sillage is weak leaning moderate while the longevity is also very weak (lasts about 1-2 hours max), however - but this was the case with traditional eau de colognes which were meant to freshen up and not as long-lasting perfumes. I bought a large 200 ml splash bottle of this and simply decant it in a travel atomizer that I carry with me, which I spray before I'm meeting people at times. For this purpose, it works very well indeed. Overall I absolutely love the scent of this although the sillage and longevity are fleeting - though there have been alternatives made in this neroli-citrus style like Mugler Cologne, Ferrari's Bright Neroli, Bond No. 9 Eau de New York, Acqua di Parma Colonia Essenza, and Tom Ford Neroli Portofino Forte. Being a neroli fanatic, I own most of these already but still appreciate 4711 EDC. It is one of two 'historical' colognes I have, the other being Pinaud's virgin island bay rum.
5/5 I first experienced 4711 before Kindergarten - a German neighbor family had lots of 4711 goodies and I loved it. I've worn it off and on ever since, and really miss it when I run out. Citrusy, refreshing, uplifting, happy-making, and it keeps me sane during Detroit's hot n humid summers. I even carry it in my purse in a little spray bottle for hot weather and flashes. ;) The massive 27oz/798ml bottles are wonderful and last forever.
My BF gave me my current gigantic bottle - he chose it because he loves wearing it, too!
My BF took me to see a wonderful German musician perform, and I almost wore my 4711. Imagine my delight when I caught a gentle whiff of *his* 4711 when we shook hands! :D I wish I'd worn it after all. XD I say I don't wear 4711 Original but inhale. The poor poor performance here makes me have the idea it's truly true to its original 1792(!) formulation.
On the box it writes: EST. 1792, 86 VOL. ...More than just a fragrance! The unique composition of 4711 Original eau de cologne has a positive effect on body, mind and soul and has been appreciated across the globe since 1792. To experience the superior quality for yourself: splash 4711 generously onto the hands, rub together, BREATHE IN, BREATHE OUT and relax.
I have to spray it once every 3 minutes and repeat it 3 times on the same spot to find the scent exist, but for 10 minutes. (The truth is it's still there but difficult to recognise.) It's like an air-pleasing than cologne. Maybe after-shower usage, best for office purpose, it won't offend anyone anything including the perfume you actually wear, just spray as much as you are please. It's cheap, classic and refreshing. I even use it as a dry hand wash (after the breathe in breathe out pratice;)
Strongly recommand to buy a spray one first than splash. The bottle is refillable.
Batch: 2377 Made in Germany Well, I've found yet another splash to shamelessly horde and keep in every one of my bags. I don't have much to add to the choir singing 4711 praises, so forgive me for reiterating what's already been said.
Neroli Portofino's perky, herbal zest and neroli were blatantly cloned from 4711, the reviews aren't kidding. I haven't worn NP but have tested it countless times at the mall, always disheartened by its crazy price tag. So imagine how I felt when I learned a cheap as chips, 200-year-old eau de cologne supposedly smelled just like it. I went ahead and sprang for a small bottle without a second thought.
I wasn't disappointed. This is an anti-depressant/aspirin in olfactory form. 4711 is honestly the most beautiful citrus I've ever smelled, and citrus tends not to impress me. When I whiffed my bottle, I knew I had smelled this before. Its fingerprints are on every moist towlette, after shave, and citrus soap ever produced. It is, at once, soothing and energizing. Its age is a testimony to its timelessness--how have I not heard of 4711 before?
The lemon is prominent, but I believe it mainly acts as a supporting note to orange rind and herbaceous basil. When you smell 4711, you get a blast of photo-realistic citruses and green, bitter leaves. This is the majority of the fragrance. I get vague fruity florals in the background, but they're barely there. I mostly detect melon and watery lily. Reading the history of 4711, I learned that it was originally dubbed a 'miracle water' by a monk who produced it. While grandiose, it's an apt sentiment. 4711 smells like a child's concept of a cure-all, or holy water. 
Staying power is dismal, as others have said. I find myself constantly splashing my small bottle to try and keep the fragrance to no avail. It's gone within an hour, probably less. I can't fault it for this reason, though. It's available in a very affordable and huge bottle, which I plan on purchasing. Ahhh... if only my sweat smelled like this. The textbook cologne, possibly the great grandfather of all lemon based colognes. Originally created in 1792, it's the oldest running formulation I've tried. I've been familiar with 4711 since I was a child, my earliest sense memories are infused with the strong bergamot-citrus oil. It is not long lasting, rather it's meant to be used as a pick me up on a hot day or an after bath splash, tingly, refreshing and brief. Many people keep 4711 in their medicine cabinets to help relieve headaches, nausea, sunburn... you name it. I bought this cologne because it is cheap and one of my friends claimed that it smells like Acqua di Parma original cologne, ...
yes it does smell like Acqua di Parma... I cannot tell them apart... Same smell same non existent performance... I might as well copy and paste the same review...
Here is my verdict:
...one single layer of citrus mix...
...very summery...
...very clean...
...very innofensive...
...projects for around 15 to 20 minutes and in about one hour there is no trace of it left...
As a scent:
I cannot believe that people could possibly wear this as a ""serious"" perfume...
Scent: 4/10
Performance 0/10
Taking into account what it costs...
5/10 I got this cologne due to a fragrantica review that it smelled exactly like TF Neroli Portofino....and omg! There is no mistaking that this smells like it was the poster perfume or prototype for that fragrance and all the other perfumes/ colognes that smelled like this without the ridiculously high price?! I like the neroli and portofino scent by TF but I just don‘t see myself paying that ridiculously high price tag for a smell that is common. This is so much more worth it! Doesn‘t matter if it is just a cologne you can have a small atomizer and just refill it everytime with such affordable price you won‘t feel guilty! ❤️ this cologne and will certainly enjoy it during the summer months on the beach and vacation! Thank you Fragrantica community! @Louismanuel: Do you normally seek out fault in people who at least care enough to share their thoughts with the community? How utterly small of you.
Of course 4711 is a lot older than JVAB. But that wasn't the point. I don't always try fragrances in the order in which they were created, do you? So if you tried Varvatos first and then 4711, would 4711 not remind you of Varvatos? 
I have a humble suggestion for you. Rather than seeking out fault and disagreement, why not try taking yourself a little less seriously? Show some well deserved kindness and gratitude to all the folks who make this site a true community. I think it's a safe bet that Fragrantica has given more to you than vice-versa. Call me crazy, but something about this is very similar to John Varvatos Artisan Blu. Both share an almost ""Coppertone"" suntan lotion vibe, which to my nose is very pleasant and evocative of summer. And IMHO, both easily qualify as unisex, given their lightness and summery feel. At first sniff, I think the JV packs a bit more depth and citrus brightness. After a few minutes, 4711 really opens up into fresh orange zest, only to evolve back to its sunscreen-like vibe. Strange evolution, but not bad in any way while it lasts -- which is not long.
For the money, I think 4711 is a really nice pick-me-up type scent for those dog days of summer. Don't judge it for its sillage or longevity -- that's not what scents like this are about. It's all about the cooldown, and in that regard, I think this stuff shines. By definition it's nothing new or unique - and that is perfectly ok too. 
There is a reason why 4711 has been around as long as it has. It's cheap, nice and refreshing for male and female, young and young-at-heart alike. And according to popular lore, JFK used it - how's that for the ""interesting"" factor? Just buy it already! The best. The acme of perfection. I have been smelling and wearing this eau de cologne since 1947 and will probably be buried wearing it. If some horrible circumstance reduced me to having to choose only ONE scent to wear for the rest of my life, this would be it. It has a spiritually uplifting effect on me. I have been known to use it as a room spray if i feel down. Bonus points: it is modestly priced and has a beautiful label. This is such a refreshing scent! Citrusy and fresh. I can picture a barber happily slapping this onto freshly shaven cheeks! This is a scent that would be suitable for men or women, as it is pretty neutral.
I have found, unfortunately that this one is one of those scent mirages. You think its there,then POOF it's gone. At least on my skin. It lingers for a bit longer on fabric. If you're looking for staying power, this isn't the one.But it's delightful while its there! Cocolover56 summed up this fragrance very nicely! It just doesn't last long enough on my skin. Great for hot humid summer days and nights. I remember trying this about twenty years ago in a drugstore, when these were the types of fragrances I could afford. 
I probably I chose a knock off of CK1, since that was popular right then and I always thought the fakes of that one were good. Maybe because the ingredients are cheap. It was called Gender One, actually. 
But this scent left an impression because of its tres funky vintage, memorable bottle and its unique freshness.
God I LOVE the videos featured here for this cologne. Splashing it wittily into an old school champagne glass. 
I guess 300 years of production proves it’s a classic worth owning. Need to find this again ASAP. Sharp, fresh, citrussy - it's all packed in oakmoss. That would normally sound good to me if it only haven't had such an old vibe to it. You can easy tell this was created long, loooong time ago.
I respect it's a classic, certainly refreshing one. I like to smell shower clean and fresh myself, but not like people 70 years ago, I wanna smell 21st century fresh.
Not my cup of tea, more into modern take on freshness. They smell very fresh, fruity, and a bit alcohol-ish (well it's the first ingredient). However, it smells like Garuda Indonesia's refreshing towelettes-- I don't know if they specifically use this for their towelettes, but because I smelled the towelettes before I smelled the perfume, the perfume reminded me of the towelettes more than the other way around xD
For such a beautifully packaged product, they're affordable and come in many sizes. As is with most EDCs their longevity and sillage aren't very impressive. I recommend buying the other lines of 4711 instead of the original, but you might wanna get this one for novelty. I was really eager to try this fragrance because of the supposed resemblance with Tom Ford Neroli Portofino which is one of my favorite summer scents, but too expensive regarding longevity... I bought 4711 in a box with a 200 ml bottle plus shower gel for 14 euros.
The first spray is so lemony and so fresh you would like to bath in it! Then after a few minutes you really can't tell the difference with Neroli Portofino: the freshest neroli ever!
However, on my skin, 4711 never evolves and disappears within an hour, whereas Portofino becomes sweeter and ambery and lingers as a skin scent for hours. 
So 4711 is really beautiful and I'll use it lavishly next summer to refresh but it does not compare with Neroli Portofino in terms of complexity and pleasure! This may sound a little random, but in case you didn’t know: 4711 also make the most wonderful moist hand wipes. Very handy while travelling, and far superior in scent to anything else out there. Bright, clean, fresh; really nice. (I just wish there was such thing as Egoiste Platinum wipes, or Chanel No. 22, or White Linen.....) At the start it smells very fresh a real blast from the past. Once it has settled down it is a very nice perfume 8/10 a real blast from the past 
- nice perfume :] I remember my mother giving this to me when I was 17, during a particularly hot summer and telling me to put it on whenever I felt too hot. 
This is a surprising memory to me because my mother very rarely had any interest in things like perfume or jewelry and this was not a perfume I had asked for. It was indeed pleasant and helpful for dealing with the summer heat that's all I remember. I love this stuff. Smells like fresh outdoors. If I could only own one perfume, this would be the one... regardless of longevity and sillage. Don't bother buying other pricier followers, just get the largest bottle of 4711 original and bathe in it. If you want the OG Neroli Portofino, here it is. Super affordable in comparison to Tom Ford! I love this stuff and was one of my first ever fragrances. It’s a lovely fresh out of the shower Mediterranean smell. I will always have a bottle of this in my collection. Smells exactly like Tom Ford Neroli Portofino and Oscar De La Renta Live In Love. Hell, Tom Ford even copied the bottle colors yet charges u hundreds of dollars more! Smells like wasabi! So strange but intriguing as well. Took me a couple of uses to actually like it but the dry down is nice and fresh.
Edit: The more I wear this the more I love it. It’s incredibly fresh and fun and for me a mood lifter. WHats even better is I love sharing fragrances with my bf and he loves it too. Smells just like lemon Pez candy tastes....and won't rot your teeth. Sweet and refreshing but also powdery/chalky. Nice for a short boost. Tried this just for fun at the local store, because I would like to know what kind of aroma has an antique cologne. The perfume pyramid is totally wrong in here. The opening with the blast of neroli, lemon, basil and rosemary is terrible and outdated, but few minutes later, when the stuff calms down, I get a great combination of lily, lavender, jasmine and rose. 1-1.5 hour later the the mid notes fades away, and got only a very light musky-woody base. Refreshing, after shower, go to bed cologne. But not for me 
- only for summertime/hot weather
- sillage and longevity are poor, longevity around 2-3 hours
- try befoe buy
Scent (open, top-mid): 4/10 (x2)

Longevity: 2.5/10
Uniqueness: 6/10
Versatility: 5/10
Total: 4.938/10 4711 is the best example of a true Eaux de Cologne. It's intent is to brighten one's day when the sun is blazing down on them and making them feel overheated and lethargic... a pick me up. Although shortlived, as all true eau de colognes should be, the candied citruses and soft white flowers are incredibly refreshing while they last. The notes say there's mosses and I take issue with that slightly, as traditional EDC fragrances don't usually contain such ingredients. Usually just top and middle notes, skipping the base. In any case, it's a true beauty. Comparable to Neroli Port. (was it a loving homage or a complete rip off?) and Cologne of Love by Couvents.
As it stands this is a true masterpiece, being passed through centuries from generation to generation. I like to just put a little in my hands, rub it together and just sniff away until its gone (usually 30-40 minutes, which is really quite good)
In regards to spending money on Eau de Colognes, I'd like them to be either cheap and fantastic (this) or superbly high quality and enjoyable to the very end (Guerlain's Eau de Cologne offerings and Chanel's)
10/10, really. Can't fault it. More aromatherapy than fragrance, but w/e My vote is number 1792 the year it created lol. Personally this is a sleeping pills for me. I don't care about longevity cause I use before bedtime on my pillows and blanket.Something oldie, citrus and herbs makes me calm. This is a nice one, I like it. Actual product review (got it in the mail today):
#1) Upon first ""sniff"", I immediately knew and felt WHY this classic has been in production since the late 1700s.
TOTALLY unisex, the composition is literally herbal, citrusy-slightly floral effing PERFECTION. 
Zero lasting power, as it's not a perfume proper but rather a cologne, and as such, it is perfect. 
I'm in 100% agreement with ladylva: 4711 is brilliant to use immediately after a shower while you're in your dressing robe applying lotions and cosmetics before getting dressed. The fresh, zesty sheer fragrance is a crisp, but very pleasant, waker-upper.
By the time you're ready for your day scent, this refreshing classic will either be a skin scent or disappear completely. But I think that's brilliant and precisely the function of a cologne. 
The scent is refreshing, herbal, citrus without being sharp, and herbaceously floral. This is a beautiful juice! Layer this with ISO E super and you have one amazingly smelling scent with moderate performance (better than 4711 alone). Don't bother buying Molecule 01 for £50 when you can buy 100ml ISO E Super from eBay for 1/5 of the price. Thank me later. I realize Neroli isn't listed, but orange is, and what I get from this classic cologne water is:
Neroli, vetiver, citrus!
It's strong, unisex, and timeless. It's also very short lived, but I don't think of this as a drawback. In some ways short longevity is a quality of 4711, because I cannot imagine wanting to smell this way ALL day. The brief, potent experience is enough, which is my personal commentary, not criticism! 
Naturally 4711 can be used in just the same way as Florida Water, for instance, and is a great childhood memory for many people. Before hand sani these were even used to sanitize, which I think is a superior, fragrant solution to germ killing... if not as portable. ;) @Countrygurl
Where do you live? In the city in where I live you can find it in almost all the shops, even in some supermarkets. Any stores sell this?( not online) This is an oldie goldie, and cheap as chips - I bought a large 300ml bottle for my dad for a few quid. Obviously, this is not a perfume, but a cologne, so do not expect anything in terms of sillage and longevity. This is intended to provide a quick pick-me-up in the morning, after shower, during the long scorching summer days and such. My dad has never been a perfume-wearing kind of guy, but he likes these simple colognes. Memories. This is the name I would give this fragrance if I could. It was very popular when I was a kid, my grandfather used to wear it, and so did many other older men I used to know. It's so fresh and crisp, smells like cleanliness. I plan on buying a small bottle when I have the chance, I did not see it for sale where I live, maybe I will find it in my holiday. Too many memories to miss it... I always love getting a hot wet hand towel and pour a generous helping on and steaming my face and cleaning my face off before bed go to bed smelling fresh and clean great night time ritual fun to have a few of different big bottles of the massive cheap splash colognes to experiment with, the water helps to dilute the fragrance enough to be able to clean your face of oils and dirt from the day and will not irritate your face leaves a wonderful aromatic smell to drift off into slumbery dream time , if you are highly sensitive to irritation then do not try this unless it's a small amount of splash I know many older people who wear this perfume. I don't blame them. It's great! This perfume opens up with natural, fresh lemon and bergamot notes. They smell very true to real citrus fruits. A woody dept sets in after ten minutes. This is nice. I can smell sweet florals a few hours later, right before it dissapears. This scent only lasts for three hours on my skin but that's okay. It's not a perfume for a hot date or club night. I would wear it during a long car ride or in a restaurant. It's subtile, refreshing and perfect for those occasions! I finally bought a bottle of this classic cologne. It's exactly what I'd hoped and expected it would be: a very light, refreshing citrus scent perfect for hot weather. The only notes I can detect are various citruses, neroli, petitgrain (though not in the notes pyramid), and jasmine. I don't get any of the base notes at all, but that's ok. This is for times when anything heavier or longer-lasting wouldn't be appealing anyway. I love the smell!
Is there any way to get it to last longer? i quite like citrusy fagrances and this one has something calming and timeless. the longevity isnt hreat but that is to be expected. i like it as a refreshing splash in hot days How to make your wardrobe less pretentious:
1. Spend a few dollars on a bottle of 4711;
2. Enjoy!
Inexpensive as it may be, there's a reason 4711 is still going strong - it's a timeless classic. Drugstore cheapies may come and go with the passing of each generation, but 4711 will outlive them all.
In essence, 4711 is the Eau de Cologne par excellence - citrus, florals and herbs in a concentration that begs to be splashed, sprayed and reapplied with abandon. Lemon, bergamot, basil and jasmine swirl into an olfactory illusion of neroli.
The closest cousin to 4711 is Guerlain's Eau de Cologne Imperiale, composed some seven decades later, and favoured by the French aristocracy. The differences are subtle; 4711 is lighter and more floral, while Imperiale is richer and more herbal, thanks to good doses of rosemary and verbena. Performance is roughly comparable, although 4711 has much more modest sillage. Still, it's perceptible as a skin scent more than a couple of hours in.
Those complaining about 4711's longevity need to cultivate a better understanding of the history and usage of Eaux de Cologne. To the enlightened, 4711 is perfect for its intended uses: as a pick-me-up in the heat; a quick refresher; a splash after a bath or shave; a source of relief and distraction from headaches and other pains. The list goes on.
A good Eau de Cologne is all about living in the moment, and embracing the peculiar exuberance that only a splash of bright citrus can bring. In that regard, 4711 is a very good cologne indeed. I have got it on winter and lemons feel so annoying in this time of the year.
In the summer I said.. cologne.. let me see ... I had my new Lucky Brand cotton top.. and I just sprayed after shower on my way for groceries.
Its totally different... in the summer.
I love it.. weathert is humid.. sunny.. and this scent just open up in warm months.
I have paid for my bottle $5.99 and I will buy more.
The bottle is made nice... oh yes yes I .. have stuff from Chanel Exclusifes.. but if you know the thigns are good you wil really appriciate it. 
Don't neglect it just because is 5 $ per bottle.
I really like... reminds me the other lemon bomb from Alvarez Gomez. This one is really similar to: Aqua de Colonia Concetrada.
I like it and I enjoying it on my clothes a lot.
Just because it cost 5$ doesn't mean is worse than Aqua Alegoria by Guerlain... :) Just because this product is in worse bottle...doesn't mean is worse than Guerlain.
Acctually the bottles are made really nice. Depends what size you will buy. I am not even German and this still smelled instantly nostalgic to me... Actually, my great aunt, of Swiss-German descent, may have had this stashed away somewhere in her old tudour manse in LA... it smells very Californian to me. Lemons, orange oil, a touch of sun tan lotion (no coconuts) and classic 1960's-70's cheap complementary hotel soap (take that Imaginary Authours/Maison Margiela!) with basil and a touch of old man oakmoss. I find the hotel soap white florals, basil and, wow, neroli, stick around on the skin for a pretty long time. A great refresher if you are wearing Eau Sauvage. I'll be spraying the frig out of this classic this summer (I have the spray format). 4711 is the quintessential definition of cologne.
Bergamot extraordinaire! I first encountered this in my parents' dresser when I was a child. I can't remember if it belonged to my mother or father -- splash bottle, rough paper label. I would sneak a whiff every now and again. That might have been when I was four, 1978.
Fast forward to my first trip on an aeroplane with my parents when I was 11, 1985, I was handed a warm terry towel by an air hostess, infused with something that smelled exactly like this scent. Refreshment for passengers waking up from a long international flight.
Back then too, hotels and restaurants would give you scented cloth towels to refresh you during meals in between courses. 4711 smells of old-school hospitality to me.
I won't bother to dissect this scent and give you a note analysis. Even with poor longevity and projection, at under $20 a bottle for practically any size or format (splash or spray), you can't afford to have this classic staple not have a place in your wardrobe. IMHO 4711 is the King of Citrus-Colonia. As simple as that. 4711 is nice summery light fragrance starting with neroli or something that makes me imaging it. After the initial burst of notes I do get something dry, vetiver/oakmoss perhaps with the neroli and some sweetness. Though the sweetness sadly disappears quite rapidly it still has some of it left with flowery undertone along vetiver/oakmoss and neroli. It’s nice scent, but rather common one.
The sillage is bit poor and longevity might be even poorer, but the scent is nice and I’d like to wear it more, but constant reapplying isn’t what I’m willing to do. Decent priced Edp of this would be nice (if it would solve the longevity), though the concept might be bit weird but I just like the scent and miss the longevity. As it is I have fun summer day with it every now and then. If one is willing to reapply it when the fragrance starts to wane it would be borderline great fragrance, sure it’s rather common and people might recognise it but for its price and scent I think it just is great. Very nice, very refreshing. Very linear, neroli and citrusy all along. Too bad the it has a very week performance, otherwise it would make to the top of my list. simply the best... let's drink it (lol) Oh I think this has more uses than what darmin suggests.
3. Getting in after a hot excursion or at the end of the day, wanting freshness but not wanting/able to turn on the air conditioner or fan just yet.
4. Had a gross encounter, want to wash it off, so splash some on your hands/cheeks.
5. Want to dedicate an activity or a moment as special, or worthy of quality attention, rather than the whole day.
6. Giving a complaining child a ritual to make themselves feel good, without making them smell perfumy (the kid wants a sensory experience, or to put on perfume just like you, or feels bad and wants some unusual, interesting expression of care)
7. Adding a splash to the bath.
8. You just need a wakeup call and want the message to sink in. This has two purposes only.
1: It is to wake you up after a shower and shave in the morning.
2: refresh you with an after work shower and splash.
Love it for sitting round the house and relaxing because its non exitent after ten minutes, but you feel great.
Cheap and worth it. 4711 is not to be used in the same way as our common fragrances, as it has poor silage and longevity. The scent, however, is an amazing ""refresher"", as it's fresh, energizing, and wonderfully ""organic"" (as opposed to ""synthetic""). My nose is normally very sensitive to citrus notes, but it takes well to 4711. I'd describe 4711 as a potion distilled with lots of lime, lemon, orange, their flesh, their skin, their leaves and their flowers. For me this is an after bath splash, fresh clean and wakes me. A unisex citrus scent. No long life, you will easily put something else on in half an hour to carry you the day, but nothing wakes you and says 'Good Morning Sunshine"" like 4711. Kind of a strange smelling perfume - smells like alcohol and kind of clinical to me - i use it as an aftershave and a true EDT even under the arms. great for daytime business wear. it has grown on me, though it took time. I liked this is a child but it seems so watery and nondescript now. I don't know if it has changed at all but it just doesn't have much of a smell for me. It is weak and doesn't last more than a few seconds. Also, it is not what I would call a scent I like - rather it is a scent I do not like. It is too insipid for me. I like depth and power in a scent with longevity and hopefully some sillage but this has none of these things. Good for a starter perfume before you know what you like I suppose. I thought it was going to be more citrus. I mean, citrus is obviously there but I get more of the green/herbal side of the composition.
It last nothing.
I truly prefer The Blood Orange or Mandarine editions.
But I know this is a ""cult"" fragrance and a lot of people have a sentimental attachment to it. So in that sense I understand the passionate devotion.
But to me it's just a fleeting cologne, zero longevity. I deliberately chose this fragrance as my first review as it is close to my heart. I became a perfume lover early in life, and a few have stuck with me. 4711 Original is one. Yes, it's a cheap drugstore cologne, but that is part of its charm. I loved it in the 1970s and saved a bit from my last bottle, so I could remember my beloved scent. It eventually dried up, but I never forgot it. I could not find it again until the advent of the internet which allowed me to renew my passion. 
It is not meant to dab on the wrist and behind the ears; it is not meant to spray into the air and walk through the mist. No, this is made to splash on joyfully, to pour handfuls and rub on your body. One who lives in a hot climate will appreciate it, as it will cool you, leaving you refreshed and smelling clean, then disappear, leaving you fresh without interfering with a scent you wish to wear later. 
As a kid, this is what blue-green smelled like to me. Coconut sunscreen smelled like the burning sun, and 4711 smelled like a shimmering blue pool. 
It's a bright, citrusy scent, lemon and lime to start, with a touch of sandalwood and certainly a light cedar or pine-something masculine. The dry down has a very clean lemony fruit with a very faint floral and woods. This smells like a complicated and simple scent at the same time. It's refreshing, like a child after swimming or clothes hanging on a line on a hot summer day, or perhaps a very handsome man fresh out of the shower shaving. Perhaps that's why it has lasted through generations. It will always be one of those evocative scents to me, reminding me of pools and cleanliness and cooling off on a day of stifling heat. Perhaps this is one of the first I ever tried, I can no longer remember but it is a part of me. 
For those who find old opened bottles in charity shops/thrift stores, I do not think you get the same scent. It is alcoholy (although it doesn't smell like alcohol) and the evaporation seems to change the smell, at least it did in my savored bottle, just enough to wonder if I really still loved it. (I do) This is a very cheap cologne belying the quality, and an investment that will not break most banks. A lovely starter scent for a teen, of both sexes. I love a cologne that comes in economy size, and others question if it's a bottle of liquor. It's great for those unbearable summer days in the city, and even better if you keep it cold for a refreshing splash. The OG cologne! Smells like citrus and citrusy flowers with a light musky base. It lasts for a hot second and is gone -- but I think colognes are supposed to do that, not last for hours and hours. It's a great way to refresh for a while, and is a fresh sensory experience. I like having a bottle of this around for the occasional pick-me-up! I like it, it smells like lemonade. but it does not last on my skin. Excellent , almost indispensable product.
Murray is NO option. Very bad quality ( allergies, it sticks to my skin)
This is GOOD. In my FRIDGE, and this summer I will splash again tis lovely COLD neroli meedicine-scent ! A classic. A little synthetic here and there, but people will not really notice. At the price it's sold, you can't argue. I add this to my bath when I want to relax. I splash some 4711 right out of the shower. By the time I get dressed the scent is gone, but again that is the beauty of an Eau de Cologne. It's not meant to last. After 4711 fades I will either spray on some of Guerlain's Eau de Cologne Imperiale or Christian Dior's original Eau Sauvage, depending on how I feel. 4711 will always remain a favorite in my collection. Recommended for daily use, especially in the spring and summer months. The dirt cheap version of Neroli Portofino. Non existent longevity and sillage, but at this price you could reapply it every 10 minutes and still not feel the pinch. A lovely clean, crisp fragrance that's perfect for a spring day. You don't survive 200 years without doing something right, this is a classic and should be a staple in everyone's rotation. Such a wonderful sent . If used as a splash , it will lift your spirits and leave you refreshed. Sure the resemblance to portifino neroli is there , but that's all. This last just long enough to take a deep , invigorating sniff. Enjoy and repeat. I'm seeing a lot of comparisons to Neroli Portofino, and honestly I don't get that. NP is very feminine on me, like a late spring morning, with white flowers in bloom in a citrus grove. 4711 starts out fresh but turns and makes me smell like I need a shower, even if I just took one. It just doesn't mesh with my skin. Maybe on men they smell the same, but on me it's a world of difference.
Edit: I see now why these are so different on me. 4711 has patchouli in it. NP does not. I have to be very careful with patchouli; it usually either becomes shrill and screechy on me, or it turns and makes me smell like a dirty hippie covered in grass stains. What a difference one note makes! Stunning, perfect, beautiful. Better than any other fragrance I've tried. Short lived but worth it. I'll just keep splashing it on. I love it. Review below from boruvka44 - very true and very funny LOL. smells weird in the bottle but refreshing when u spray it. doesn't last long but cheap so u can spray a lot throughout the day. a good aromatherapy mood enhancer. everyone keeps saying it, it's true. this is neroli portifino for a fraction of the price with only sightly worse performance. fine tradeoff if you ask me. I keep a bottle of this stuff in the car, gym bag and bathroom. it' makes me happy every time I smell it and on a hot day i spray it a lot. I'm a huge fan of Guerlain Eau de Cologne Impériale so I was very interest to see how this compared. I'd say it's definitely close but I still like the Guerlain better. The main differences I notice is that overall, 4711 is a little brighter and more floral, and starts off a little more medicinal. Impériale is more creamy and powdery with more lavender. Both are very light and short lived, so unless you're reapplying every 2-4 hours, it's just a fun luxury, feels refreshing while getting ready in the morning but don't expect many other people to notice. One thing I wish I had done was get a spray bottle rather than the flacon. It's hard for me to apply without dripping all over. My grandmother wore this as did my mother and now I am the third generation to adorn myself with this bright and cheery scent. Fresh, clean and crisp, like a smile in a bottle but like a smile it's there and then it's gone.I associate it with so many good memories.... I bought this because of the history behind it, and the fact that I love unisex citrus scents so I had a good feeling about this one. It's kind of funny so many reviewers here think this is only for men, because they advertised it to women quite aggressively in the mid-80s. 
It's a very clean, fresh and refreshing scent. I love it. I don't wear it much right now though, it's amazing in spring and summer but a bit out of place in winter. 
Interestingly enough, there is a Johnsons baby cologne called Heaven which is a nearly precise replica of this. It's very cheap, about $3.00 at any ethnic grocery store and it wears with 4711 wonderfully because it is an all over body splash as opposed to a cologne that you apply to pulse points. I tend to use both together because individually their silage is quite weak. After a night of insomnia when the first coffee of the day isn't cutting it, this is my go to first-aid saviour scent. 
Regardless of what the middle and base notes are supposed to be this scent doesn't hang around long enough to give you that treat. It's a firework of a fragrance - a cologne (which are never designed to last that long anyway) that has no staying power, but don't let that put you off. 
This is a splash-it-all-over the face number; a blast of all things citrus - lemon, orange and lime. It's an alarm clock for the flagging body, an ultimate fast hit of speed for the nose. 
Buy the 800ml and decant into a smaller bottle for carrying around to apPly often on a tired or hot day. At first I was a bit unsure about this one.
""Old scent"", I thought. Not exactly bad, at all, just a bit old.
I liberally splashed it all over my chest anyway (it sure was fun ahaha).
But once it was gone, which only took about 30mins, I started missing it... During those 30min it had succeeded to conquer my nose's love. :)
It's so invigorating!
Call me crazy, but to me it kinda smells like a wet orange tree. The entire tree.
Wet leaves, wet oranges, wet branches... There's also a wet lemon tree somewhere near :P
Too bad it doesn't last much. But since it's so cheap reapplying often isn't a biggie. I'm doing a back-to-back review of this and Tom Ford's Neroli Portofino. I could pretty much say the same thing as to me they are virtually identical. I thought I was the only one who noticed the similarity but I see many others have thought so.
My dad gave me a very small bottle of this as a souvenir from Cologne, Germany when I was in my teens. I thought it was super expensive because it smelled so nice, only to find out 300 years later (that's how old I feel) that you can buy a 300ml bottle for $17!? It probably cost that much back in 1792...
Who cares if it's got no longevity, at that price I can spray 100 times a day.
Like the Neroli Portofino, I can't decipher any one note but together you just get a very clean, fresh smell. I'd rather wear this than many of the more expensive, synthetic smelling perfumes. This is my after bath fragrance on days i don't go out. It reminds me so much of childhood when I'm feeling sick and my grandma would rub this on my head. I also enjoy this on warm, summer days when i just don't want to wear perfume. It's so comforting especially when it leaves the slightest calm, citrus smell on my clothes when the days ends. Adore the vintage bottle too."
