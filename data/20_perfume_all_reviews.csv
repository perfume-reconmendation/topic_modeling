CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","I needed to smell good for DeForest Kelley. It was mid-1998 and I had won Starlog magazine's ""A Date With Dr. McCoy"" contest. It was not a ""date"" in the romantic sense -- he and I were both married men with only baseline levels of physical attraction for one another -- but I still preferred to up my game ahead of meeting this TV icon. I slapped on some ""CK One"" and jogged to my jalopy.

As I strutted through the door of Taco Bell moments later, I spotted DeForest alone in the window booth. I loved how sexy I smelled. I half-expected DeForest to say, ""Dammit, Basil, I'm a celebrity, not a cheap lay!"" Instead, as I sat down across from him, he sneered and muttered, ""You smell like monkey-cage scrapings."" He snapped his fingers to summon his manager. The two men left without another word. So much for meeting an icon.

Life is about choices. Had I worn a better fragrance that day, perhaps DeForest Kelley would not have rejected me. Perhaps I would feel worthy as a human being. Perhaps it all would have been okay. ""CK One"" ruined me that day, but it need not ruin you. Please, gents, don't wear this one outside the house."

It’s incredibly crisp and refreshing, but quickly fleeting! I get a tangy citrus note with the backing of green tea and a slightly bitter green-ness. I love this fragrance so I would suggest getting the 6.7 oz if you can find it and reapplying as often as possible."
CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","Fresh, bright, effortless, androgynous and cool with sharp, clean green notes. A real summer pick-me-up.
I love wearing it on days I want to feel laid-back sexy rather than dolled-up sexy. This just conjures up images of skinny boyish 90s cool girls.
The scent actually reminds me a lot of the Bodyshop Fuji Green Tea range - I bet they layer beautifully after a shower - so this definitely smells more ""green"" than citrus on me, but that's not a bad thing.
I actually haven't smelt this on too many people IRL, but I know it is meant to be popular, which puts me off wearing it somewhat for fear of smelling ""obvious"". That being said, the trend graph does suggest interest in this perfume waning, which could be a good thing for bringing back a bit of uniqueness to a classic whose only drawback is its own popularity!"

If you're concerned about smelling original or unique then this isn't the fragrance for you because the popularity is undeniable.

However, the more I returned to the scent, the more like a cleaning product it smelled to me. Lemon Windex? Nonetheless, it layers very nicely with the organic sweetness of D&G's Light Blue which tempers the synthetic lemon and creates a light but fairly complex citrus scent. Totally unisex and timeless-- a clean, bright scent that would be appropriate for most occasions. You can't go wrong with it, but you certainly won't stand out either."

I think it's really cool, fresh, citrusy scent, but it still smells fruity. In summer, I like to wear it in the very heat, or at home, for example, when cleaning or after morning workouts and showers. I think it's a super everyday fragrance. There's nothing intrusive about it. Clean, easy to wear, absolutely unisex. Longevity is great, even on my skin, but especially on clothes."

I thought well damn this smells just as Good as I remember ck1 smelling. I thought let me buy an authentic bottle of it since it’s a classic and it’s still smells delicious. Well I thought wrong. It’s powdery and tweaked way too much. It just doesn’t perform like it used to. I’ll wear it til it’s gone and forever leave it in the past."

Where to start, this fragrance is what originally got me into citrus fragrances. For the longest time when ever I smelled citrus I could only think of cleaning products. Luckily I smelled this when I did because sense then it has opened a whole new world to me.

CK ONE has a pineapple opening but it's very distinct it's one of those things where it's hard to describe to someone unless they have smelled it as well.

Honestly this is a great fragrance for any age point be it 14 or 80. Great buy for the price lovely warm weather fragrance.

Projection 5/10 Very personal scent.

Sillage 5/10 It's in the air but it's not refer to above.

Longevity 4/10 It's a freshy but it does not last as long as other alternatives.

Scent 7/10 This is where this fragrance really makes up ground.

CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']",I remember this fragrance from when I was in high school in the mid 90s. A neighbor/teacher that I would catch a ride to school with practically bathed in this stuff. It was super trendy. I have a new bottle and I believe it’s fruiter smelling than it used to be. The initial smell before the dry down reminds me a little bit of Froot Loops cereal.
CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","A perfectly unisex fragrance that will have you smelling fresh and clean for a fantastic price. It opens up with bright citruses, and as it dries down, all the floral notes and the green notes come through. The green notes give a dewy vibe, so along with the floral accords, it smells like a fresh spring garden. Throughout the whole lifespan of the fragrance, the musk is quite prominent too, which gives it a bit more depth and intrigue, and balances out the florals to make it more unisex.

Performance is moderate, but better than expected given that it's a fresh, cheaper fragrance. Of course, it's nothing groundbreaking, but it's so difficult to dislike, and at such a low price point, is a fantastic fragrance for any occasion, especially for the warmer weather."

One sniff and it immediately takes me back. I still have my bottle. It has hardly any left. Now I just save it for the memories. In 1994, Calvin Klein advertising was everything. Wearing a unisex fragrance made us feel like we were shunning the high school girl norms. While our classmates were drowning themselves in cucumber melon or Clinique Happy and others I don’t remember, my best friend and I thought we were oh so edgy in our ck One. I still like the smell, but it’s nothing I would wear today. I’m practically anti citrus & fresh scents now. But at the time, Calvin knew how to make citrus fresh and clean SO sexy. As odd as it sounds, when I wasn’t wearing this I was dousing myself in patchouli oil, which I still love to this day."

It was so strange, like this after-cloud of someone with bad hygiene. I have no idea what was happening or why it went so sour on me but unfortunately this one really does not agree with my body chemistry.

We don’t need to smell like a king every where we go at all times plus let’s consider the younger demographic that will appreciate this like we used to do back in the day. My BEST advice, grab this bcs it’s super affordable and bathe in it and then layer it with Acua Di Gio. Your good stuff will last longer and you’ll smell good all the way around and you won’t need to worry about losing or break your good bottle and just leave the CK in the glove box or gym bag."
CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","The beginning of this perfume feels rather masculine to me (because of the strong citrus notes). However, as it starts to dry down, I can see how it leans towards a more unisex smell. I would say it smells quite soapy and citrusy. It is quite inoffensive and a very mass-appealing scent, something you could find in everything from body soaps to deodorants. Probably a very good choice when you want to smell clean and approachable.

CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']",I would say it is a very safe but. Not fruity or floral but more ozonic green fresh. I loved wearing this in the 90s and I went and bought myself a bottle about 5 years ago knowing I already love it I could just get another one (I was in the hunt for perfumes). The memories from the 90s were too strong and I returned the bottle. They were not bad memories at all but it reminded me I smelled like the 90s and I could not stand it! Now any perfume that resembles that smell or memorie is a big no no for me! Great scent but it needs to stay in the 90s!
CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","A great fragrance. Mass appeal, cult following, universal use - it is what it is.

However many people have been overexposed to it. We find similar notes in air freshners, shampoos, shower gels. It's versatility makes it a safe choise, devoid of true originality. It's not a bad thing sometimes. You can use it anywhere, anytime.

However I noticed there are many similar fragrances and homage clones worth mentioning (if you cannot afford the real thing or want to save some money).

A worthy mention could be:
Lidl Aura Unicke – Smells like Calvin Klein’s One original formula."

It was so ubiquitous during my teenage years that I grew sick of it - over-sprayed by obnoxious, hormonal teenage boys in my high school. Ugh. Sadly, it will forever be stuck in that negative scent memory for me. That doesn't mean it's not a good fragrance!! It has its place in fragrance history and luckily for those who love it, it's still being produced and is easy to find in the marketplace today. One must acknowledge its importance (in the US at least) as a trailblazer for unisex fragrances, being the first unisex scent to be hugely popular in this country. I actually love unisex fragrances now and mostly wear citrus/fresh scents so while CK One should be right up my alley, I can't go near a bottle! Scent memory is too strong."

So this is a reach scent when you need a pick me up. I appreciate this is one i could share with my girlfriend. I still think CK Be is better but it doesn't mean this one is a bad choice."

CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","I wore this a lot 25 years ago.
To my knowledge, this was the first, or one of the first, unisex fragrances.

Now, almost everything is listed as unisex even if it's not (looking at you bond no 9)

I don't have a problem with that, wear whatever you want. I occasionally wear a couple womens fragrances.

In any case, this was the true swiss army knife of fragrance. Could be used in just about any casual situation.

This was groundbreaking in another way that it was a much lighter fragrance than many of the 80's and 90's powerhouse scents that came before it.

Definitely a classic that established the fresh and clean genre of fragrances."
CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","It might be hard to write a review that does this scent justice. How do you review a fragrance that was so iconic it anchored an entire generation, nay, generations? Boomers, Gen X and millennials all have a special spot in their hippocampus for CK One. Like many of you I'm sure, 2020 and 2021 have made me so disgustingly nostalgic for the past. The past we took for granted. Clubbing, dining, even just walking down the damn street. We took all that shit for granted!

Anyway, I've been listening to a lot of Utopia on Sirius radio. It's the station for dance hits from the 90s and 2000s. While listening to the remix of Deborah Cox's ""Nobody's Supposed to Be Here,"" I felt this painful gnaw of nostalgia, that same ache which scents like CK One give me. Actually, smelling CK One first makes me think of the Designer Imposter ""U"" that I owned at the time. The real thing was definitely out of my price range but the dupe was pretty good. After ""U"" my second memory is of the 7th grade dance. CeCe Peniston, La Bouche, Everything But the Girl. Plaid polyester and spaghetti straps. Steve Madden version 1.0. Were the mid 90s not the most innocent and invigorating time? Depending on your age you'll have a different answer.

Perfume is armchair time-travel."

The current version smells nothing like CK One in the 90‘s when it came out. It was a pure crisp green sweet citrus. Now it‘s powdery, balsamic and nutmeg with a citrus hint. It was a revolution when it came out and the campaign pictures were very androgynous and sexy. Yes, Kate Moss was one of the models but the pictures always showed a crowd of people and were all black and white, all wearing jeans and white tank tops. CK One would organize underground parties with lots of creative crowd in Paris where I lived. It was the hipsters of the 90‘s, before the word was even invented. These days you find CK One being sold at your local drugstore where they also sell toilet paper. vitamins and hair color."

I wouldn't wear it myself but I don't think you can go wrong with it. Which is probably why it's a classic :)"

I have a very unique skin temperature, it sucks all the top notes like in the 1-2 minutes away.. to have it's top notes noticable on me is a great achievement in it's own way. For the price, I think it's a good catch for whoever love classic fresh fragrances"
CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","A solid like, but definitely not a love. I like the whiff of its scent in the air, which is fresh and clean, clean, clean. But when I sniff at my wrist with my nose pretty close to my skin, the scent is slightly different - more powdery maybe? I don't know, but I remember this fragrance to be much more rounded in its edges, though perhaps it's just my memory playing tricks on me. All in all, a good fragrance for when you want to smell clean and neutral, though this smells more masculine than feminine to my nose, but it still is unisex.

EDIT: Oh my! This might get bumped up to a 'love' for me! Not as a body fragrance, though. I spritzed this on my bedsheet, blanket and pillows, and would you know it - it works wonders! Used this way, my room smells fresh and clean and I slept like a baby! So cozy and refreshing at the same time!"

I know what you're thinking and to be totally honest, I am also thinking it; what else can can be said thats not been said already?
Well, I wasn't actually a teen when this fragrance came out, so when I first smelt it, it was a whole new experience for me, it was a scent I actually wanted to smell of, clean, not overly masculine, just nice and neutral. Its a scent for people that dont like scent, dont want to wear anything olfactively challenging or just want to smell and feel clean, CK One on my skin is mostly lemon mixed with tea and cadromom, light floral accents from lily of the valley and a woody base of cedar and musk help to anchor everything into place, its vibrant, easy to wear and fresh, suitable for office wear, gym wear and so on.

Longevity is not amazing given that its a citrus based scent, but I manage to pull 5 hours from 5 sprays with a gentle ""wafty"" clean silage. Its widely available and very reasonably priced, so I'd happily buy this again, its a fail safe wardrobe staple like CK All is, spray it with abandon and enjoy!"
CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","On me this is citrus and green, until the dry down, after which I am left with only a light, slightly floral musk. I like what is left after the dry down, but it doesn't rock my world. I see how this would be a ""safe"" fragrance for the office or for someone who doesn't want a lot of sillage. It is a nice, balanced scent - I can easily see why others like it. It's just not going to be a favorite for me."
CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","Nice smell, it gives me a citrusy-soap vibe like if you just got out of a bath.

CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","This was groundbreaking in the beginning of the 90's. The thought of mixing ""male"" and ""female"" accords into a scent was somehow very bold, coming out of the 80's with power suits and Venice beach bodies...

It's not bold, of course, but still just a great fragance from that era. It was my signature for all thoose years from 94-99, i had just one perfume for day, night, spring, fall, etc, and it was CK.

My friends all said i was a poster boy for the metrosexual kid, growing up playing guitar in a rock band, dropping out of higher education, rather wanna travel the world, meet people, seeing countries, etc. There was nothing like the ""scent of the day"" and all that stuff. No collections of fragances, no office to go to, everything i had was two suitcases with clothes and a guitar and....my CK-bottle.

My taste changed over the years. Citrus is not something i reach for when i choose a perfume, not as a dominant accord if you now what i mean. That doesn´t mean it´s boring or whatever, no. But today i need a bit more deep and complex blends to go crazy over a scent.

But make no mistake: CK is minimalism at it's best. It's a must try for all of us. Clean sheets, and later...dirty minds....

It doesn’t really smell of a spray type fragrance. It just smells soapy and clean. It’s a shower fresh smell. The citrus in this is pretty tame just the way I like it.

It gets pretty light on the skin quickly after spraying. I’m not sure if I’d be able to identify this fragrance as a person wearing an edt vs someone just stepping out of the shower. Also, I can agree it is unisex because it smells like basic soap. However, I think I’d have a hard time convincing my male friends and family members to try it out. I would think they would say it smells too feminine leaning based on comments they have made on other fragrances."

Unfortunately, the shipping box was damaged and the perfume leaked. Wow, the box was aromatic. We're having some renovations at our house, and the construction crew all recognized it.

It's not the most complex thing going, but ckone is a great summer freshy."

I'd say it's unisex, but leaning more on the masculine side potentially.

It's summer in a bottle and a staple in my collection.

Wouldn't use for an evening or a night out, unless I'm backpacking and haven't brought anything more expensive for the fear of losing it, having it stolen or damaged.

Wouldn't buy it as a gift either.

Can't go wrong! A safe blind-purchase."

CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","I remember when this fragrance launched. My local mall distributed 3mL sample vials in a brushed metal packaging. I remember smelling it and really liking it. I never got around to getting my own bottle in the 90's because my best friend at the time thought it reeked and preferred Calvin Klein's Escape. Of course, my friend's opinions were always way more important back then!

I scored a free bottle in 2010, and I've worn it on and off since then. The smell of CKone is a very distinct one, but it's not one that I want to smell of anymore. I wish I had enjoyed it back in the 90's and left it there. I still think it's a pleasant smell, but it's a little too ""cold"" and sharp for my personal tastes. I think I'll use it up as a room spray."
CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","Calvin Klein CK One Unisex EDT opens with a moderate projection of mostly citrus and green accords. The opening is soft, unisex, fresh, common, and OK. The sharpness of the citrus notes is noticeable but short-lived, the fragrance develops a soft musky and powdery note, resulting from the musk, violet, and amber. The green notes are soft but noticeable, a fresh, grassy, greenery note. The musky note grows as time passes, the floral notes also become noticeable and the resulting scent leans to white florals creating a slight feminine touch. The fragrance contains several other notes, but they are not prominent, they come up as a faint fruity, spicy, and woody touch. The fragrance has one noticeable opening to dry-down change, the citrus notes dominate the opening and are very sharp, but that changes quickly, these citrus notes get enveloped by a powdery, musky, and projecting accord, simultaneously, the floral notes come up and become noticeable and the initial moderate projection takes one step down to low. Once Calvin Klein CK One Unisex EDT has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a soft projection, slightly sweet, musky powdery, green, citrus, and white floral fragrance with woody accords. The fragrance feels airy, breezy, casual, delicate, diluted, diurnal, dry, elegant, faint, feminine, floral, fresh, green, light, modern, musky, short-lived, slightly sour, sporty, unisex, white, and pleasant.

BATCH REVIEWED: #9099.

SEASONS: Spring, summer.
OCCASIONS: Formal events, outdoor gatherings, gym, office, business, casual, holidays, vacations, romantic, dating, clubbing. This is an office-friendly fragrance.
VERSATILITY: 6/10. A short-lived, faint, but versatile fragrance for warm weather.
GENDER: Advertised for men, the white floral notes, and the lack of any masculine notes (tobacco, spices, dark woods, etc.), create a unisex fragrance slightly tilted to the feminine side.
AGES: Any.
RECOMMENDATION: Calvin Klein CK One Unisex EDT is a very affordable fragrance, versatile but nothing groundbreaking. It is a nice-to-have, but not a must-have.
BLIND-BUY: No, the powdery musk and white florals create a slight tilt to the feminine side. Sample it first.
SIMILAR: These are examples of fragrances in the same genre.

CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","Very 90s. Like, Leonardo and Claire Danes probably wore this in the 1996 Romeo & Juliet. It's that 90s. If you were around back then you likely remember the marketing. As a result it's very familiar to a lot of people now.

It's a ""fresh"" fragrance. I get equal parts ""citrus-y,"" equal party ""flower-y."" Consistent with the unisex designation, it gives me an androgynous vibe. On me it dries down more or less as it goes on, stays fruity/floral throughout.

Silliage is fair. Longevity is moderate. My skin absorbs colognes pretty fast. I'd say with this one I get 5-5.5 hours max, usually more like 4+. I spray it pretty liberally, 5-8 sprays, and still that's all I get.

I rarely if ever get comments on this one way or another. Maybe because it's so ubiquitous and generic now. Given what 80s scents were like, I can see how it was a shift in the 90s, but now seems run of the mill. Good for warmer weather in spring-summer.

I never go wrong wearing this as a 30s male. It's inoffensive and doesn't stand out, leaves you smelling fresh. But I don't get many compliments on it either."

Overall a pleasant scent, but this has been copied so so so much that everyone has some kind of memory associated with this type of scent.

Smells nothing like Chrome or Paco.

Performance is dismal.

There are better scents even from CK right about now. No need to get this in my mind.

It is a bit dated for sure."

So, it was a very happy surprise for me when I found a 5mL bottle in amongst some old boxes I was going through.

Well, either my nose has completely changed or the bottle has, because it doesn't smell anything like I remember!

I remember it as citrus-heavy and bright, and very green and fresh. Leaning toward the ""masculine"" side. Now, I perceive it as very soapy, and more feminine. I still get citrus in the opening, but it's nothing to write home about.

I definitely wouldn't buy it again, and instead will remember it fondly from my younger days."

CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","Ah CK One. Considered to be a bit of a classic. I remember smelling this back in the days and thinking it smelled quite fresh. Bought a bottle lately for pizza money, figured out it would be a nice enough summer scent. Well sometimes buying perfume on the basis of a quick paper strip test is a form of gambling. Chalk it up as a loss.

CK One starts off with some damp citrus and fruity notes with a muted feminine floral array lurking underneath. There is something familiar about it. The image that slowly materializes is that this smells like Acqua Di Gio for men who wear handbags. I mean I do have one too but only carry really manly shit in it like booze, cigars, vintage Playboys, steaks, big dogs and power tools.

I can't shake the impression that CK One smells like a watered down feminine perfume that is too boring to make anyone more alluring unless you live in a place where there is no running water. You might say it extends the coming out of the shower feeling but to me you will just smell like a person who doesn't know how to properly rinse off the soap you goddamn dummy. It smells cheap and barely fresh in a way that suggest a common household product.

Wish I bought that pizza. Pizza is truly unisex and smells better. There is a new place here that sells Italian style pizza, dude was in Italy for four months WOW! I put on CK One when I started to write this review and now it is just a boring hum. I recommend getting a decent citrus cologne over this. It is a bad perfume, an eau that belongs in the toilet. Zero points and five poopy emojis is my final verdict.

P.S. The shower gel is also bad. I mean it is a functional product and (probably) gets the Corona particles out of your bosom and bum but the structure is crap and using it makes me feel like a Barbie house is waiting behind the bathroom door when I get done with the joyless scrubbing. It smells like plastic and gives me nightmares of spending the rest of my life quarantined alone with a blowup doll. I'll save it for special occasions like when I have food poisoning or something equally disastrous."

I wanted to compare it against this, which I have smelled frequently though the years (usually on men), because I ALSO received a bonus complimentary decant of this when I ordered something else. So it's been a good old fashioned CK spree for me, all for free, and thanks to the kindness of other fragheads <3

This has always been a slightly masculine, soapy green scent. The citrus is pretty tart and bordering on bitter in the opening (not a criticism, I love it), and it's a perfect out-of-the-shower scent. It's a classic piece at this time, and I do truly feel that it can be worn by all. It evokes fresh, cool air, clean white Tshirts, sunlight and springtime. Without the note pyramid to help, it's green lily of the valley with bergamot. On me, it lasts about 3 hours and wood with musk remains.

There's nothing very sweet in here (my nose fails to get thr pineapple), but it's inoffensive and stays on a moderate leash, and could easily be worn to the gym or to casual things. It's nostalgic in all the right reasons, and wonderfully tomboyish."

Grant it I have an older batch but it doesn’t really smell off so maybe it’s not accurate but I get a fresh Citrus blast at the beginning, kind of like a more masculine and mature version of Canoe then it recedes into a soapy, lavender smell.it is very fresh and pleasing but it doesn’t seem to last very long and isn’t too complex. Again maybe my batch has lost some of its muster since it’s old but I really just get soapy lavender and some citrus. It isn’t bad at all but not entirely complex either.

For me what is importnant that on me it is such a fresh citrus-musk-violet smell. Not very intensive but lasting, close to the skin.

A classic in my books."

CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","A lot of cosmetic/beauty supplies mimic this scent and a lot of stores use this as an ambient scent. So, trust me when I say this, you have definitely smelled this at some point in your life whether you're 10, 20, or 50.

It's essentially a really soft and clean citrusy-floral scent with a slight sweetness to it which resembles that found in certain body lotions - mostly women's lotions.

Having said that, this is 100% unisex but more feminine-leaning and easier to pull off for a woman due to that creamy-sweet lotion nuance."
CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","I get citrus in the beginning and a little bit of tea in the dry down. Other than that it’s straight up 2000s freshie, loaded up with artificial greenery. It’s totally unisex, simplistic to the point of forgettable, and casual. Moderate longevity and close to skin sillage."
CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","Simply beautiful, non-cloying citrus-floral combo freshie. The citrus part is a cocktail of bright fruits, whilst the floral chord is subtle but gives the perfume a serious differential to everything that ever existed before and everything that still exists today in terms of open citruses. Perfect super hot summer frag. On the shelf of monstrous commercial successes of Morillas (alongside indisputable Acqua di Gio and 212 NYC), it asserts itself, in my judgment, as the most balanced of them and an eternal must-have in any good smelling closet, be it for the absurd high quality and excellent result for designer standards, be it for the great performance for the freshie proposal, be it for the absurdly inviting price tag."
CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","It definitely leans more toward feminine... The Rose is quite strong in this one. It could just be my bottle though. I still enjoy this fragrance a lot though. It doesn't project very well, but with enough sprays (10 for me) I can get about 6 hours of good performance. Solid scent. Will definitely purchase a bigger bottle when I run out. With the purchase."

It's a nice daytime perfume, moderately lasting on skin and clothes, but if you reapply it, it's still inoffensive, it's fresh but not sharp. More for women than men.
I am 28, I see it as the perfect perfume for my age. I don't see it fitting a 17 year old.
Such a good combination of notes."
CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","Smells very soapy and clean, like you've just got out of a fresh shower. Is not really catchy or mesmerizing, so if you're trying to wear a fragrance to make you more sexy, it wouldn't be the best choice. In fact, one might just assume you just got out of the shower, and that's what you smell like.

However, it does smell very pleasant, it's very discrete, very long lasting for me as well, I'm not sure why it has such bad votes on longevity, it's lasting for over 7 hours on my skin.

It's unisex, because the ""fresh"" smell you get from it, doesn't really have anything masculine or feminine in it, it's just... clean.

Clean is really the one word you can use to sum up this whole fragrance, and the perception people are going to get for you when they smell it on you.


Overall, nothing too crazy, but considering how cheap it is and the performance, I'd rate it a strong 7/10. Very good for casual summer/spring occasions when you just want to boost your overall appeal without going to obvious about it."

CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","I used CK One for 10 years and I'm sure at least 50 strangers, from every gender and orientation, approached and asked me what this amazing smell was. While sitting in a cafe, waiting on a line, in elevator, people even stopped me while I was walking down the street. I remember one elderly female neighbor instantly hugged me with closed eyes while uttering ""ooo my good this smells perfect"". I also remember that when I changed my perfume to something else, several of my friends got upset because they couldn't smell it anymore. Either it goes perfectly with my skin or CK one is magical. It lasted on my skin for days even after a bath, and it even lasted longer on my clothes even after washing. If it doesn't last on your skin, it could be caused by two things: first, your skin may be too dry. Dry skin doesn't hold perfume well, so make sure your skin is hydrated. Second, your batch could be old. I couldn't find the magic of CK One in other perfumes. Still searching."
CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","For me this starts as a musky water scent and then dries down to a spicy clean scent. It is a nice timeless unisex which is usually what I prefer for office use or a middle of the day refresher. Back in the day I would wear men's scents like Obsession because they worked better with my skin chemistry and I prefer a warmer scent over a flowery scent. I like that CK One is different on everyone who wears it. I have the body wash, too, and it matches the spray perfectly."

CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","it's a nice gluey citrus scent leading into some pleasant florals, and a very light ambery spicy base deep down in the base.

Most fragrances I have are more complex, provocative, enticing, musky, earthy etc, but sometimes, simple and easy is nice, and what I am looking for at the moment.

I never wore this, or thought it would be interesting at all when I saw those ads when it first came out, and lemon scents are not really my interest, but this one is not really a yellow lemon.

What I like about this one is it smells pretty good for what it is, for one - its not an aquatic (the genre I dislike the most for scent).

This one has a almost gluey smell of citrus and some florals which come in and they are pleasant. There is a very light amber and spice in the base. It actually smells pretty good for a simple easy going scent, with some soft interesting light complexity.

I tried it a few times at the store, and got myself a bottle."

CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","Yes, another 90s person is here to say this is an iconic fragrance. I was a freshman in high school when it came out. I lived in a fairly large city with fairly small town, narrow minded attitudes. I was the only kid into Britrock and elephant flares, tiny band t-shirts and whatever skate sneaker was around. I wasn't into grunge, I was a girl who wanted to be someone between Liam Gallagher (i even had my cut my hair like him) and Louise Wener, with a heavy Smiths obsession. I was not considered cool in my city, but strange and moody. I wanted not to be there. This scent, along with a fantastic music collection, courtesy of my 10 yrs older AOL chat buddy/symbolically adopted older brother from Chicago, helped transport me and let me escape.
I had one local BFF and all we did (could do) was sit at the mall and people watch. One time some jocks from school got in a fight practically on top of us and got blood all over the Smiths denim jacket my grandma had custom made me. My BFFs mom hand washed it for me in her bathtub, and joked that she almost got high from the stench of CK One emanating from the hot water!
lol I will always remember that.

I own a mini bottle, so far just for nostalgically sniffing - - the sense memories of the quite dark emotional turmoil of that time make me hesitant to actually wear it.

However, there is no denying that it's a magnificent citrus scent that has aged amazingly well. You will obviously have memories attached to it if you grew up with it... Again, in my city, kids were NOT into this. It was considered for freaks and weirdos, or maybe older junkie types. So, for me, it is MY scent, not the scent of a generation.
I am a bit of a masochist about purposely putting myself into memories that weren't that good (of course, i love positive nostalgia just as much, though!), so I hope to always have a bottle of this to sniff and remember the magic of blasting Oasis albums by myself in the living room when my parents went out, wishing i were somewhere much cooler.

If you don't have any memories attached to it, then just try it - - it is a truly unique scent and they DID nail the unisex thing. Personally, I think it's a shame to dismiss it solely because of its age or nostalgia, because when totally removed of any concepts, it's just a very confident and fresh scent that i dont find similar to anything else. Although young people may sometimes fall for a good ad campaign, I find it hard to believe it would've been THAT ubiquitous in most places based purely on some hot models. I mean look at my city: the ad campaign was why it was UNpopular! The fact is it was a widely appealing scent then and I think it still is now."

Yes, there is a refreshing quality in it due to the citrus, but to my nose, it feels like there is something deep, dark and sexy that lurks behind this 'fresh, clean' façade.

For some reason whenever I sniff this, it strikes me as deeply erotic. Musky, intriguing, seductive. There is a 'bad girl'/ 'bad guy' vibe in this perfume. Whoever wears it, needs to have confidence, charisma and sex appeal. Sort of a 'I don't care, I know I'm sexy' sort of attitude, without it being arrogant or over the top.

A firm favourite during my teenage years and early twenties, I'll always remember this scent fondly."

It's been my work perfume for years because it's so pleasant and fresh. It transforms into a light skin scent that compliments deodorant and fresh clothes perfectly.

I've also had compliments from men on this perfume, despite it not being particularly feminine. On a warm night, CK One smells different - lemony and green and androgynous.

It's gorgeous, but if you're after something overtly sexy, feminine or sweet it won't be for you. It never became my signature for this reason - I just craved something a little sweeter and creamier."

Fresh, citrus, subtly spicy and floral. On my boyfriend the spice and floral is more pronounced and smells amazing.

This one can go south if your skin rejects it with nasty body odor smell, most likely attributed to the cardamom. Luckily, it's not the case for everyone.

Worth a try - especially at the affordable price. CLASSIC & NOSTALGIC"

Pleasant citrus and floral, I get 1-2hrs soft projection and then skin scent for about 3-4hrs.

But, despite this,I like it, but will be not rebuying it due to poor longevity.( or perhaps I do not feel it, as people around me are commenting about the fresh and nice trail of smell I leave behind) 🙂.
Nice to have if you want a neutral smell. Good for office environment .

A refreshing and light spring and summer scent, it’s inoffensive, clean, and was truly revolutionary when it was first released, it’s hard not to enjoy it based on this merit alone! One of the best scents from CK, and still stands the test of time. While some CK scents get really boring and played out, for some reason this one doesn’t. It grows on you (example: I absolutely loved Euphoria when I first smelled it, and disliked ck one. Now I love CK one and dislike Euphoria, strange but true!).

If you are a guy and find this one a touch too feminine, try CK All! I find it to be quite a bit better than CK one, in terms of scent, longevity and projection, and it’s more masculine to my nose.

If you're born after 1995, avoid this like hell. You'll never understand it.

Best way I can describe this in modern terms is Versace Pour Homme's retarded little cousin. 20-30 mins and its gone from your skin even after 4 sprays. Terrible, terrible projection. Absolutely no sillage. I put 7 sprays before going to the grocery store just to smell nice, back less than 25 mins later and already no trace of it.

So, if you're looking for a signature scent, a main daily scent? Forget it. Stay away.
If you're looking to expand your collection by adding something just for the fun of it? Sure, why no.
If you're into nostalgia, like me, this is a cheap fragrance so why not. I bought it just to have it, because it reminds me of those days we got VHS tapes and audio casettes of Michael Jackson, Backstreet Boys, Spice Girls. That old party scent. Here's for the good times, the ""old"" times.

P.S. - In modern times, this scent is an exact reason of why Fragrantica should add something between Like and Dislike, called 'Tolerable/Able to tolerate'."

Initially, this has one of the best, citrus openings you will ever smell. It should only be applied under 25 degrees Celcius otherwise it begins to smells bitter and horrible. After the citrus opening dries down it smells exactly like fresh, clean laundry. Its a nice, fresh smell, don't over do it with the sprays though or it will give you a headache.

which I only now tried out for the first time. What can I say?
My first thought was ""Hm. Boring. Smells just like soap.""

Now, seeing that this came out in 1994, I should acknowledge
that it has aged remarkably well. At the time, it must have been
quite innovative: Fresh, subtle, unisex, it showed that perfumes
didn't have to be overpowering, in-your-face ""masculine""
(whatever that means) in the style of Kouros, Drakkar Noir etc. in
order to be elegant.

It is hard to dislike this. In an alignment chart of fragrances,
this one is ""True Neutral"". It's not the kind of scent that you
immediately fall in love with, either. ""Clean"" and ""inoffensive""
are words other reviewers have used to describe it. True, that.
It smells just like soap."

Easily dismissed today as a cliché that inspired the contemporary fascination with all things lemon for men, but that's unfair. CK One was an icon of its time. It came in an iconic bottle with a delicate little silver top and was the scent that drew me into the fragrance world. I wouldn't wear it now as it's too light and summery for me, but on a teenager it would still work great!

Update, May 2019: My local pharmacy has been selling 200ml bottles for £20. I had forgotten just how good, how fresh and endearing this was. I couldn't resist a sniff and, by surprise, it doesn't seem as light as I remember. A reminder of good, fun times. I'm in love again. Yes, I bought it!"

I think fondly of a scent memory, of when I first tried this in the mall that was attached to a movie theater, when I went to see the movie Little Women with Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Kirsten Dunst, etc. in '94. All in all, a great scent that I think most people will like if they're into fresh smells."

CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","Really beautifully put together scent that’s prettty basic and safe and not exactly a favorite of mine but it’s a scent I’ll always have in my collection.

This opens up very soapy,citrusy, bright and with some florals and in the opening it’s quite feminine for my liking but as thisdries down it does become more unisex. This heads into the drydown pretty quick and this scent doesn’t change much but as it develops CK One gets more creamy,smooth but at the same time more musky as well. If this wasn’t as musky this scent would be an easy love and not a like. In the drydown this becomes perfectly unisex as it’s simply afresh,out of the shower,creamy soap type of smell. Very pleasant but can be boring pretty quick.

This is also compared to Chrome and I can definitely see the comparison. The differences being are that the metallic note and apple in Chrome help it to be more bold and masculin.

Performance- people on here are saying this doesn’t perform but on my skin I get 4-6 hours with decent projection actually. This also leaves a lovely scent trail !

Overall rating-7 out of 10 ! Nothing amazing but it is a good,refreshing pick me up scent when you just want to smell clean."

CK One is the ultimate 'easy grab' fragrance for anyone of any age and in almost any situation, which makes it such a perfect choice as a gift, no doubt this is why it's still around after all these years.

There's nothing shocking or indeed stunning about this scent but it's...nice! Refreshing, comforting, clean, lightly spicy, floral, citrusy and slightly sweet.

I tried this recently at a duty free and seven plus hours later, despite twice washing my hands I could still smell it as a skin scent. It's not very strong beyond the first 3O minutes or so though, still a timeless fragrance in a similar way to CK Be (although 'Be' is even softer!)."

On my skin CK One starts of with a blast of freshness. Bergamot, mandarin and green notes stand out at the top. As the green notes settle down, a sparkling and sweet lemon note comes through. The fragrance then turns floral as the sweet lemon note takes a back seat and the white flowers come through. I smell the freesia and the lily of the valley. The fragrance stays that way for a couple of hours before the base comes through. The base is soft musky, woody and powdery. Very light and comforting. The fragrance has a great silage and stays on my skin for four hours or so.

CK One is a unisex fragrance which can be pulled off by men and women of any age group. I love wearing CK One when it is a casual day at work or on easy going weekends in spring summer when I am spending time out doors."

It always seemed to be present and a breath of fresh air. It is a bouncy, soft and clean citrus composition reminiscent of cloud nine. It had no gender I designated to it, then and now. CK One, being a perfect unisex fragrance, stands precisely in the middle where the two sexes harmoniously meet."

I find the citrus smell overpowers everything and feels like a punch in the nose. Instead of a complex fragrance all I get is a citrus sensation that is painful, like a sniff of ammonia.
In the 90s my university campus was a thick cloud of CK One in the heat of summer and I held my breath whenever someone wearing CK jeans walked past."

I have to smell my shirt to remember it's there rather fast. My wife pointed it out and I started noticing it really smells like Irish Spring. Definitely lemony too.

Buy Again? If it's really really cheap - Like 10 bucks I might. I would have to impulse buy it at a store though.

CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","This, overall, is fresh and clean with some bit of spiciness. Every time I have it on, I feel like I just stepped out of a shower (where I used a lemon-cardamom based shower gel), then put on freshly washed and conditioned clothes. Quite refreshing especially on a hot day. Plus, there's something timeless about this fragrance, like it will never run out of style. I must say, I quite enjoy CK One!

The opening is heavy on the citruses. I mostly get lemon and bergamot, and a ""juicy sweetness"" from the pineapple, though I am sure mandarin is somewhere in the mix as well. It's also a little green and bitter in the background. Quite interesting, but I am sure I could get other scents that would give me a similar effect (Shiseido Zen, I am looking at you).

The development is where things get interesting. I still get the strong citrus vibe, but the fragrance starts getting woody from the cedar and ""fresher"" from the LOTV. The cardamom and nutmeg are quite present here as well, and they do a good job of surrounding all that freshness with a kick of spice. Fantastic stuff.

As it dries down, believe it or not, I also get some bit of powder, I am guessing from the violet, which somehow manages to work so well with the citruses and the fresh floral. The LOTV comes out so well here as well! CK One then turns into this beautiful, fresh floral, with some spice and powder in the background. I also get a little bit of musk and oak moss, but only if I move around.

Now I understand why this had (and still has) such a mass following. Definitely unisex, but I think its the right balance: not too masculine, not too feminine. I'd say it's some good juice to start with for anyone just starting to explore unisex fragrances.

Projection is about arms length, and it lasts quite a bit (about 6-7 hours on me). I'd say this is suitable for hot weather, but it could also work well for rainy spring type weather.

Definitely getting a full bottle once I am done with my current sample."

This is an episode of My So Called Life in a bottle. Flannel shirts, Jansport backpacks, a hot late afternoon watching Ricki Lake before your parents get home from work. CK One in one word would be 'soft', and I don't mean that in regards to its silage. It's a woody muted floral that isn't sweet, isn't juicy despite all the citrus, and never screeches or beams even if its a textbook clean perfume. Just a pleasant and cheap summer fresher upper with that subtle trademark laundry vibe that stole the show in the 90's. Is it dated? Yeah, a bit. The previous tenant left this in my recent apartment and it was fun to re discover, but I doubt it'll be getting much usage despite being pleasant. Nostalgia is so bittersweet."

This has that powdery/makeup vibe you want from a female scent but yet has the acquatic/woody pine you want from a male scent! I’d say this Leand maybe 25% more to the men’s side. It smells like the 90s can’t go wrong. It’s a summer scent I like it.

Although there are many comments on the dated nature of CK 1, I have no nostalgia for it and I get comments wearing it too. Maybe not so popular in good old Adelaide as in other places at the time.

I received a bottle of this in 1998, 6th grade, but rarely used it.

In 2001, a girl I took to a freshman high school dance wore CK One. By the end of the night, I was covered in this. I fell in love. She broke my heart. For the next two weeks, this scent was stuck in my head. All day, everyday I thought about her and had this scent stuck in my head.

When I want to relax and be at peace with the world, I will dab a little from my 1998 bottle on my wrist before I go to sleep.

CK One Calvin Klein (unisex) ~ 1994,"['citrus', 'green', 'woody', 'powdery', 'aromatic', 'fresh', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'musky', 'floral']","CK ONE is one of those fragrances that smells very different to me depending on the weather. It’s just the thing for a hot, sticky summer day as it’s very refreshing and has the right balance of sharp citrus and softer woody/floral/spicy notes. It isn’t sweet, there’s no vanilla and the citrus is the only fruity note that I can smell. (There’s pineapple in the notes, but it isn’t evident on me.) This is a versatile fragrance and can be dressed up or down, but I tend to wear it primarily as a casual day scent. I find the sillage to be pretty soft and I can apply very liberally without worrying about fumigating the room. Overall longevity is good, but on me it’s so soft that I sometimes like to reapply during the day for a nice citrus burst.

On the other hand, if it’s a chilly day, CK ONE smells like straight-up lemon juice on me for the first hour or so. Once it dries down, I get the well-blended scent that I like and the rest of the progression is the same as it is in hot weather. Also, I prefer stronger fragrances in cool/cold weather and this fragrance is rather too soft for me when the temperatures are lower. So, now that we’re finally getting autumn weather around here, CK ONE goes to the back of the shelf until next summer.

Very fresh and limonose opening. The pineapple along with citrus fruit is something unique and reminds me very much of Chrome by Azzaro. Note green and fresh, then something floral. I do not think I did. Sore point: If you have an acidic PH you have to do 5 separate splashes to make it last for at least 4 hours. The scent of youth!"

Green/musky/floral with a noticeable oakmoss note in the base. Has been already smelt elsewhere since it was issued, but 20 years ago, it was a real revolution.

Easy casual for hotter days. You get a simple but solid fragrance, and you can't go wrong. I'd choose this one or Azzaro Chrome over Acqua di Gio' any day. (noting that CK One and Chrome retail for ~$20, while AdG retails for $50/60.... just nonsense).

Spring/summer days, 15-35, unisex leaning a bit feminine."

I prefere nonoverwhelming fragrances, because they are just perfect, people when come in with a ultra smelly fragrance, it’s just horrible.
Not perfect for date, this is more for a chill plan, but you want to smell incredible. Use this fragrance specially when I don’t know what to wear, or when it’s a super chill plan that I don’t need a strong fragrance.
If you are looking for a more elegant fragrace, try acqua di Gio if you want not a overpowering fragrance. For dates, D&G the one, CH privé, or playboy new york (Montblanc Legend - A&F Fierce Imitation) that will cost you like 14 dollars"

However, with CK One;
I find the top notes quite offensive as to me they smell so synthetic and over-powering and additionally the sillage of these top notes must be a good half hour or even an hour. A nightmare start to my day during my commute is that some guy has liberally sprayed himself with this and the harsh, green, aquatic top notes absolutely fill the carriage. It's really offensive and that the individual clearly thinks it's a good thing just makes it worse; and not just CK One either - Thierry Mugler's Womanty has the same aquatic harsh overpowering effect. Luckily this has been discontinued - unluckily a woman in the office is wearing it right now :( may it slip from her hand the next time she applies it in her bathroom.

I was expecting something more badass, more smokey, more masculine... and instead got a pleasantly sweet Christmas spice. I liked it though and still do! I expected it to be less sweet and the tobacco to be smokier, but it's actually the smell of damp tobacco. At first spray you are greeted with spices that you might find in mulled wine.(hence the holiday feel) Dried fruits sprinkled with Nesquick coco powder add a nice touch, and all these accords are nicely rounded, supported by a vanillic base.
I am curious to try an earlier formulation, since I have read it used to be less sweet and more potent. But this one is quite pleasant. Just not something that blew me away. Maybe my expectations were a bit too high."

Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","I tried the 2020 Batch.
How long did it last? - OKish, moderate. On my skin it lasted for a good 2-3 hours and then became a skin scent. 5 hours later I can barely smell it which was quite surprising as I considered this a heavy scent.
How does it smell? - The first few mins were very strong, & just reminded me of wet tobacco smell, not in a good way... after the first 20 odd mins, the vanilla started to emerge and the smell started to grow on me. The dry down was a mix of mild tobacco, vanilla & spice...but very faint. I am 35 but I feel this is more suitable for 50+
Overall verdict - It is something you can buy if you are trying to add versatility to your frag collection but this is a pass for me. If it lasted strong & the mid/base notes had more character then 'maybe'. But as is, I would prefer the Tobacco oud over this one (even though that doesn't have my fav. vanilla, the oud shines in that one while the tobacco is bearable). Also Tobacco oud’s performance on my skin is monstrous... I could smell it 12 hrs later.
I would recommend checking out ‘Vanilla Flash Tauerville’ as an alternative for Tobacco Vanille."

After years of purchasing decants, I finally decided to buy a 100ml. It’s100% reformulated to trash. all the sweet notes have been toned down. All I’m getting it’s a dusty tobacco, lots of dry spices and the tobacco blossom note is quite prominent now.
This batch should just named Tobacco Épices. But some may love it."
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","First spray on paper: Chai tea latte! Sweet, warm and delicious-- but basic. The initial spray was mouth-watering, but it was too reminiscent of a seasonal candle. The vanilla and the spices (cinnamon, clove, etc.) were immediately present. If you don't like gourmand scents, stay far away. The initial spray on paper made me think this scent lacked complexity and elevation. The dry-down on skin proved me wrong. The longer you smell it, the more it changes.

On my skin: A distinct powderiness comes forward as it dries down-- tobacco blossom, perhaps? The notes of dried fruit (definitely some sort of berries) and cocoa are very prominent when sprayed on my skin, and they combine to create a boozy, almost medicinal, accord reminiscent of rum or even holiday fruit cake. The tobacco is elevated and ephemeral. If I put my nose directly to my skin, I won't get the tobacco note. Instead, the tobacco and vanilla notes are intertwined and exist in the sillage, wafting around you.

The powder and berry notes make this distinctly feminine to me. The femininity is tempered slightly by the masculine tobacco aura, but it is nonetheless not the truly unisex scent many characterize it as. Avoid for summer-- the sweetness of the berries, cocoa and vanilla will mix poorly with sweat and natural musk-- but excellent for all other seasons. There's nothing juvenile or simple about this scent. Mature without being grannyish. Sexy, but not too try-hard. Bold notes are muted in a way that keeps this fragrance from being too garish or difficult to wear. The right woman could wear this with jeans and tee, but it's probably best reserved for an intimate night-time occasion.

High-quality bottle, even with respect to the travel size. The travel size has a magnetic cap with a nice atomizer."

Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","It's quite clear upon first sniff that you are dealing with a special fragrance made from high quality ingredients. First and foremost I smell a deliciously festive and spicy combination of cloves and cinnamon (notes which persist throughout the mid and deep dry down). Next, an earthy, sweet tobacco note begins to peek through. It is warm, sweet, and comforting, made zesty and uplifting by the spices. The vanilla in this is smooth and woody. The longer it sits on the skin, the sweeter it becomes but the sweetness here is not artificial, it is perfectly balanced and downright joyful. Be warned, however - if you are not a fan of spicy (as in spices) fragrances, this might not be the one for you. I feel like Tobacco Vanille would have been more aptly named if ""Clove"" or ""Spice"" were included somewhere in the name."

I can’t speak to the current formulations but I have an older bottle and it lasts for 8-10 hours easily. TF TV is rich and spicy and exudes quality. It scratches an itch for me that nothing like it does. But I could see someone not liking the spices in this. The tobacco and vanilla are lovely but the cinnamon/clove/nutmeg accord is anything but subtle in the early stages. This is not for people who can’t tolerate intense spices.

I really enjoy this scent but was quite surprised by the performance after reading reviews of it being almost to strong.

I was expecting similar sillage, as for instance spicebomb extreme, which is one of my favorite scents.

TV turns into a skin scent for me rather quickly. Spraying on clothes doesn’t really seem to make a difference. It does last long but I wish it would project more.

Definitely not what I was expecting. Does anyone else have a similar experience?"
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","Tobacco Vanille.

I've got a lot to say about this one.

I'll start with three words (if I had to choose only three): Sweet, Sensual, Sophisticated. I have to say though, after developing a close relationship with this delicious beast, I think Mr. Ford got the name reversed; it should've been named 'Vanille et Tabac'; the vanilla note is commander-in-chief here. The tobacco is in there, but it's closer to the sweetness and mildness of a Danish tobacco than to the pungent and perfume-like aroma of Oriental tobacco, and it never gets a chance to truly shine, sadly. The vanilla always has the upper hand all the way through drydown. And it may just be my nose, but in the middle of it all I get the impression of a slight Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookie note. Does that make it bad? Certainly not, unless you can't stand really sweet scents, in which case I would tell you to stay far away from this one. If a more incense-like, Oriental tobacco presence is more your thing, I would direct you to Mancera Red Tobacco as my favorite alternative, but I digress...

I am a tobacco note fanatic, it is my favorite aroma in perfumes. So far I've acquired about fifteen fragrances with tobacco either in their names, and/or as a major note, and out of all them, Tobacco Vanille takes the prize with regards to:

- Overall quality of ingredients (debatable, certainly, but I'm saying they are well above average when I compare it to the similar ones in my collection)
- Steadfast longevity (this juice will last at least 12 hours on the skin, and around a week on a shirt if you don't wash it),
- Aroma strength / scent bubble (you'll get at least a six-foot radius)
- Having the most consistent, linear lifespan (its character remains virtually the same from fresh out of the bottle to barely a whisper behind the ear)
- Being the absolute Sweetest Beast Mode fragrance of the bunch!

Incidentally, if I were to compare Tobacco Vanille's outstanding qualities to those of an automobile, it would be a Porsche 911 Turbo S.

All of the above qualities combined make it worth every penny of the high price it fetches, when you consider that a bottle will probably last you several years if you use it mostly for special occasions and you only spray it once per application, and trust me, you don't need to spray it any more than that, especially indoors; this juice has enough strungth to fill a large room with its aroma from just two sprays, so I offer a friendly recommendation/warning to go easy on this stuff. It's an amazing delight for the senses when used very sparingly, but it can quickly become a sickeningly sweet, cloying, obnoxious, migraine-inducing nightmare if it's overdone. If you must spray it twice, please, do it outside, and walk into it from a couple of feet back, that will do you just fine for the entire day.

It is a straight up unisex scent, and I think it would be an awesome fragrance for the 25+ year old ladies and gentlemen to wear to a fancy dress do or wedding or outdoor party, but I would not wear this in the club; it's too nice of a fragrance, too luxurious, too expensive, and to me it demands a degree of discretion, but that's only my impression; you may get great results on the dancefloor, but for that setting, and for the price, I believe JPG Ultra Male, YSL 'Y' EdP, or Armani Code Profumo would be better sweetness contenders, but again, I digress...

I find it odd to find myself saying this, given that I feel like it's too good for the club, but in a casual situation, like running errands around town, this would be a fun one to put on just to get strangers to turn their heads...but careful, you just might end up with a line of them following behind you ;) If worn right, this fragrance has an awesome Wow factor, and it can be a great compliment-getter! And if you do decide to go casual with it...I'm no fashion guru, but don't wear this with just jeans and a t-shirt; this deserves at least the addition of a sport coat and some comfortable leather dress shoes to complete the outfit.

I wouldn't wear this to work. It seems too sweet and distracting and intense for a work environment, at least an indoor one.

Also, I would not put this on if I were going somewhere to eat. People may disagree with me, but this is a gourmand more than just an aromatic, due to the heavy vanilla, and gourmands distract me from my meal. I can't eat a savory main course and have a persistent aroma of a sugary dessert right under my nose the whole time, no thank you!

Finally, if you're looking for a great introduction to Tom Ford's fragrance lines, I'd say, with the exceptions of Oud Wood and Ombre Leather (personal preferences), you don't need to look any further.

My verdict: Overall 9 out of 10. Very, very nice if used with restraint. This fragrance really rides that fine line between sublime and repulsive; all it takes is one spray too many to tip that scale toward the latter. An excellent value despite the high cost; I think you really do get what you pay for here. It loses a point for being just a bit too sweet an aroma overall, and not having the tobacco note more prominent in the mix, but otherwise it's Excellent.

I highly recommend that everyone at least gives Tobacco Vanille a sniff once in their life, if the chance comes along, and if you're interested in buying some, then I think it is imperative that you do sample it first. If you're a big fan of the main notes already, then this could be a very tempting blind buy. I think it is a wonderful treat for the senses, and if you have that wish list of fragrances you have to save up for, then this could be a very worthy addition to it."

My girl friend didn't like it, she said it smells like an Xmas Yankee candle and I sadly agree.

It's STRONG and spillage is big but it took atleast 2 hours before it started to settle into a different smell, it loses some of the cinnamon and turns into the tobacco scent, I get zero vanilla and zero sweetness from this. Please please don't blind buy this it will save you a lot of money."

It felt like I have smelled this long time ago but couldn't put my finger on what it was. Since then this fragrance became an instant love for me! Great and refined better than niche quality imho! 10/10 with awesome performance. Great job Tom Ford."
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","I succumbed to the hype. I bought a sizeable decant of this one. I'm not blind buying a 300 bone fragrance, as much as I think this would be fine in that instance. If you have the extra cash, you like tobacco and cinnamon based scents, well you may have a winner here. Can't comment on presentation or what have you... I'm sure it's good. It's Tom Ford.

So, the scent. Absolutely tobacco and spices... Mostly cinnamon but it's a melange of spices. A little sweetness from the vanilla and cacao. I think this is a case where it smells designer and the price tag doesn't justify what you get. Being brutally honest. It is a great scent. It lasts, too.... Is it worth the price tag though? I would say no. Starts with a nice blast of tobacco and spices, dries down to faint tobac and cinnamon. That's what you're getting. Maybe a little spiciness from cardamom (which isn't listed) but that's it. It's extremely basic. I feel like you could get something similar at a fraction of the cost.

Situationally? Formal. It does smell high end and masculine. If you want a black tie scent, here you go. Otherwise, you could skip it and find something similar for much less.. As far as scent alone, it is a magnificent marriage between tobacco and spices. I am weary of the cost/benefit ratio, though."
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","In my personal opinion this is one of the best private blends Tom Ford does.

I love when a perfume ""takes you somewhere"", and Tobacco Vanille takes me to a gentleman's sitting room, with dark rosewood furniture, cigars and scotch being poured from decanters.

The masculine vibes of tobacco and cognac and wood are balanced well with the vanilla. Sometimes vanilla can be very overpowering and make a perfume too sweet and feminine, however the way it is done here makes the perfume truly unisex. This would smell equally expensive and sexy on both men and women."

I have tried a couple batches and I like the smokier for sure. The spices can get Chrismassy in a Santa non-f--kable way, which is sad. So keep it smoky, please Tom!

I am late to the party as usual on all things, and I actually first explored this just after Valentine's Day (2021) on vacation on Jekyll Island in GA. Our awesome fragrance guy at Nordstrom (near Philly) gave me great samples of TF and PdM, and I just was crazy for TF TV!

Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","I can’t tell you how much a I adore this perfume.

It starts off with a dark, sexy and intoxicating blast of Vanilla and Tobacco. Think Cigars and a dark, twisted version of Vanilla which is the result of Tobacco, Vanilla and fruity notes giving it a slightly boozy, Whiskey like facade.

The spices give it a moody edge, almost like the yellow light from the lamps inside a gentlemen’s club and their contrast from the mahogany covered walls and dark leather chairs.

The dry down is a very beautiful vanilla-woody-spicy slightly fruity affair which makes it even more addictive."
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","Have I anything to say that hasn't been said ?

This fragrance is exquisitely simple, and beautifully well balanced. The name depicts exactly what you will get greeted with: A pouring of thick vanilla cream over a freshly opened box of cigarets. It's a perfect balance of tobacco, vanilla, and some spices accompanying the fragrance from beginning to end very interestingly.

Tobacco lovers, or not. Vanilla fans, or not. I don't really know anyone who does not 'Like' Tobacco Vanille, or at least appreciate it. If it's not at first sniff, maybe the second....or third. This fragrance, imo, screams emotions and feelings. It is warm, deep, mature but playful at the same time.

TF TV is one of a kind, and which possibly launched the sweet-tobacco trend since it's release in 2007. Very suitable in winter and fall, but equally beautiful for spring and humid summer nights - possibly wearing a blue linen shirt, on a rooftop bar, having some cocktails.

For me, this is a 10/10 fragrance for the simplicity, depth, warmth, and emotions it triggers.."

In the store I smelled it and bought it a week later but now after wearing it for a couple hours I don't like the smell. Gives me a headache, soooo much vanilla. Will be giving it to my sister. Smells too dirty for me. However it is VERY VERY VERY strong.. I did 2 sprays on my neck and my room smelled like it when I got home! Long lasting. Just not my taste."

Heads will be turned wearing this perfume. A man wearing this perfume going out with his guy friends, will get the most attention. Everyone will look at him when the ober askes who to give the bill to.
A Woman wearing this perfume just screams “ I’m independent, and can take good care of myself “.
Wearing this scent to a normal 9-5 job will have your coworkers think you don’t need this job, and that you got stacks of money. LOL
The notes I pickup are: Spices, Vanilla, Cacao , Tobacco, and a little hint of Fruit wich makes the perfect blend.
I would personally wear this fragrance in the winter time or when I know that I will be in an airconditioned room. It last 8+ hours on my skin.

Although this is the perfect fragrance, it is NOT for the weak !!!

5/5 Star"
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","I don't know what I can say about TV that hasn't already been said. To me, and many others, this is the gold standard for any gourmand, vanilla, tobacco. This is what any fragrance with those main notes or accords will get compared to, and depending on where it lands, will be sweeter or less sweet, smoky or less smoky than TV. And that's just how it is, this is a staple fragrance, and for good reason. No one does it like TF and if you haven't smelled it, do yourself a favour and try a decant or sample. You will not be disappointed.
I also think this is a gold star for being one of the most perfectly unisex fragrances out there. While again, fragrance has no gender, this really is right in the middle. I think anyone could wear this and I would be hard pressed to find anyone who doesn't at least find this perfume to smell nice.

Longevity is excellent, 8-10 hours on my skin, silage is heavy.

Overall 9.5/10, TF knows what he's doing and this is a top seller for a reason."

This smell seriously makes me feel like I’m cruising around Havana, Cuba, in the evening with Fidel Castro as my chauffeur. But like...he just got a vanilla air refresher in a vain attempt to cover up the mustiness that is his 1950’s coupe deville. And there’s a wet dog in the backseat with me. He’s takes a puff of his a cigar and while turning around to apologize for the smoke, he spills a hot chocolate he’s been sipping all over my pants.

That’s what this smells like; like Fidel Castro’s beard."
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","Don't expect this to be a more sweet and easy vanilla, it is definetly tobacco and vanille. The spicy feeling leaves the sweet part leaning more sour, like a strong vanilla liquor drunk alongside a cigar, or maybe catching a whif of a smoker wearing a vanilla perfume. It's not that it is not pleasant, it is, but if you spect somehow for the vanilla to be like a madeleine-type instead of approaching honey territory, skip this. Definetly unisex, I don't think it leans towards any side and with the right attitude, anyone could pull this off. The performance is a roller coaster, it starts so intense it feels headache-inducing but then it drops suddenly and becomes a subtle but pleasant skin scent, even if not as intense, it still holds on fairly well on my skin. Perhaps the intensity drop is for the best, as i feel that overspraying this or a way too strong projection could easily make this perfume annoying, cloying or even offensive for some."

Spicy tobacco with a layer of vanilla bean and undercut by currents of Tonka bean and cacao. This scent is just delicious. I wish I could eat it. This is a very mature scent, I'd say for over 28+.

This is one of those unique unisex perfumes that smells just as good on either sex. I'd wear this for intimate dates because when someone hugs you they don't want to pull away.

There are many clones and interpretations of this that cost much less but they are not Tom Ford's Tobacco Vanille. The quality of this perfume is above reproach. It smells better than you'd expect it to.

The projection is enormous and the sillage is like a cruise ship's wake. This lasted over 30 hours on my skin and twice as long on my clothes.

I recommend everyone into tobacco Scents get a bottle of this. The cost is high but it is worth every single cent for this scent."

Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","I was so disappointed by this.

Let me preface my review with the fact that I LOVE THIS PERFUME. When I smelled it for this first time, I knew that it would be my signature scent. It's gorgeous: a warm, spicy vanilla with a hint of amber. It's sweet without being cloying, spicy without being musky. I could smell it all day. I bought a full-sized bottle for myself, the most expensive purchase I have ever made.

However... sillage on me is literally 0. When I did my research, I found a bunch of users who said that you could absolutely not spray this perfume more than twice without overwhelming a whole city block. This is totally not true in my case. I did 7 (SEVEN!!) sprays, went out with some friends, and not one of them could smell it on me unless they pressed their nose into my skin. Further, the lasting power is only ok (I can still smell it at the end of the day, but only if I also press my nose into my wrist).

I bought my bottle from a department store. It's real. I've stored it in the box, in a cool, dry location. I'm spraying on my pulse points with moisturized skin. There's absolutely no reason why this perfume would be performing badly, outside any issues with skin chemistry.

Anyways, just a word to the wise. Try it before you buy it to see if it projects on you.

I'm wondering if I'm totally crazy, or if anyone else has had this experience with this so-called 'powerhouse' perfume!"

This is hands down the cologne of 2020/2021. I often like to wear two colognes: one for the skin, and one for my outerwear. This cologne is perfect for the skin as it leaves a strong musky yet very sweet smell on the skin, and I love to pair it with Margiela's Jazz club on my clothes (the ladies love it hahah)."

The beautiful cherry tobacco is so wonderfully intense and it’s paired with syrupy dried fruits that resemble a mince pie. There is a dry , powdery cocoa note that encapsulates the main notes in a delicious cloud. In the dry down the vanilla rises and pairs equally with the tobacco for a magical result. These are two of my favourite notes so paired together, it’s an inevitable love. This reminds me of Christmas in New York. It’s perfectly unisex."
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","This perfume gave me the wrong impression at first. I purchased it with my partner because it's unisex and it could work for both of us. at first spritz, it does not feel regular or familiar, so it can be a bit annoying if you're more into soft romantic scents like I am. However, after a couple of hours of wearing this, I noticed it lingered beautifully on me. It's sweet, yet not too girly. It becomes intimate and sexy, but still not in a slutty way. Even my manager who's usually so strict and never comments on anything walked into the office and the first thing he did was asking where this beautiful scent was coming from. I gotta say... I really like this one!"

Sweet, cozy, warm & opulent.
'Spicy' is the term used for a food that brings tears, burns living tissues in the mouth & literally springs a river through the nose... and ofcourse the steam jetting out of one's ears! ;)
TV doesn't do any such thing, it caresses the most vivid olfactory spots of an individual with some dark satin gloves. Rich, sophisticated and transcendental.

Again, TV has sweet comforting Spices,
and no it isn't 'SPICY'!

The smell blew me away. This is a simply gorgeous vanilla with a divine smoky dry down, not too sweet, totally unisex and utterly delicious. My criticism is that the lasting power is a joke. Its utterly pathetic for the price of this juice. I get 30 minutes and then it disappears into a skin scent. Much as this is beautiful, I couldn't justify a full bottle."

The tobacco is very inoffensive, it is light, it is sweet, it is somewhat feminine. I have no issue with this as I believe all fragrances are truly unisex, but for a western nose it may be slightly feminine.

I also pick up something somewhat nutty in the background, very subtle but there.. reminds me of a creamy macadamia nut (again this is very subtle!) The key players here are sweet vanilla, gentle sweet tobacco, tied together with some Christmas spices, dried fruits and dark chocolate."

The reformulated version is a sparse thin veil of its former self. Unless you have money to burn, buy Al Haramain’s Amber Oud Tobacco Edition (which has no Oud despite the name). It’s five times the strength at one seventh the cost! I’ve found Al Haramain fragrances to be powerful, economical, and their customer service is superb.

Now many fragrances, even designer's ones, followed this path of oriental gourmand. I still remember my first spray and I was mesmerised. A dry bitter vanilla that confused my senses. It was like nothing smelled before. It does not remind me of something, but it takes away my conscience to a new mysterious world. I would lose my mind to sniff that on a man, but unfortunately never happened. A masterpiece that cannot be missed in collectors' cabinets. 3.5/5"

This fragrance smells of vanilla, dried fruits, cacao, spicy notes, tobacco blossom, and a weird lotion play-doh note. I was expecting a strong more masculine tobacco, but all I get is a very light feminine tobacco blossom note.

This fragrance is extremely unisex and far more feminine leaning. I personally would not recommend this for a man, and even I am a big fan of unisex and even feminine fragrances for me, this just does not work.

This smells weirdly similar to Lancôme Hypnose, but in all honesty I really prefer hypnose to this."

The accidental notes sometimes are really funny when you open your eyes surprised that the perfume smells like something you know would never end up being used in perfumery.

Unfortunately with this scent that note to me was corned beef and I can't shake it off.

It's not something you know, but something you feel so how can one cheat oneself that it's not true and it's silly?
It's a shame as I really wanted to like this one!

I guess I'm going to blame my mum for buying very posh corned beef when I was little.

Tobacco vanille almost has a lotion-y aspect to it, that reminds me of Lush's vanilla scents, and Snowcake (their wintry marzipan soap). This fragrance smells like real vanilla, bean pod and all. On me the tobacco is light, the leather is present, and I think the wood and fruit come forward more. It's nice but is not my favorite TF fragrance.

Boom! Sweet liquorice/clove on the open, softens quickly through natural leather into addictive pipe tobacco. The Vanilla is clever, it never 'swells', it's always there providing an underlying sweetness, linking everything together. Very clever indeed.

Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","[FEB.2021]
One of the best sweet fragrances of all time and quite possibly the best crowd-pleasing ""starter"" luxury perfume (as Tobacco Vanille Body Spray) of the early 2020s(!)

It is as addictive to my nose now as it was then. This was my perfume, since 2017, that started it all for me and got me hooked into the world of perfumery.

Buying the perfume for $115 (Australian Dollars) as a body spray this gives you a performance beyond what half the other fragrances around the $200+ range can achieve in projection and sniffability when it comes to being able to smell your own scent. In fact, you don't have to worry about not smelling this on yourself if you buy the body spray, whatsoever.

If you can smell it with a <1 second spritz, you can bet others will wonder what that delicious salted caramellised dried fruit-chewing tobacco smoke-vanilla rum smell is and that is unmistakeably the realm of Tobacco Vanille.

If you have this now and want more: get ready for the ""gourmands"" of the Niche Fragrance big league and reach for Guerlain's Spiriteuse Double Vanille / Gourmande Coequin(?) , Crivelli's Iris Malikhan, Amouage's Crimson Rocks, April Aromatics' Calling All Angels, Nasomatto's Pardon, Lubin's Gajah Mada, Santa Maria Novella's Vaniglia, and Carner's Palo Santo.

And if I were more into heavy spice laden, rich tobacco smells I could easily see how this is probably the best one out there. Unfortunately it's just too much of everything it contains. It's tobacco, spices, real vanilla (think vanilla paste) to the extreme, so thick and dense that it's almost suffocating. On my skin, this veers too far into masculine territory for my comfort. Now I can handle the male sporty citruses, the barber-shop lavenders, but pipe tobacco will always remind me of my father, a man's man who wore Old Spice and was constantly covered in sawdust from the cabinetry he worked around all day. I just can't seem to pull it off, but I know many women who do. This might be for them, but it's just not for me. And it's such a beautiful scent, it almost pains me to let it go because there's a part of me that wants to keep it around, hoping that maybe with time and age, I'll be able to get over those hang ups and wear this scent the way I know it can be worn by a beautiful, powerful, and even seductive woman. But I just can't, and keeping it and holding onto it but never wearing it would be doing this wonderful artistry of perfume a disservice.

I don't know when or why they did this unjustice to this beast of a perfume but I don't want to own it, so I'm getting rid of mine. I will wait for an old(er) batch or maybe for TF house to change something and make it amazing again. If you'll buy it now, have in mind it's nothing more than cinnamon and a hint of watery vanilla.

Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","One of the best things I have ever smelled. If you love vanilla and tobacco in your fragrances this will probably be in your top 3, but since it's sooo expensive I recommend getting a decant/sample before you buy a whole thing. Also if you want a cheaper more feminine version MAC Velvet Teddy smells like 90% similar, the vanilla is less rich, it has a bit of honey, and doesn't last quite as long but it is a fraction of the cost.

Interestingly pulls a little more smoky on me, and a little more sweet on my bf. Nonetheless I'd still say it's unisex and I think it smells amazing on both of us."

Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","First blast of vanilla root beer, warm cozy sweet, becoming more dark and smokey as it dries down. It's a rich round sweet pipe tobacco rather than a tangy cigarette tobacco. The potency fades pretty fast on my skin but at least projection radiates a bit and doesn't sit super close. I would expect the strength to maintain some of its levels at $300/50 mL but that wasn't the case.

Unisex but leans a tad masculine and perfect for cold weather nights.

6+ hours later: still there, going moderately strong."
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","When I bought a dab-on sample from lucky sent it smelled straight up like a chocolate milkshake so wasn’t too keen on it for a year or so. Then after that I transferred the perfume to a spray bottle and when I sprayed, it bloomed gorgeously and stayed that way for ages too! The prominent cinnamon clove spice blend at the top followed by the tobacco, woods and tonka in the middle and a lactonic, milky vanilla with chocolate at the base was well blended and not tacky at all. I guess you need to spray to really enjoy. Although similar and cheaper perfumes do exist out there, the sillage, longevity, balance of notes, and consistency of scent is why it’s so expensive in the first place. Great for fall, winter, nighttime or cool weather...not so much for humid climate regions or summer. This is totally unisex as well!! The tobacco clove combo gives it a prominent masculine edge while the cinnamon and the undertone of vanilla gives it a sweet edge that allows women to wear it and still feel distinctly feminine. If wearing to the office I suggest spraying like a day before on your clothes as this scent is a beast."
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","Oh my! This is where you cross over that price point and it REALLY pays off.

A luxurious spicy gourmand, with the perfect balance of vanilla, spice and tobacco. The tobacco notes are quite bright and fresh, so you don't have to worry about that 'stale' ashy smell that can sometimes accompany poorer quality tobacco scents.

To me, this smells really quite sexual, but understated. Pure class in a bottle. My OH says this smells like dark spicy chocolate to him, but for me it's the vanilla, tobacco, spice and tonka bean that shines through.

It is simultaneously feminine and masculine. Gender bending, if you will, which is part of what makes this fragrance so sexy. The next time I use this, I will do so wearing chinos, brogues and a tight-fitting rollneck. This is like spraying on confidence! The best sample I have ever purchased. I will be grabbing a full bottle next payday, even if it means I have to eat baked beans for the next month.

UPDATE: More than 24 hours later, I can still smell this on my jacket. Absolute winner!"

I don't think I will be able to wear it regularly enough to part ways with $200 for it but I'll try the Alexandria dupe or the generic scents dupe

Edit: Generic Scents dupe was a total failure, stinky tobacco not the smooth creamy tobacco found here. I'll try oil perfume's dupe next."
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","Very comforting for a warm winter scent. The tobacco note leans it to the ""more masculine"" side of unisex for me.

As @JJohans1 mentioned, there was a strange medicinal honey cough drop thing going on at first that I didn't like, but I figured that I should let it dry down and give it a chance before I scrub it off. I'm glad I waited, because the vanilla smells like legitimate vanilla bean paste mixed with an old timey pipe tobacco. Very cozy sweater scent and it's a strong ""like"" from me, but I don't ""love"" it enough to pay what they're currently asking.

So far out of all the Tom Ford scents that I've tried, Tuscan Leather is the only one that I'm willing to part with $200+ in order to obtain a mere 50 mL."

I read a review that said if aliens came to earth and needed one fragrance for reference, this would be it.
I used this as my signature cold weather fragrance for several years and it brings back a rush of good memories.

I wore this on nights out with friends and spur of the moment trips to Vegas with the boys.
I wore this to work when I was delivering big presentations for a confidence boost.
I wore this on the first date with my wife.

I recommend this to all my friends and colleagues when I'm asked for a recommendation.
It's expensive but 100% worth it IMO.

Everyone should try and get their noses on this at some point in their lives. It is truly special."

The one that consistently breaks into all top 10 rankings on blogs, websites and forums.

You might think that due to how rich it is, it lacks versatility...but no. That's why i called it ""gentle"", because no matter how potent and rich it may present itself on the skin, there's a certain non-intrusive unique tenderness in the vanilla drydown unlike any vanilla i smelled, which makes it wearable any time, any year, any month.

This is her favourite smell, I like it a lot too. If you want a longer lasting, stronger but cheaper replica, Al Haramain's Amber Oud (just make sure it's the right one, apparently there are two of the same name with a different smell).

I still prefer TF Tobacco Oud from the Private Blend but Tobacco Vanille is definitely the silver medal winner for me in that collection.

Super powdery sweet on my skin - too much so for my taste - and that is what is projecting. There is a bit of leather and vanilla underneath but it's hard for me to detect after having it on for about two hours. Something about my skin tends to accentuate powdery and sweet notes. I may like the smell in the morning, but probably not worth suffering the first few hours to get to it. I may ask my OH to give it a whirl if he's game. It may be more suited to his skin.

Projection is maximum 200km, I’ve got a friend in Japan and he only got a faint whiff in the air.

Phenomenal fragrance!"
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","Tobacco Vanille clearly splits opinion and perception, likely because it seems to be extremely sensitive to body chemistry. Even on myself, there are noticeable differences day to day. Most of the time the little variances are lovely, but occasionally it’s a bit ashy —  not unlike my experience with Tea for Two.

I very, very much recommend trying this more than once, whether you love it or hate it on the first try. See if it changes. This is not a blind buy.

For me, in a word: perfection.

On my skin, most of the time it’s tobacco from the top. A lovely, warm pipe tobacco. The vanilla is there — or more accurately, it’s like the crispness of vanilla sugar — as is the sweetness of dried fruit and tonka, but on me those are secondary until the heart starts to come through and the tobacco blends a little more with the vanilla. The dry-down lasts forever, through showering and sleep, a lovely, warm, sweet skin scent still there in the morning. For me, it’s never been cloying.

I definitely reach for this more in the cold seasons, but it’s not entirely out of place in the summer either. Very much unisex — I think it’s more the chemistry that determines for whom it works than any notion of femininity or masculinity.

My closest comparison will be my other favorite, Tauer’s Vanilla Flash. I’ve seen differing opinions on this too, but for me VF is maybe a little more complex, a little more nuanced, a little more spicy — perhaps from the signature rose in there. But the straightforwardness of Tobacco Vanille is a feature when the blend is just so right.

Over where I live, people are pretty restrained. But Tobacco Vanille seems to be something that melts even that reticence and elicits compliments. That, for me, is high praise.

I noticed a review saying “four spritzes is enough”, and frankly that frightened me! To me, using that much either says that it’s a faulty bottle, or a very desensitized nose. Just a single spritz on the wrist or neck will last me an entire day with maybe a refresh if I want more of the top and heart than the dry-down for the evening. Sillage is just about perfect after the initial blast of about 30 minutes — I try to avoid being in confined places before that, because it can be overpowering to people. After that, though, it’s easily noticeable from a couple meters away without (I think) being offensively strong.

As is the case with all the Private Blends, Tobacco Vanille is overpriced. Not because the quality isn’t there, but because the price is simply too high for any scent. And that said, I have and will spend too much on it because I love it."

It's warm and cozy, has a gentle vanilla scent, and is a teeny, tiny bit gourmand. While it's slightly sweet, this is no typical Willie Wonka perfume, like we're seeing EVERYWHERE.

Bonus - if you mix it with Tom Ford's Bitter Peach, it'll add a bit of something special and you'll be extra happy!

Also, buy the body spray. It's $75, (in contrast to the couple hundred the perfume costs) and the staying power is fabulous!"
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","Tobacco Vanille is phenomenal... if you smell it once in a while. It’s a sweet spicy fruity gourmand perfume and wearing it becomes a struggle after a couple of hours - for me.

Yes, you can smell the tobacco leaf amidst the blend, but it’s mainly a spicy (clove and cinnamon) vanilla combo.

There’s a popular dessert here in Brasil called “pão de mel” (“honey bread” in a literal translation). And, being totally simplistic, that’s what Tobacco Vanille is to me: the scent of “pão de mel”. So much so that I can’t even go further in any “note breakdown analysis”.

I hope, from the bottom of my heart, that my opinion about it would change, because,
otherwise, I’m stuck with a 100ml bottle of a perfume that I haven’t really learned how to appreciate (imagine the buyer’s remorse of being hooked by the hype - once again - I’m going through right now... when will I learn?)"

I did not know I needed it until I had it. This is AMAZING! I wasn't convinced I'd like it because of the tobacco, but it's rich, thick, smokey vanilla with hints of cherry in the background. Those who mentioned Michael's around Christmas time, yasss! That scent, elevated!

It also reminded me of sitting in a lounge in an upscale Caribbean resort, wearing a vanilla scent, sipping on a fruity drink, while a couple people are smoking cigars somewhere around."
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","The story begins with the first spray of perfume where there is a quarrel between the soft vanilla and the masculine tonka bean amid intense pressure from the tobacco note to break the quarrel. This opening is the reason many people hate this fragrance. The softness of vanilla and the masculinity of the tonka bean is a contradiction; This is not the shouting of tobacco loudly to calm the situation (as opposed to the hallway and the sobriety known to the cigar owners). No wonder there are people who did not understand or hate this beginning. After this debate comes a sharp note of spice, calming the situation and changing the course of the situation from quarrels to the utmost intimacy. So vanilla reveals its beauty and appears in its most beautiful guise. Tonka bounces comfort and spreads its charm and elegance. Amid confident laughs of tobacco indicating that the situation is stable. After the reconciliation and the clarity of the atmosphere, the tobacco note relaxes, lights her cigars and orders a cocoa cake with three hot chocolate delivery from one of the upscale cafes. And to the honesty, this is what happens in this perfume, a quarrel, a reconciliation, a wrapping it, and a peace of mind that accompanies the smell of cocoa. Tobacco Vanille perfume is a masterpiece and one of the finest Tom Ford perfumes. And the most complex of them and distinguished with (Tuscan Leather of course). Truth be told, you don't find perfume on the market right now. Show tobacco like this. I also pay tribute to the delicate sense of Tom Ford, where the vanilla in this fragrance was most beautifully presented, in the manner of the distinguished perfumer Jean Paul Gerlan. This fragrance is night and winter first class. With a fairly masculine degree. Stability: Extra Strength. One of the most stable perfumes. The persistence of this fragrance makes its high value it deserves. Al-Fouhan: high permeability and striking force for five hours at worst."

I hesitated on getting a decant of this because the tobacco in the name and as a note really did not appeal to me. Reading reviews saying it smells like cigarettes also made me unsure if I should try it out. But I did. This doesn't smell like cigarettes on me at all thankfully. It smells like a chai tea latte, which others have mentioned below. It's funny because I sprayed this and immediately the spice came through so, so strong. It wasn't unappealing, but if you are spice averse in your fragrances, you might hate this upon the first spray. But the vanilla comes in and transforms the spice into a creamy, complex chai. Strong projection, still testing longevity. Really enjoyable."

My husband brought this to me as a sample on a tester paper the other morning and I carried it around all day smelling it.

Today I went to the mall and decided to try it on my person to see if the chemistry works well with me, YES it does. She sprayed me up all the way (talking around 10 sprays, which I'm now aware is a lot for this to most people, but it was perfect for me). The lasting power is good. It stayed with my all day, though it has weakened a lot now that it's been about 12h later. The best part was I could smell it on myself as I moved throughout the day, even hours later, without being overwhelmed. It's just a breath of ""yum"". The store worker thought it was a bit daring for me to wear it on it's own, being a woman in my 20's. She said she usually mixes it with something more feminine so it's not so masculine but I would not mess with perfection. Though I've read reviews of women saying it leans more masculine and men saying it leans more feminine, I personally think it's exactly unisex. Tom Ford knew what he was doing when he labeled it exactly that, Unisex. Because this masterpiece does not belong to a single gender, ANYONE would smell fantastic in this. Sharing is caring!

To me it's sweet and tobacco, it's amazing, it's love. If my inner-world had a scent it would be this. It's so cozy and beautiful, sexy and warm. When I have it on I feel like I'm weightless, floating on my own cloud of bliss. It's my heart's home and it speaks comfort to my senses.

I didn't know of all the hype around Tom Ford scents or Tobacco Vanille before I first smelled it, but learning of it now, i get it. It's honestly quite pricey for me and I likely would have never had a second thought to try it if my husband didn't decide to put it on a tester strip randomly for me to smell. I am eternally grateful for the introduction to this scent. Now that I've smelled it, it's my mission in life to have a bottle in my possession at all times. xD

My daughter smelled it and loved it. She wore before I did, and it was different on her. The spices and vanilla sweetness came right out.

Then, I wore it, and same.

It is a great fragrance, I gave her the bottle as I don’t like how it sits on my skin. Don’t shy away from it, my suggestion is that it’s not a blind buy fragrance, and don’t rely on a tester strip. Get it on your skin and test it out first."

On my skin, I get a beautifully spicy vanilla opening that dries down into a gorgeous vanilla pipe tobacco with hints of a complex cocoa/dark chocolate and ever-so-subtle fruitiness that I can't quite put my nose on.

Projection on this is nuclear, and I often catch myself frequently smelling that indulgent vanilla pipe tobacco note throughout the 12+ hours of longevity I get. TV is a fragrance that announces your presence for you as you walk through doors, not the other way around. As a caveat to that, I find that it's not a typical work-friendly day fragrance for most people and wears easier during the colder times of the year.

To me, this is the best of the Tom Ford Private Blend."

but on fabric, it's a little bit different. its similar in terms where it opens with cloves. but 1½ hour later the vanilla appears, albeit very faint. and i could pick up other notes like dried fruits, honey and tobacco (even though honey isn't written as a note), which also are all quite faint. this is bcs the cloves note is very dominant on fabric. the cloves is very dominant, they could've named it ""cloves vanille"" haha.
to me, the vanilla in TV is more ""in the air"" rather than on the skin/fabric. i did the sillage test where i spray this on my pillow, hours later got out of the room and came back in after a few minutes to find the room smelling like vanilla, which apparently is more prominent than it is on my skin and fabric too! also,,, the ""in the air"" scent lasts only 4 hours, just like it does on my skin. though it does last longer on fabric, like any other fragrance.

I picked up a sample and all I could smell was a decadent Vanilla that radiated with my body heat. It pulsed and lived as though I was in a bakery getting ready to make treats for the family. I woke up the next day and I could still smell it around me. that's when I knew I wanted it.

So I ordered the 250 ml from Tom Fords site. I hated it when I tried it. There was an opening scent of christmas. Not sure what to call it but it smells just like the christmas aisle where they have all the wreaths. It was all I could smell. That was about a month ago. I don't know if my batch matured after being opened and exposed to air or if my nose is just getting better trained but I'm starting to get bathed in that rich decadent vanilla again.

Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","Tobacco Vanille is a pretty sweet scent, so if that turns you off you may not like this one. The sweetness is a bit stronger than the tobacco, and it's very reminiscent of a sticky honey scent. I get major honey vibes, and I think it's the dried fruit playing with the vanilla and tonka beans. The tobacco is definitely there though and plays off nicely with the sweetness.

The fragrance is quite linear: it's basically the tobacco honeyed sweetness and it's quite strong but pretty enjoyable in my opinion. The sweet smell is lovely smelling and not synthetic, but thick and rich. There's a small hint of spice and wood but it's in the background. Performance is pretty good as well.

This is certainly a scent that is very present- there's no subtlety about it, but it's warm and comforting- not harsh and abrasive, and I think it's perfectly unisex as well."

It is definitely not for everybody and I recomend to try it before buy. It is not for everyday use, maybe for somebody, who feels (or wants to feel) confident, strong, powerful and extravagant every day. Perfume starts very strong, you could say an alcohol feel, but then it goes into warm sweet tones, but as it is unisex, it's not like a mouth-sticking candy, which I appreciate. You have to be prepare that you will smell the perfume from yourself a whole day, which can be for somebody annoying and I can imagine it brings headache to somebody sensitive. But for people who like heavy intensive perfumes is this a good choice. For me it's one of my most favourite perfumes I have."

( if your backgrounds about men fragrances are basic designers, citrusy and a bit woody types of fragrances, I will tell you “your nose will be shocked when you first try tobacco vanille”)
The reason is that tobacco vanille has a real smell of fresh tobacco leaf and every note in TV is done with full of creativity that no one did it before and until now after all these years still there is nothing can beat TV.
So I wanna tell these people who talk shit about TV “train your nose and take a look on niche perfumery world and then try to judge TV fairly”.

I've sampled only 4 of them, and so far three of them have taken best-in-slot for me. Grey Vetiver is my favorite Fresh Vetiver, Ombre Leather is my favorite Leather, and now this is my favorite Vanilla fragrance. I generally don't like Vanilla fragrances (especially when powdery), which is why this one surprises me. It is one of only 2 Vanilla fragrances I like, yet it has zoomed all the way to my top 7 fragrances across all genres. This is an amazing tobacco-vanilla scent -- where for a change, the tobacco is in a support role instead of the lead. And it works really well, in my humble point of view.

This lasts a long time on me... I didn't need a re-spray the whole day from 8 to 5pm. Even after a shower, I could still smell traces of it on my wrist. It can also fill a room. Immediately after using 4 sprays, my wife smiled across the room. She loves Vanilla, and for a change I agree with her. If this weren't so pricey, I'd buy one for Christmas. However, I'm still waiting for my Grey Vetiver to arrive and am about to place an order for Ombre Leather... so this will have to wait until 2021. I would recommend this to everyone, but apparently this is a polarizing fragrance... so try first before you buy. But this is a LOVE for me."

First Impression: Incredibly harsh! I immediately wanted to take this perfume off me. I felt intoxicated and smelt as if I had just come from a Bar and absorbed all the smells of alcohol and cigarette smoke.

The Dry Down: Still pretty harsh and the smell is definitely emanating into my nose every time I breathe in. It smells like a combination of Spices, Pepper, Vanilla, Tobacco, and a lot like Potpurri.

Final Thoughts: I personally hate it, it's given me a slight headache, and I genuinely feel sick wearing it as if I'm going to throw up! I felt self-conscious the entire time I wore this as if people were scrunching their noses when I was around. This perfume will definitely fill the room, so be mindful of that.

Kinda worried that my boyfriend won't love it though but I bought it anyways since if he didn't liked it then I could wear it. Thankfully, he absolutely loved it. I LOVE this scent on him, it is INTENSELY sexy. One spray of it can make me go wild about him. It smells of cigarettes, with undertones of vanilla and some hints of spices that are so delectable. It weirdly goes well with my Marc Jacobs Daisy Eau So Fresh, its like the feminine type of this perfume. If you love heavy spices, a whiff of vanilla and cigarettes then this is for you. I love this because, this feels like this is my boyfriend's signature scent even before he wore this. He constantly smells like cigarettes and he wears spices perfumes before this one, add vanilla to the mix and voila, Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille is his long awaited scent. Be very wary though because this is a very strong and a very heavy scent and it lasts forever, in his case at least."

I happen to love this fragrance. I don’t wear it or own a bottle, but an ex-boyfriend of mine used to wear it and he smelled absolutely incredible. It’s smokey and sweet with hints of spices in all the right places. It’s bold, yet very smooth and blended well. The vanilla is so luxe in this one. It’s a gorgeous warm and rich fragrance to wear during colder months. The lasting power is 10/10. I don’t smoke, but if you are a smoker, I feel like Tobacco Vanille would work well to hide the scent of cigarettes because of the deep tobacco note blended with the smooth vanilla.

I picked up a sample because of the hype, and because I wasn't too big a fan of Herod which people compared this to. To my nose, Herod is a cherry pipe tobacco through and through. This is different. This reminds me of Christmas when I was a kid and my mom would put out these wax candles to make the house smell like holiday spices. It's definitely tobacco + vanilla, but not like I've smelled before, where the notes were blended to invoke other memories. This is like deliberate in-your-face tobacco leaf plus some warm, cozy, slightly spicy vanilla. Quite intriguing. Quite strong. Straight down the middle unisex.

I did expect it to be something between Noir Extreme and Tobacco Oud.

Meanwhile it is completely different smell.
Is it bad? Not at all, but I am not enjoying it as much, just because I did expect something totally different. That's simply my fault.

Although it is an interesting and quite unique smell, I myself wouldn't consider it as unisex. To me personally it fits more for ladies. Which is quite weird, because I have no problem wearing Extreme Noir, which seems to be more sweet and ""flamboyant"".

I think that it has quite intense opening, which might be the reason I don't enjoy it as much, because the longer it dries down, the more I like it.

Anyways, me personally I won't be wearing it much often, and I'm glad I got only a decant instead of buying a whole bottle. Because it wouldn't be used by me that much."

Ask any east or southeast Asian you know, they'll agree.

I googled a little more, then found what's responsible for that distinctive scent of huamei(=Tobacco Vanille):

Licorice.

To replicate this scent with 100% precision, first you need some extremely tart fruits, too sour to be eat alone, let them dried up with salt, treat them with a shit load of licorice, sprinkle them with cinnamon and clove powder, and round off the rough edges with vanillin: now you got the perfect Tobacco Vanille opening.

The latter half of the journey, if you ask me, mimics another Asian drink: rose oolong tea.

Oolong tea is a type of half fermented ""black"" black tea, smells incredibly dry and bitter with a whiff of ""rusty"" fermented hint

Getting close to your skin, the bitter and dried core of Tobacco Vanille smells exactly like dried oolong tea leaves; smells from afar, it has a hidden rosy aura.

The dry down has lost its shape, just a vague mix of all aforementioned notes, maybe adding some oily-coconut-y coumarin, along with a few drop of honey adding a little depth and animalic hint."

And th scent, though not smelling straight up different, has nice subtle nuances...

Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","The name alone tells you most everything you need to know about this fragrance, but because I like to be longwinded, I’ll say more. What’s offered here is a sweet and spicy tobacco. You get aromatic properties wafting above vanilla and dried fruits. It creates a distinguished, mature scent that leans masculine to my nose. Well suited to a black jacket as well as a warm sweater, Tobacco Vanille is a fragrance that projects an aura of authority, while still remaining approachable and welcoming. The spiciness mixes with a dried fruitiness to create a very homey fragrance that may even resemble scents associated with holidays. On my skin, more sweetness comes out than on paper, making Tobacco Vanille warm and very cozy. This also keeps the fragrance in firm unisex territory, even if I find it leaning masculine through the total experience. Regardless, a perfect choice for when the leaves begin to change color and fall from the trees.

I’m reasonably certain Tobacco Vanille has earned its place as a classic and it’s easy to recognize as such from the first sniff. The joy of the wear is how the fragrance reveals its different facets and complexity as time goes on. I really wish Tom Ford would introduce this into his Signature Line and make it more affordable. As it is though, Tobacco Vanille is certainly on the shortlist of fragrances everyone new to the hobby might like to get acquainted with, especially if interested in fragrances for the colder months.. I’m fairly certain Toboacco Vanille is one of Tom Ford’s most well-known fragrances, and assuming I’m correct, it’s easy to see why. This is a rich and rewarding fragrance that illustrates the motifs of the house. As such, it serves as a perfect introduction to a major brand and voice. Commanding, indulgent and sexy under the right circumstances, Tobacco Vanille is a beautifully blended fragrance that plays on the opposites of strong and sweet. A serious candidate for inclusion in the Fragrance Hall of Fame."
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","This scent is a complete time machine- it takes me back 15+ odd years when I rolled my own cigarettes and ventured into playful trial with coarse flavoured pipe-tobacco for many months. I had two faves, cherry and plum, especially the latter - giving absolutely exquisite delicious olfactory trail often complimented. It didn't smell like anything remotely similar to sharp disgusting aftermath of a real cigarette, but was instead sweet, fruity, slightly dark and aromatic. It was my secret conversation starter over many parties until I finally got a bit tired and even sick of it.

TF Tobacco Vanille is the exact replica of this scent, it even brings about nausea I once felt after over-doing my roll-ups. Photo-realistic plum pipe tobacco with artificial sweetness. It doesn't change in development, keeping the fruity note for hours in contrast with smokiness.

I fully understand the attraction, but for me its quite a simple scent. And it is strange to hear so much about TV only to discover its all about bog-standard flavoured pipe tobacco. There is nothing missing, nothing extra. Perhaps TV comes across too sweet on woman's skin and plays more intresting on men. More woody? more spicy? chocolate? some cinnamon even? On me it just candied plum and tobacco, so not super impressed. Btw, its much better as a trail from a slight distance, not for wrist sniffing."
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","The opening note of Tobacco Vanille is so wonderful - it really reminds me of sniffing my uncle's tobacco before he'd roll a cigarette, a scent I have always loved. As it dries down, TV becomes increasingly sweet. In that stage it lasts on me forever - I usually spray this in the evening and still smell it when I wake up.

I've heard a lot of people describe this as sexy, and I guess it could be, but for me this is the more of a home alone, time to kick back scent. It also is Christmassy, as many have noted, yes - something in here reminds me of the heat of a room in December while everyone is eating and drinking.

Wouldn't buy a full bottle for perhaps that very reason - it's a wonderfully indulgent, gluttonous fragrance - but I really love wearing my decant every now and then. Comforting and delicious, in small doses; just like Christmas."

Smelled decent on opening, walked around for 30 mins, sniffed again and O.M.G....""Yum!""

There is a hidden note of cinnamon here. Near a true masterpiece, but not a perfect 10/10, feels too linear simple of ingredients to label it that, but damn well pretty close! This is SEXY!!! It's so fucking good on the dry-off that i can't stop smelling myself. Im trying to be careful as a new enthusiast on buying up too many bottles which i later label 'above average', but this scent is an instant buy! One of my fav vanilla colognes ive smelled to date entering the niche zone.

Smells like rich aged real vanilla sitting in your cubard for a long time, dried fruits, a hint of quality pipe tobacco that is not over-powering where it compliments the other note perfectly, and it's also decently blended, but does give a slightly sourness to the frag which some tobaccos are known to do. But, the ingredients do smell not fresh, like old sitting in the kitchen cupboard for too long to use...lol Doesn't perform as good as 'Black Phantom' in every way, smaller scent bubble, smaller longevity, could barely smell it on me when i wore both of them on my arms, but i could smell 'Black Phantom'. I will also add that 'Herod' by Parfums De Marly is absolutely better than this as well in every way - richer in scent, superior quality in scent, silage, scent bubble, better quality ingredients, dark rich and fresher. So Tom Ford's Tobacco Vanille is 3rd Place in my books to date for this frag's scent genre of tobacco/vanilla combo.

This reminds me of fall. Like a candle or a high end version of that smell that hits you when you walk into Michael's Arts and Crafts. The spicy woods are there from the beginning. The dried fruits with the spices give it that Michael's smell that I'm talking about.

It becomes more sweet after the spicy opening dies down, probably because of the vanilla and cacao. I think the tobacco blossom and tonka bean give it a smooth dryness.

This is a very beautiful scent, and I do like it a lot, but I just can't really see myself ever wearing it. I'm just not a fan of spiced fruit. Makes me feel like I'm smelling one of those holiday fruit cakes nobody eats."

Just fyi, I'm 19, so I'm still pretty young. This was the first time I've ever smelt the tobacco scent, and I gotta tell y'all it knocked me off my feet. I was not expecting the pleasantness of the smell. The tobacco mixed with the sweet vanilla, just omg, SUPERB! I see a lot of reviews saying it's only for the mature, but I think it may work out on young adults too. It's absolutely captivating and seductive, it really spells out confidence as well as it charms. The dry-down of the scent is just as good. I only wish I could afford to buy a bottle of Tobacco Vanille, but unfortunately it's quite outside what I can afford."

People may write that they hate it, but ultimately this one is immortal. All at once it is vanilla cream custard, rich honeyed tobacco, dried Christmas fruits, fruitcakes dense with brandy, Yankee candles, hints of smoke and pine needles, a burst of tea, silken dense chocolat chaud a la Marie Antoinette (that is to say, dark and milk French chocolate melted in almond milk and cream, with vanilla pods), antique Cuban humidors.
Many facetious remarks have addressed the disconnect between the English ""Tobacco"" and French ""Vanille"" of the name - perhaps it is a subtle nod to the concept of ""French Vanilla"" ice cream being deeper, denser, and sweeter with the addition of eggs as opposed to ""Philadelphia"" or ""American style"" Vanilla which goes without; therefore the vanilla in this corresponds to that French deeper, denser, sweeter vanilla accord. ""Tobacco French Vanilla"" doesn't roll off the tongue quite as well.

Between my 2015 bottle and my new 2020 one, I don't see any differences in longevity or sillage or complexity."

My god the price, like i understand it is a high fashion brand but can we just stop and think of the idea of paying 170 euros for a 30 ml bottle????!!!?? need A DUPE!!!

It is not worth the money but it is a perfect vanille tobacco combination that i would love to have in my signature fragrances collection.

Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","Tobacco Vanille. What a journey!
Definitely sublimated by the summer night heat. Dried fruit is plunged headlong, dipped in cherry liqueur. Black cherries, pine nuts, prunes, apricots, raisins all emerge alternately. Some dried figs are also figured and synthesized by the bitter taste of dryer peel.
Vanilla does not respond to my appeal. My relatively inexperience prevents me from recognizing it. In fact, I cannot say at what stage and level it appears.
My personal tastes thank the fact in this circumstance. There is no need for vanilla on this beautiful travel I follow to delight my senses.
A good lit cigar that yes, it wouldn't hurt. Smoked by a visitor in this cigar lounge, while ecstatic I sip this idyllic ""rhum"", so pleased and flattered, satisfied in taste.
It's a sensory walk so long, beautiful and comforting that I can only hope for a sequel, aspiring with imminence to find a place for Tobacco Vanille's orient next to my treasures."

I picked this up in an airport, and it's well worth the price. It smells sexy and sophisticated; the tobacco is realistic without smelling obnoxious. The vanilla ties in really well and tones down the harshness of the fragrance. Lasts all day and has pretty heavy sillage, at least for the first few hours. This is the first time I've been able to wear a tobacco fragrance out. 10/10."

I personally like Tobacco Vanille more than Vanille Fatale, although might have been a bad day when I tried VF. I might give it another sniff one day."

Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","I believe the hype! If you like the smell of tobacco, this is going to give you just that - the smell of high-quality, unburned tobacco leaves. Since I actually briefly smoked a pipe, and more for the smell than the nicotine, this is wonderful for me. The vanilla, too, comes in strong, but a lighter, airier vanilla, and not an ooey-gooey gourmandy one. It reminds me of the vanilla in Spiritueuse Double Vanille. Finally there is a tonka/spice spiciness hovering over things but not overpowering them. The spicy note reminded me of the ghost of the ghost of Grand Soir.

This smelled the same on me start to finish - which made me very happy, since I did not want it to go away."

Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","There certainly is no deception or false advertising in the name here, Tobacco Vanille is exactly that - unlit, sweet pipe tobacco. It smells very much like standing in the humidor of a fine tobacconist. No clove or cinnamon or old brandy to mix things up a bit - just lots of sweet vanilla tobacco (with maybe a leaf or two of cherry tobacco thrown in). It's an universally loved aroma, and this EDT recreates it almost perfectly. The trade-off is that there isn't a whole lot of depth or complexity to Tobacco Vanille. It's a great replication of a smell that already exists in the world, and whether or not that is a mark by which a great perfume is judged is open for debate."

Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille opens with a moderate projection of very sweet tobacco, vanilla, and tonka bean notes. Other than tobacco, the opening is very sweet and gourmand. The tobacco note in this fragrance is intense but aromatically soft, in other words, it feels like the scent of a blond, light-bodied, and very refined cigarette as opposed to the scent of a very dark and strong cigar. As the fragrance settles down, the dried fruit notes come up and intensify the already very sweet tones but they do not become prominent. The cacao, woody, and spicy notes are in the back, they contribute with a touch but nothing prominent. Once Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a moderate projecting, very sweet, blond tobacco, vanilla, and tonka bean fragrance with soft fruity, spicy, and woody notes. The fragrance feels fragrant, semi-gourmand, more masculine than feminine, mature, modern, natural, rich, sticky, very sweet, syrupy, warm, and pleasant.

BATCH REVIEWED: 2020.
WOW RATING: 6/10. It is a mildly pleasant fragrance; the tobacco note is overly refined.
DISLIKE RATING: 5/10. Some people will find the tobacco note somehow offensive although it feels very refined. The vanilla, tonka bean, and dried fruit tones are overly sweet.
UNIQUENESS: 4/10. Tobacco fragrances are relatively common. Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille does not feel unique.
MASS APPEAL: 5/10. The tobacco is not a mass-appeal note.
PROJECTION: 4/10. Moderate, about 4 feet around the wearer.
SILLAGE: 4/10. Moderate, about 4 feet behind the wearer.
APPLICATION: Two to four atomizations will suffice. Additional atomizations will make the fragrance excessively sweet.
LONGEVITY: 4/10. Moderate, about four hours with 2 of good projection.
SEASONS: Winter and fall. The fragrance is excessively sweet for spring or summer.
OCCASIONS: Formal events, outdoor gatherings, casual, holidays, clubbing.
VERSATILITY: 5/10. Limited to colder months and mostly casual occasions.
GENDER: Masculine. Advertised as unisex, the tobacco notes in this fragrance, although very refined, it is a masculine note.
AGES: 30 and above.
RECOMMENDATION: Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille can be found discounted for approximately $188 but just 1.7oz. Its cost/value ratio is very poor, furthermore, there are other fantastic tobacco fragrances with similar quality and performance priced more reasonably. Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille is a nice-to-have, but not a must-have.
BLIND-BUY: No, sample it first. The tobacco note is excessively refined and the sweetness is very high.
SIMILAR: The following fragrance contain tobacco and sweet notes, but don’t necessarily smell like Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille. John Varvatos Dark Rebel Rider, from the designer world, this fragrance is dark with incense, tobacco and leather notes, but moderate to low performance; similarly, John Varvatos Dark Rebel brings to the table woody, leathery, tobacco, spices, and boozy notes, a very masculine scent; Azzaro Wanted By Night EDP features tobacco, cinnamon, citrus, and vanilla notes and it is fantastic; Burberry London Men is a very affordable tobacco, cinnamon, woody, spicy and leather fragrance; Dolce & Gabbana The One EDP is a fantastic fragrance with good performance featuring amber, warm spicy, tobacco, aromatic, citrus, and sweet notes; Paco Rabanne 1 Million Prive EDP, combines tobacco, cinnamon, and orange notes creating a great performing fragrance; Parfums De Marly Herod Men EDP is a great niche, a tobacco-based fragrance with outstanding performance; Thierry Mugler - Angel A*Men Pure Havana may be one of the best bold tobacco-based designer fragrances; Cuba Royal Men EDT features vanilla, cedar, and tobacco notes and, it is very affordable; Animale by Animale is good tobacco, balsamic, and fruity fragrance with great longevity; Amouage Memoir Men EDP is a great niche, darker, tobacco, woods, incense, and leather fragrance;
SUMMARY: A moderate projecting, very sweet, blond tobacco, vanilla, and tonka bean fragrance with soft fruity, spicy and woody notes, that feels fragrant, semi-gourmand, more masculine than feminine, mature, modern, natural, rich, sticky, very sweet, syrupy, warm, and pleasant."

I thought it was a really mediocre fragrance the first two times I tested it at the retail counter. Then, by pure chance when I was bored testing some Creeds, I sprayed it on my skin, and it was MAGICAL. The first time ever I get so amazed. And now, I even think of it being better than the ever so hyped PDM CARLISLE!!
I haven't tested other people's reactions, but, I honestly don't care! I'ld pay the money to buy the state of mind this fragrance delivers.

Edit: After weeks of testing them side by side, I can confidently say, keeping in mind my big dislike of the brand of Tom Ford, that this is better than Carlisle.

Edit II: This has become my favorite fragrance of all time! I haven't tested thousands but I'm close and I can't find anything that gets close to this guy.... In the course of it's complexity and subtlety, I am beginning to see that it gives some mysterious vibes to the wearer."

The sexiest scent I have ever experienced. Perfectly unisex. The price tag is eye-watering, but this baby is worth every cent. A smooth blend that cannot be replicated by dupes. Definitely for cold weather as its heavy, warming, spicy and lush - I definitely get a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove wrapped in a richly sweet vanilla. The tabacco is my favourite part of this. it's dusty, dry, velvety and oh so sexy."
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","Probably the biggest compliment getter in my collection. I would never have guessed it would be since the tobacco and spicy notes definitely are noticeable, and not usually ""easy"" or mass appealing. In the dry down however, they get a little bit pushed to the side by the vanilla and that's usually about the time when people compliment me on my scent. It lasts an enormous amount of time and projects very nicely without being offensive. I would be a little cautious with wearing it in hot weather, although I have to admit, I have and didn't get any complaints. A beautiful nighttime scent, especially great for cozy scenarios during the fall and winter. Also, a perfect unisex scent that I love to share with my boyfriend. I highly recommend it!"
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","The real spice bomb!

This fragrance is very interesting. It's not what I expected. I would not call this sweet, this is in the spicy category for me. This smells like a spice cabinet that contains a fresh bag of pipe tobacco with some dark vanilla. I also smell cloves and cinnamon. It's a great fragrance, wonderful for winter and cold weather. This is not mass appealing at all, especially if worn in the wrong situation. If you're expecting this to smell like most other leather fragrances (like the inside of a new leather interior car), then you're in for a surprise. Imagine the kitchen in an old bakery in Germany cranking out fruitcake after fruitcake. This is an experience I haven't smelled before (on my skin). This is what I wish V&R Spicebomb smelled like. Get a sample to try before buying a bottle."
Tobacco Vanille Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['vanilla', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'warm spicy', 'fruity', 'cacao', 'woody', 'powdery']","Powerful, mass appealing and amazing.

This is one of my favourite fragrances. This is a safe blind-but in my opinion. This smells sweet, but has this strong backbone of tobacco that runs throughout. This is simply an amazing scent. In terms of projection and sillage, this is just beastly on my skin. People can smell it all day, and people will definitely smell it walking past you and you will smoke out a room wearing a lot of this.

It’s funny, but I smell the melon more than anything else. I don’t even like citrusy smells! Lol. I adore this and always get asked what I’m wearing.

Un Jardin Sur Le Nil Hermès (unisex) ~ 2005,"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'floral', 'fresh spicy', 'green', 'fruity', 'tropical', 'powdery', 'herbal', 'sweet']","When I first smelled this fragrance I was so smitten with it that I actually asked the complete stranger who was wearing it for its name. This has become by far my favourite, and despite having quite a big assortment of other fragrances, I immediately bought 2 of it out of fear that they might stop producing it any time soon (if Hermès ever discontinues this line, I will be heartbroken). It's definitely unisex, which is right up my ally since sweet perfumes nauseate me. I was actually surprised that there are people who dislike it since I assumed everybody likes citrussy fragrances, silly me ofc :)"
Un Jardin Sur Le Nil Hermès (unisex) ~ 2005,"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'floral', 'fresh spicy', 'green', 'fruity', 'tropical', 'powdery', 'herbal', 'sweet']","I can already tell this is one of those divisive fragrances that has the people who love it down-voting every person who says something bad about it, but I can see why. Sur Le Nil is one of those fragrances that you either love or hate, there isn't much in-between. You really have to love citrus scents to get fully on board with this. It opens with a heavy, very bitter grapefruit and I personally also pick up on a bitter lime note as well. It's just pure bitter citrus to my nose. There's a definite spice that comes through but not a typical pepper spice and not a fall, cozy warm spice. I think the spiciness helps a bit with the overwhelming citrus. The musk is pretty strong too, but again this is a good thing to help combat that bitterness from the grapefruit. The tomato and carrot perhaps are giving this scent a strange herbal quality that doesn't smell medicinal or tea-like, but someone before me mentioned a V8 drink and that's honestly exactly where the odd herbal quality is going in my opinion. The floral notes give the overall scent an underlying rosey scent. I don't detect any mango at all, just the citrus.

Sur Le Nil is 100% a late spring and summer, daytime scent. I don't think it leans too feminine or masculine, definitely a perfectly unisex fragrance. To me, it smells a little too much like a cleaner like it could be a scent in the Fabuloso cleaner line primarily because of that strong citrus accord. On the bright side, it doesn't seem to change much from opening to dry down so if you're looking for a super citrus-heavy fragrance that doesn't just die out in an hour and dry to something barely citrusy like most other citrus scents, then this might be a good choice for you. This one isn't for me, but I'm eager to try Mediterranee and see if that is more suitable for me."
Un Jardin Sur Le Nil Hermès (unisex) ~ 2005,"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'floral', 'fresh spicy', 'green', 'fruity', 'tropical', 'powdery', 'herbal', 'sweet']","This is so utterly revolting. I think it’s the tomato leaf. I’ve never had such a strong reaction to a perfume - minus that one Le Labo Rose scent. I have no idea why but this truly makes me feel like vomiting. I feel like a walking can of V8. I get a little bit of musk and citrus but mostly tomato leaf and carrot.

If you like tomato leaf and carrot, then this is for you. But it’s REALLY not for me. 🤢"
Un Jardin Sur Le Nil Hermès (unisex) ~ 2005,"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'floral', 'fresh spicy', 'green', 'fruity', 'tropical', 'powdery', 'herbal', 'sweet']","It is just a magic ! It is magical ! Once you wear it, in a few minutes you feel happy, chilled out and calm. Fresh, different, calming and rises up the mood. At first hour you feel like passing through the woods, by the time goes on by the day, you feel clean and revitalized evert hour.
Actually I was wondering much more about the Le Jardin de Monsieur Li, but when I tried both, Monsieur Li gave me the sense like a room refreshner or the hotel scent. Also it was extremely strong at first step. Then I tried Sur Le Nil and there it was! This was not an ordinary fragrance, It has its own property on your skin and well combined with your skin. Thus, this combination was creating its own empire.
If you would like to feel different, happy and self confident, try Sur Le Nil. Totally another type of experience ."

However, I also wish I hadn't read that...because my association with EA Green Tea is so negative that now I can't get the association out of my head, and when I smell Jardin Sur Le Nil on my wrist it starts to nauseate me.

Un Jardin Sur Le Nil Hermès (unisex) ~ 2005,"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'floral', 'fresh spicy', 'green', 'fruity', 'tropical', 'powdery', 'herbal', 'sweet']","This has a zinger of an opening - tart, in-your-face citrus freshness, almost too bitter, like someone chucking a gin & tonic in your face. It very quickly softens to something I really wasn't expecting. It has the best longevity of a citrus fragrance that I've experienced, but that is relative to other citrus frags - it's still pretty short-lived. But what remains is a delightful slightly spiced, slightly sweetened skin scent. I was expecting green herbal for the life of the scent, but what's there is much warmer and friendlier, while still retaining an outdoor, green note. I really like it. Sounds a bit odd, but this is the sort of frag I would wear on a long car/train journey. I get really motion sick, and fresh fragrances really help to lift me out of the headachey nausea. It's a personal one, stays close to the skin so it's for me and my tactile friends only. I quite like that - only if someone leans in will they get a waft.

updating this a few days later: I bloody love this!! Have worn it every day. It needs a re-spray every now and again so my 15ml bottle really isn't going to last long! I feel like I've been trying to find this scent for years, subconsciously. Love it."
Un Jardin Sur Le Nil Hermès (unisex) ~ 2005,"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'floral', 'fresh spicy', 'green', 'fruity', 'tropical', 'powdery', 'herbal', 'sweet']","I literally watched every review of this one then I got myself a full bottle with some huge expectations on it but it dissapoints me big time. This smells like a generic Elizabeth Arden Green Tea which is fragrance I don't like. This has been raved by youtubers as Jean Claude Ellena's masterpiece but to my nose its so boring. Better sample it first before getting a full bottle. Your olfactory senses is the true barometer not the senses of others.

Tho I'm not closing my doors on this one, hopefully I will like this in the future but right now this is a complete dud. If you love Elizabeth Arden Green Tea this would be a great addition to your collection. If you hate that fragrance stay away from this.

I asked her for a summer scent that was present and long lasting.

I also got a bottle of H24 at the same tine and I haven’t even opened it yet because I like this and want to wear it again tomorrow.

My collection but they don’t last like this right here! The Soleiel Blanc EDT and EDP lasts & Are the best of the summer frags IMO and of course TV is great for winter ❄️ but TV is not a Beach 🏖 summer frag. I wanted to try the new soleil Brulant but I’m tired of dropping 350 for a perfume with f’n amazing openings then a becomes a skin scent by hour 2-3 (original Private Blend costta Azzura, fucking fabulous, Tuscan leather ) so I went with this and I am not even disappointed. I mean I literally was able to smell this on me for a good 7 to 8 hours. The grapefruit and mango settle down to a nice fresh dry down that evolves to a deep and heavy layer of musk and mango w/ a hint of grapefruit but then the tomatoe comes in there right behind it ever so lightly... this is good stuff for the price point and to be an EDT it’s 🔥!"

Un Jardin Sur Le Nil Hermès (unisex) ~ 2005,"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'floral', 'fresh spicy', 'green', 'fruity', 'tropical', 'powdery', 'herbal', 'sweet']","""For the Gardeners""

Un Jardin Sur La Nil is a masterclass in how to do a fruity aromatic. The initial blast of zesty citrus-mango-tomato plant is a summer garden in a bottle. I absolutely love, love, love wearing this when it gets really hot and humid in the summer and I need something to cut through that languid yucky muggy muckiness. The tomato plant note is realistic and makes me feel nostalgic for helping my parents in our garden as a child. I feel like this scent will appeal to those who have experience with gardening and are outdoorsy nature types. The longevity is poor and sillage nonexistent. You just have to enjoy those initial 20 minutes so much that it makes it worth it."
Un Jardin Sur Le Nil Hermès (unisex) ~ 2005,"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'floral', 'fresh spicy', 'green', 'fruity', 'tropical', 'powdery', 'herbal', 'sweet']","Good God this is a bracing freshie! I have never come across a scent with such a strong, agressive and astringent opening until I got this, and thats no bad thing.

I initially wanted to purchase Un Jardin Sur Le Toit when looking for a scent which accurately replicated the scent of freshly cut grass, but when I sampled it, as nice as it is, it just didnt have enough greenness in it for my liking, I've on and off sampled Un Jardin En Mediterranee and liked it, but when I read the notes for this, I was really lured in; mango, grapefruit, lotus, tomato AND incense? I wondered how a summer freshie with incense would work, I never really felt like incense was a light and airy note, but I was happy to be proven wrong.

From smelling the sprayer, it smelt fresh and like the usual oceanic, citrussy summer scents I normally go for, but upon spraying it I thought my nose was going to explode; sharp, fresh, bracing citrusses and cold arctic air, I was half asleep but upon aplication I felt pretty damn perked up! who needs coffee when this exists?! (Ok, I still need coffee, keeps my inner Gilmore Girl happy)
After 10 minutes the harshness from the opening settles down and a very natural grapefruit emerges with some mango, but the mango note doesnt smell synthetic or juvenile nor does it dominate the crisp citrusses, it adds some extra depth and a more ""fleshy"" feel with tomato and lotus adding some aquatic greenness and making this scent feel fresh, the best thing with this one is, throughout wear it never loses its freshness or becomes ""BO"" like (Yes The Body Shop, I'm looking at your Pink Grapefruit EdT...) in the later stages of the drydown, bulbrush peaks out and I'm left with a slightly musky aquatic/herbal skinscent.

Longevity is very good for a citrus scent, 7 hours of wear from 4 spritzes with a light silage, its fresh, its invigorating, I'd say its perfect for casual and formal wear and very office friendly and I cannot wait to wear it during the summer months, I'll be repurchasing a 100ml bottle in the future, thats for sure!"
Un Jardin Sur Le Nil Hermès (unisex) ~ 2005,"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'floral', 'fresh spicy', 'green', 'fruity', 'tropical', 'powdery', 'herbal', 'sweet']","The opening of mango is strong, and grapefruit is apparent. What I've loved about this is how complex it is, there's a lot of fresh and exciting notes in there to discover, but also it lasts longer than most citrus fresh perfumes do....it must be the incense or musk... not that these are at all noticeable, but not sure what else is giving it that longevity. One of my faves."

It reminds me of the day we took a boat to the Aswan Botanical Garden on an island on the Nile. With the desert all around us, it was a perfect oasis for an afternoon break.

Would have hoped for this fragrance to develop into something more than that, because that could've possibly made it a perfect scent, but now it unfortunately stays like the opening. Which is nice. But would've liked some development.

Cooling, refreshing and invigorating. At the first whiff, you can easily detect the tartness of green mango, then a slight hint of sweetness from the carrot and lotus. Finally, it leaves a lingering trail of spicy incense note.
I love how unique and sophisticated this fragrance is, but its performance is rather quite disappointing as it only last for 2 to 3 hours on my skin. On the bright side, the perfume is discreet and subtle, making it a perfect fragrance for the workplace or warm environment."

I wear Sur Le Toit, Monsieur Li, and Sur Le Nil. Sur Le Nil is the most elegant and delicate. very complex. Like a very elegant and artistic person, but with kind and warm smile. The middle and base notes is the best.

I imagine them as:
Sur Le Toit: Cheerful summer, energic. Youthful and Loud
Sur Le Nil: Elegant summer, soft, calm, warm and kind. High class and Elegant
Monsieur Li: Calm Spring, soft and elegant, gentle and warm. Mature and Warm

I am male, wore Sur Le Nil about a year, I live in tropical country with hot and humid weather.. and I can say this perfume performs really well.. At first spray you will get citrusy and sour smell, I don't quite like the opening though.. But after maybe an hour, it turns out really soft. Very delicate and complex smell, very nice smell. I can't even tell what notes it is, but the middle and base notes it smells like fruit riping,but very soft. You can wear this to a party or formal and informal events, or even at home or travelling. Not a fit choice for office, except you wear it like an hour before you get to the office, because the opening is a bit strong."

It is very longlasting for an EDT (it behaves more like an extrait de parfum); it lasts over 24 hours on skin and a few days on hair and clothes. It is probably the longest lasting perfume I've had.

Longevity is moderate, about 5-6 hours with the first hour having some projection. After that it becomes more of a skin scent.

I forgot how much I like this for summer! I think I’ve been prejudiced against it because it has a noticeable lotus note, and I’ve always had it in my head that I don’t care for lotus. But I like it here!

The citrus and mango don’t last more than a minute or two for me after the first spray, but the drydown is such a stunning, green/aquatic floral - It just perfectly, perfectly evokes a riverside garden. I feel like I need to find a bottle of this before summer comes back around again."
Un Jardin Sur Le Nil Hermès (unisex) ~ 2005,"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'floral', 'fresh spicy', 'green', 'fruity', 'tropical', 'powdery', 'herbal', 'sweet']","So I was never a big fan of perfumes, mainly because I found them to be too strong (flashback to my early teens till univerity years). When I finally found out more about perfumes and what types they have and the variety ofc, I finally understood that I just haven't found my signature or well my scent. I was on a hunt for years after I bought my first perfume (lanvin eclat de fleurs). Something was missing though with that perfume, having used it for two years now I realised I was over that too girly smells and generic ones as well ( for reference i am 23). So I needed something different and unique- that is it. Something that would not smell like any other perfumes on the market right now- but that is too hard to find I thought, until I found this gem. This is the one, this is the unique, not smelling like that generic fruity, sweet teenager or rose type of in your face ( arrogant ) perfume. This here gives you a feeling that you are indeed walking near or in a garden, be it the Nile. From the first sniff I knew that this is a game changer. After spraying it on my skin I was surprised because seemingly it should have a tomato smell, yet i just got fresh veggies and that is it, but after letting it sit on my skin for a while, I knew that this gives your more than vegetable freshness. It has citrus it has even a very subtle note of sweetness to it- maybe the mango, but it is not a ripe one, more like... pear?. Yet, I still have not bought it because the other sur le toit stole my heart... but this one is still dear to me and I will defnitely add it to my ultimate signature collection once I can afford all my favourite Hermes scents. (Hermes house knows how to come up with amazing fragrances and that is for sure!!! Also I love Hermes' Eau de Rhubarbe Écarlate) Yaah the price point is something to consider when you want to have this in your collection, but i do believe it is worth the money.

The longevity of this perfume is actually very good- i was expecting maybe a 2-3 hours or something, but on me it lasted for 4-5h, even 6. Guess it could depend on the skin chemistry as well but I do think it can last longer than toilettes do.

I would recommend this gem to those who are tired of those generic perfumes that everyone smells like... to be honest i was on the look to find something fresh like the Chanel chance eau fraiche, it being a unisex fragrance as well then I think I hit the jackpot with this one as this one is targeted for both women and male ( like literally I could not gender categorize this, it just smells like a fragrance nothing too feminine or masculine). This is more than just a fresh smell. really give it a try and you will love it yourself and if you don't then I think you would be more for the sweet and mysterious scents rather than this one. I would go on with my review but i think it is already a bit too long. for the final thought-- this is defnitely a smell that would please any nose, because it isn't one of those in your face perfumes or too strong... it is just there on your skin, beautifully smelling."

There are too many clashing notes for me to truly like this. This smells like a vegetable garden competing with a flower garden. It's certainly unique and unexpected. It's also fresh - again, in an unexpected way - and entirely ""unisex"". My personal preference would lean masculine.

Silage is very soft (I did use a splash bottle, but I applied along my forearm, elbows, and neck), Longevity is moderate. This doesn't give me a headache or sinus issues due to scent sensitivity."

A very interesting and totally unique scent, but lacks any discernable mango for me. The grapefruit citrus punch is perfect for a hot summery day when you want something clean without smelling like floor cleaner (looking at you D&G Light Blue). I get a wonderful grapefruit scent taking center stage with a vegetal background (tomato, carrot). After the grapefruit opening dies down you smell more of the floral lotus. I do not get any incense, musk, iris or cinnamon, they must be blended in a very subtle and balanced way to provide heft without drowning out the top notes. I must say though, the grapefruit is a little *too* strong for me as I am generally averse to citrus-heavy scents and my nose tends to get overwhelmed when they are the focus. I wish I could smell more of the vegetal notes and lotus notes!"

Don’t let the tomato or bulrush notes scare you off. They’re perfect players supporting the mango. The fragrance opens bright but airy and slightly wet. It’s as if you’re smelling fresh air in the most beautiful divine tropical garden with the smell of mango drifting in. This is absolutely amazing. I’m a little confused on projection issues some are having. On my skin the siliage is pretty big even though the projection is moderate. There’s a definitive scent trail that comes from this. And it lasts fairly well for me too.

When You spray it you get grapefruit and green mango. After 10 minutes the lotus and the rest of the notes appear! Very aquatic and fresh. The lotus here gave it a very beautiful touch.

But now I finally bought Sur Le Nil from a friend whose wife does not like how it smells on his skin. Since this wife happens to be my friend U., the almighty perfume guru in our circles, there is really no arguing about that :-D

Sur le Nil is wonderful - a tart, green, sweet, uplifting, elegant haze. Not a single note comes out to greet me, but it makes me oh so very happy.

It is not long-lasting at all, I get out some 3 hours out of it, and it also gets soft quite fast. Far better in hot weather.

This has the same vibe as the Musc Imperial from Atelier Cologne, they do not smell the same but are in the same 'genre' and gave me the same impression.

Today I’m bought a new bottle and it 20% different from my old bottle I used. Current batch of ‘Sur Le Nil’ seem more sweet than the previous one, green mango dominant overall and now it a bit similarly to ‘Sur Le Toit’ sweetness. I’m not sure if Hermés trying to reformulate this or it batch variation. The current version is less unique and more pleasant for mass market. Sadly I love the way it smell unique like chili stalk in the old formular. Anyway I still like this line.

Old formula: Cattail dominant over the green mango make it feeling like fresh chili stalk, watery and green grass, less sweet and unique from other Jardins line.

New formula: Green mango upfront, cattail behind, much much more sweet and become something like ‘Sur Le Toit’ fruity sweetness, not so unique as before. Younger people will prefer current formula I think, but it loses it own character that people who love it remember."

When I first smelled the scent I already had visions of Egypt, green mangoes and sunlight reflecting off the Nile as described in the book.

I consider this to be a completely unisex fragrance. It has an almost bitter green opening and then mellows to a more balanced blend of green, florals and citrus with a slightly earthy, white musk undertone.

For me this is an easy-to-wear warm weather scent that is distinctive yet safe for work. It's one of the few fragrances I own that feels right on a hot dry day or during a warm spring rain. Sillage is light to medium but longevity isn't great for me - maybe 4 hours."

In warm weather, the vegetal notes really stand out in me, and I smell like I've been wrestling with a tomato plant, while being pelted with grapefruit segments. As much as I love the scent of tomato plants, it really is not good. It was fabulous on my husband. Fresh and green and gorgeous. It is very citrusy, as it was on me, but on him, there was not even a hint of mango.

Skin chemistry is weird. Anyway...

In cooler weather, the fruit, spice and incense stands out on me, and I just love it. On my husband, the cattail (bullrushes) note is a lot more prevalent, and it's very spicy and musky.

I've owned it for two years now. I started off with a sample, and decided to spring for a full bottle.

I get a nice green semi aquatic vibe from UJSN. The mango is front and center, and its sweetness is enhanced by the carrot. I also smell papyrus or cattails (bulrushes) giving it the green effect. I do smell some tomato leaf, but it isn't strong and surprisingly it doesn't turn me off like it has in other fragrances. There are floral notes that don't smell ""flowery"" to my nose. Some incense and rock rose anchor the whole creation.

I think this fragrance is 100% unisex.. It sits on the line. I asked coworkers what they thought, and it was basically 50/50. It's safe for the office and a refreshing spring /summer scent.

Sillage is decent, as is longevity. This is no performance monster, but it isn't weak either.

Very crisp, uplifting and with the right amount of lush sweetness. After that it goes into a green mango scent, realistic, not like some cheaper and usually very sweet wannabe mango scent.

Later on, some of the base notes develop. Mainly incense and labdanum, but don't let that fool you, no heaviness here, still quite crisp. Overall I must say, that the drydown has a very ""classic perfumery"" feel to me. I don't know if this has been reformulated, but even if so, it still retained the ""beginning of the century vibe"", meaning it's not any fleeting fresh modern composition, but a very classy Jean-Claude Ellena manuscript.

Together with the Aqua Allegoria line from Guerlain, I consider Les Jardines from Hermès as a real treasure in the perfume world.

On my skin, it opens as an unapologetic grapefruit, very bitter and realistic. After a couple of minutes, though, it merges with something that smells like unripe mangoes and tomato leaves. Maybe there's something else there, because it sweetens a bit too, but I can't identify what it is. Nonetheless, it stays super crisp and fresh for the whole duration of the experience (so far, 5h). The scent is very linear on my skin, and the projection is strong enough even after 5 h to catch a whiff every now and then.
Even though I'm not a big citrus fan, I can see myself reaching for this when the temperatures go higher than 30ºC. It's truly refreshing and can be used by men or women alike, as it's so green it becomes genderless.

I'd been wearing perfume all my adult life, good perfume too, but had never smelled anything so abstract and, as it seemed then, strange and unpredictable. I could not smell any of the individual notes and if asked would have said 'çitrusy, clean, strong but floaty, weird, expensive'.

After several years of testing Nil occasionally when I travelled (my city had no Hermes outlet then) I finally bought a bottle. By then I had smelled a lot of niche perfume and Nil did not seem nearly so distinctive. In fact, I began to find the development a bit linear and dull. To make matters worse, I once smelled it on a female executive (Nil is very easy to identify) of the sort who hires the best architects and interior decorators, keeps up with the trends, buys books by the metre and wears Hermes because it's expensive.

Recently I've gone back to Nil. The opening still startles me, but I appreciate that the perfumer had to land the perfume somewhere after that initial outburst of green mango and grapefruit. I've been wearing it again in these late summer days and whereas the drydown once seemed dull, now I find it both calming and refreshing. Nil lingers all day on me. It harmonises with summer cotton and linen shirts, either at work or on weekends.

Nil not so hard to find now and the FOMO gang has long since moved on from it. Like its companion, Sarah Jessica Parker's Lovely (anyone who has read Chandler Burr's book knows what I mean), Nil has been around long enough to have entered a new phase; I notice from the reviews here that people are starting to get nostalgic for the days when their mothers wore it.

My executive friend is probably wearing Santal 33 now."

The aroma leaves a foot and a half inside the female vibe, surpassing the streaks of the unisex. Comfortable and easy to please. Strong projection of 2 meters for 2 hours. Re-experiencing a new sample (from a normal frag) in 2019: I detect a big difference - I feel the mango much greener, the floral content is much less impactful and an earthy chord under that floral-fruity chord. The potency is also much lower - weak. But the scent now pleases me more, is more balanced."

Quite an abstract composition with a bit of complexity, part synthetic and part as natural as sliced watermelon. The dry-down on my skin veers more towards musk than woods, which is a plus for warm-weather scents. In fact, it blooms quietly in hot weather, with close sillage and admirable persistence for something that seems so brittle. It's similar in vibe to some of the other Les Jardin perfumes, especially Sur Le Toit, but is still utterly unique. A pleasure to wear in summer, and sometimes a burst of joy in the dead of winter.

Yes, thanks to Demeter Fragrance Library, I totally get the tomato. But I also totally get cucumber and LOTS of celery.

I love that note in all of those scents (Tomato, Book and No. 04), but not in this one. For me, the pepper was overwhelming and the celery far too bitter. It's very unique, but I'd go with one of those others if I was looking for a vegetal scent. And don't be shy - - it's not like you'll smell like a produce bin, but... kind of!"

Fully unisex, a very creative blend of vegetable-earthy notes (dont expect to be able to pick out the carrot and tomato, it's just an overall green mist) with a triumphing note of grapefruit all throughout.
The sillage is the downside, it sits close to the skin and lasts half an evening long. That said, the atomizer chosen by Hermés is stellar and the weak sillage can be compensated by a generous application.
Appropriate for all seasons.

The projection starts strong, then after 2-3 hours it's closer to skin, still sniffable, but fainter and fainter. Maybe 3 hours of good performance. It seems I could still catch some green notes during the day when my skin was warmer, but it was really random, I didn't smell anything most of the time.

I test it on my cleavage at the perfume store. My mom didn't like it at first, it was too odd and strong to her, I personally found it interesting and different. She thought it was better after 2 hours when it was softer. We were in a heatwave and it seems like it was the right moment to wear it. When I got home, I put back my comfy clothes and I smelled more the perfume that I wore the day before (Lolita Lempicka), with a bit of greenth in the background. The longevity didn't impress me.

I don't hate Un Jardin Sur Le Nil, I think it could be agreeable at the right timing, I love the idea, I found it less screechy than Un Jardin Sur La Lagune, I wish I got a sample to test it more, but I don't think it lasts and that I love it enough to buy it.

For a tart, slightly bitter herbal fresh scent, this one has excellent performance. I don't understand how Hermes' freshies can last well and more expensive fresh scents (looking at you, Tom Ford) are pathetic in their performance.

My only issue with this one is that I don't actually like the scent itself. It's a bit linear and typical for me. I've been more impressed with others from this line. But if this is your vibe, this lasts well on hot, sweaty skin, working in the garden and washing up afterwards, for currently around 6 hours. That's killer performance.

It's green, refreshing, clean and citrusy - but in a different way than most 'citrus' perfumes. It has an inscrutable quality to it, and I had trouble picking out individual notes. It was simply 'green and citrusy but different' to my nose.

I realised it reminded me of a summer by the pool when my granny was using some sort of cheap facial spray (by oriflame, i think). The spray smelled exactly like this. And probably lasted longer.

It opens with juicy grapefruit, lotus and than... it's gone before i can find the other notes.

It's a nice thing to spray over yourself in hot days, when you don't really want to use a fragrance. But body sprays by adidas are so much cheaper and do the job just as well.

It is extremely sophisticated, which one would expect nothing less from Hermes. Lasting power is excellent for a fresh scent, this lasts all day on me, and in the evening, you're left with this beautiful juicy mango scent that lingers and catching whiffs of it is so invigorating and uplifting. It is fresh but not in a D&G Light Blue way, and its fruity, but not in an Escada way. The vegetation coupled with the fruits and the florals is what gives this scent such a sophisticated edge.

As it starts to dry down lotus note (similiar to Nautica Voyage) joins the party making the combination soothing and calming. This beautiful amalgamation of notes is backed by Ellena's signature Iso-E super note giving it an earthy (not dirty) vibe.

Imagine yourself walking in the fields of fruits and vegetables on a cloudy day, you kneel down, pick up the soil and rub it in your hands; thinking how beautiful is nature. This is how i picture this fragrance.

I was trying to figure out *exactly* what it reminded me of - and then it hit me.

The smell of a freshly opened bottle of fruit flavored chewable antacids (or is it conjuring the *taste* of said antacids? you know how something can smell just exactly the way something tastes? but not actually smell like said thing? i haven't quite got that figured out).

Luckily this stage doesn't last too long on me (I don't hate it but I still don't like being reminded of antacid tablets). The chalky feeling goes away quickly and soon I'm left with mostly grapefruit, with an aquatic feeling from the lotus and the tomato leaf peeking out all crisp and bold in the background.

For the money, I decided that it was time to look for a new signature scent. This is definitely better in the warmer weather, too. In winter, the fragrance stays quite sharp and never reaches that pretty, fluffy watery state. That being said, I haven't completely given up on this one.

Oh yah, it's kind of a chameleon so you get different scents depending on when you spray. So if you like complex fragrances, this is a good one."
Un Jardin Sur Le Nil Hermès (unisex) ~ 2005,"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'floral', 'fresh spicy', 'green', 'fruity', 'tropical', 'powdery', 'herbal', 'sweet']","Y'all are going to laugh, but on my skin the most prominent note is incense, which is the scent they hit you with ON BLAST at Disney World Florida when you're on that ride in Epcot (the giant golf ball) and you discover ROME IS BURNING!!! But I digress... Obviously this fragrance is above and beyond that. I don't want to trivialize anything about this masterpiece because it is an experience like no other. The citrus notes are absolutely gorgeous and awaken the senses. The incense note is smoky and luxurious, so much so that I am transported to a dark clay chamber where artists are painting hieroglyphs by the light of perfumed torches. Sur le Nil evokes citrus groves, a cornucopia of vegetables, something aquatic, and something smoky and mysterious. My god, some perfumes smell ""good"" and we attach personal significance to them because of this, that, and the other--BUT THIS ladies and gentlemen, transports you to a place with no time. What a pleasure, a treasure, and a masterpiece. Close your eyes and smell this. You have to at least once in your life.
For summer--summer all the way--and for those moments when you need a vacation but can't quite put your life on hold just yet."
Un Jardin Sur Le Nil Hermès (unisex) ~ 2005,"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'floral', 'fresh spicy', 'green', 'fruity', 'tropical', 'powdery', 'herbal', 'sweet']","The note list for Un Jardin Sur Le Nil is pretty unique, but honestly, I don't get a lot of the more interesting notes, though that could be due to me not really knowing what they smell like individually, so it's tough to pick them.

What I do get is a blast of grapefruit and mango in the opening that's very fresh and juicy. It's definitely the flesh of the fruit you get. The two together give an interesting mix of sweet and sour, with an almost plastic-y feel, though it's not at all unpleasant nor synthetic smelling. After these two dominating citruses relax, which takes about 30 minutes, the florals, noticeably the lotus and peony, peek through and a subtle floral sweetness flitters in and out of composition, which makes the whole thing smell very romantic and slightly mysterious. I'd say that ""romantic"" is the best word to sum this scent up for me. It does a fantastic job at conjuring up a romantic, secret garden vibe, with hints of rain and fresh vegetation. Overall I think it's a wonderful fragrance that's light, airy, fresh and slightly exotic. I wish the incense made a little more of an appearance, but you can't have it all I suppose.

The performance, as has been mentioned is poor, which is the scents biggest letdown. I get a big citrus for about 2 hours, then a soft, skin scent with the florals and the citrus taking more of a back seat for another couple of hours and then poof, it's gone.

For a refined, fresh day scent in spring/summer or a rainy day scent in the fall/winter, this is impeccable based purely on the smell though. One for the romantics and the dreamers. Despite its longevity issues, I can't help being in love with this. It's fragile, beautiful and unique enough to warrant a place on any shelf, male, female, young and old. Class as always from JCE."

I get grapefruit, mango, and lotus, nothing else. One question though - what, exactly, do bulrushes actually smell like? Because when I think of them, I think of marsh gasses, and this most definitely does not smell like that!
I thought Sur la Toit was my favorite Jardin, but Sur la Nil is giving that one some serious competition!"
Un Jardin Sur Le Nil Hermès (unisex) ~ 2005,"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'floral', 'fresh spicy', 'green', 'fruity', 'tropical', 'powdery', 'herbal', 'sweet']","A lot has been written about this scent – very few fragrances have had entire books written about their creation – but there are a few things that stand out about it and should be emphasized: for starters, no scent with as high of a commercial profile as UJSLN has plant elements this convincingly realistic-smelling. It was a stroke of brilliance to base the profile of a scent on the savory nature of vegetables rather than pulling the sweetness from fruit. As a result, UJSLN achieves an adult-style vision of freshness that exceeds the boundaries of only green plants and citruses. While the anchor is the much-mentioned green mango note, the presence of the tomato/tomato leaf and carrots balances the scent in a mature direction while not threatening its lightness and fresh character. While marketed primarily for women, Un Jardin Sur Le Nil is unisex in a way that puts it outside the frameworks of gender altogether due to its vegetal and botanical sensibilities.

The performance is the weak link here and is as fleeting as its reputation dictates but there is one way to get around it: spray it on clothing. For a scent as complex as UJSLN it does end up playing out in a linear way both on skin and on fabrics. Spray it on your sleeves or collar to keep it around longer and the projection is respectable this way also."

Although other people say it smells like a garden, that isn't really the case for me as I smell mainly sweet citruses, particularly a strong and realistic orange note (which makes the whole thing smell similar to Atelier Cologne's Orange Sanguine in my opinion). I do smell the mango in this, but I think Polo Black has a better take on mango (Polo Black has salted mangos while this has the sweet kind). There is a hint of a sweet fig note in the background as well, along with a very mild hint of green notes. But it isn't green enough to smell like a garden in my opinion. I also don't detect the garden note of carrot much (although maybe I do but haven't been able to detect its aroma). There is a slight aquatic vibe underneath the whole thing as well. Overall it's nice with subtle sillage and ok longevity in the summer, but isn't as green as I'd like and leans a bit feminine.

I'm very surprised that this doesn't get compared to the mighty Timbuktu. Though while L'Artisan's cult classic embraces everything heady and ceremonial, Sur Le Nil abandons all that in favor of a more rained out, vegetal approach. Mango and grapefruit start the party, but it's a green, unripe mango that is more bitter than it is sweet. A gentle incense drifts in the background, and as the name implies: it's all very garden like. Whenever I try Ellena's work I'm always immediately reminded of one specific thing: water ripples. Sur Le Nil is no exception. The scent is every bit as wet and cleansing as you'd expect from something inspired by a river. Heat and humidity will accompany this one well. A masterful summer fragrance and one that is truly unisex. There's a hint of carrot and tomato that can be a little weird from time to time, but overall it's a winner in my book."

Un Jardin Sir li nil is a very sharp,green,citrusy scent that has some sweetness and an aromatic nature from melon and a nice incense vibe in the background making this a very interesting scent ! I did really enjoy this when I smelled it in the air but for some reason this type of scent just doesn’t go well with my personality and if honestly only wear this if I was on vacation in a tropical setting.

Performance on this is great for a freshie and lasts 6-10 hours and projects very well !

Overall rating-6.5 great scent but it’s not appealing to me or others (fiancée said it was too sharp)"
Un Jardin Sur Le Nil Hermès (unisex) ~ 2005,"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'floral', 'fresh spicy', 'green', 'fruity', 'tropical', 'powdery', 'herbal', 'sweet']","What can I say about the scent that is not already said by its name? This smells like a spring/summer garden breeze. A gorgeous mix of freshly cut grass (probably the tomato leaf), mixed flowers and fresh vegetables/fruit . It truly smells like a garden. I could probably count the perfumes I've encountered that has actually succeeded with that on one hand. I'm truly impressed!

So what's the main drawback? Exactly the same as the aforementioned strengths. If everyone wanted to smell like a garden, this wouldn't be a unique scent. While I enjoy the life-like carrot-, grapefruit-, and tomato-notes, I think many others will dislike the idea of smelling like food and random plants. The magic of this lies in its ability to awaken memories from gardens and happy moments. I'm not sure the experience would be quite the same for someone who associates these smells to a refrigerator or the produce section of a supermarket.

On me personally, this lasts for a long time, but stays discrete and close to the skin throughout the wear. I find that ideal.

Being Hermes, it is very expensive. But it is also well crafted and hard to find a cheaper replacement for. I think we look for different things in perfumes. This might not be for those looking for just any perfume that smells nice, but rather for those who want a very specific and unique perfume. Personally, I'm not sure this is worth the price for me.

SUMMARY: This is a true garden scent, that will probably appeal to a specific audience rather than to ""everyone"". It is unique and can thus be found very strange by some. Among vegetable garden scents, it's so well crafted it might be without rival."

During the 2nd and 3rd tries, the vegetal notes started to seem far more prominent than I first noticed. They're interesting, and nicely done, but vegies aren't for me when it comes to perfume. I could clearly smell them as carrot and tomato, rather than just amorphic vegetal notes. Could have been the power of suggestion, but for whatever reason, they jumped out at me and they didn't sit well. I must admit I only noticed the vegies that strongly when the fragrance was radiating off my skin in very hot weather. But since that's exactly the kind of weather I'd be looking to wear a light citrus floral such as this, that's not much good for me.

I did like the fresh citrus element however. The grapefruit is nice, smooth and refreshing. Not like the chemical nose-jarring blast you get from some perfumes that have grapefruit."

On first sniff, I get fresh, citrus but sweet. It's not bitter/sour like a lot of citrus openings. It's more tangerine, mandarin, and orange than lime/lemon. Sweet but not crazy, still very citrusy. At the same time, it smells very green, like freshly cut grass or grass after a heavy rainfall. It's earthy and fresh at the same time.

As it dries down, I get a stronger fruity note, and it becomes too difficult to pick out exactly what it smells like. It reminds me of Sunny D but fancy--orangey sweet but there's something about it that makes it lean more mimosa. It's absolutely beautiful but becomes a very faint skin scent after 3-4 hours.

It almost doesn't smell like perfume; that's how natural this smells. It's absolutely beautiful and I see it as more feminine than unisex. Quite a shame that it doesn't last long."

Nil withstands humidity very well too.

My only qualification is that on me Nil is rather linear once the initial notes settle. I tend to lose interest in it.

Un Jardin sur le Nil opens with a bite of fresh, green citrus, then mellows into a gentle lotus scent for the remainder of the wear time. This reminds me so much of a water lily or lotus fragrance I’ve smelled before, but the memory is so faint that it seems to be from another lifetime; quite a dreamy moment for me. Also, I must say, I am SHOCKED this was created in 2005! It feels like it would’ve been a cornerstone fragrance for this brand and would’ve been around since Hermès’ beginning. And a quick note of praise to the print ads for this fragrance – I don’t think I’ve ever seen a fragrance visually described so perfectly. The peaceful lily sitting on a pond of gently rippling water on a quiet, overcast day … that IS this perfume.

My only disappointment is that I can’t pick up on the complexity suggested by the note composition. I only get citrus and lotus, with maybe the slightest hint of carrot. I wish I could smell the musk, incense, and cinnamon mingle with the florals; that would’ve been an interesting combination to experience! Maybe, though, the supporting notes melt into the florals so well that they don’t take away from the softness of the fragrance. Maybe this perfume is just THAT well-blended.

Super soft sillage but moderate longevity.

A few weeks back he used it and I liked the smell, so yesterday we did a test, we used it at the same time, Again on me after 2 minutes a real rotten stinker,n him a very good fresh scent that stayed... It is a unisex scent but on my female skin a bad stinker, on my partners skin a pleasant good scent...so it remains his...."
Un Jardin Sur Le Nil Hermès (unisex) ~ 2005,"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'floral', 'fresh spicy', 'green', 'fruity', 'tropical', 'powdery', 'herbal', 'sweet']","I have never been a fan of citrus-based perfumes. To me, they can either be too astringent or too close to house cleaning products, but the minute I smelled Un Jardin Sur Le Nil I fell in love. The grapefruit is vibrant and sparkling, but the watery lotus mellows the grapefruit enough to keep it from becoming astringent. Then the iris unfolds into a light powdery aroma, while the incense and cinnamon keep the scent grounded. On me, I never get the smell of tomatoes or carrot, just an uplifting citrus-floral. I wear this on rainy days when the freshness of the air just makes this scent intoxicatingly gorgeous. As long as Hermes keeps making Un Jardin Sur Le Nil I will keep this in my perfume collection."

I own a small sample bottle gifted to me along with three other Hermes scents. The notes intrigued me so I was eager to try it first. So interesting, fresh, and natural. Expensive but the best art is. This is a crafted perfume meant to take you on a journey. On my skin there's a fresh combination of carrot, tomato, mango and grapefruit. Don't be put off by the unique combo - the notes reveal themselves in such an elegant composition. Not like anything else you'll try. It's not my everyday feminine gourmand but it brightens up my world every time I wear it. I'd say it's definitely unisex, which makes it less of a go to scent for me, but it's worth the experience.

I would not have even known about this had I not randomly inherited a book called "" The Perfect Scent: A Year Inside the Perfume Industry in Paris and New York"" by Chandler Burr.
Great book! It's the story of how this scent was created while at the same time, SJP was having her ""Lovely"" scent created by Coty. Some fun here!
Anyway, this perfume is complex and intriguing. So many notes, my oh my.
You can let your imagination run wild while you drink in the swirling blend of all the scents you thought you'd never imagine loving in a perfume and somehow you sniff yourself ragged trying to get them all in.
Tomato?? Come on in. Carrot? Sit right down. Mango...ahhhh mango. Come settle in here. Am I getting healthier just sniffing you guys?The rest of you? You have a place at my table!


This is a masterpiece. Fabulous sillage, lovely longevity.

Very citrusy and uplifting in the beginning, but once it settles down, I get some earthyness mixed with bulrush and lotus leaves (even if lotus leaves are not in the note breakdown).

Do sample it, I am certain that once the sample is done you will want a whole bottle."

Fresh, fruity and delicate. Not scandalous and smells more far than excpected. Oneself can be in acquitance easily but others get the essence. People who did not smelled before are curious about it. You will be asked what is it.

Expensive and original, but truly is a great investment for your originality and your pleasure.

Their freshness makes you do not feel tired of the smell. Can be used in the morning or at noon, even afternoon. The sillage keeeps for longer than expected.

Ideal for those who love green and fresh aromas."
Un Jardin Sur Le Nil Hermès (unisex) ~ 2005,"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'floral', 'fresh spicy', 'green', 'fruity', 'tropical', 'powdery', 'herbal', 'sweet']","I first smelled this scent 5 years ago on my way back home from the Philippines, stopping by Taiwan Airport first.

I had just finished my 1 week visit and funeral in Manila.
It was an emotional time for me, because my 1st wife just died from cancer.

As I was walking along the airport terminal,
I looked up and saw this green transparent bottle from the House of Hermes.
I had heard of them before from Youtubers and thought I give it a try with their tester.
I sprayed only one spritz on my wrist after a nice smell from the bottle itself.

After walking away for a few minutes, I stopped and asked myself,
""What is that smell?? Who just walked by me?""
I had just walked by a lady whom I thought had on this nice, elegant, unique, classy, and refreshing scent.

I kept on walking, and realized that this scent followed me.
I stopped again and asked, ""Where is that smell coming from? Wait, it can't be that Hermes that I just sprayed on my wrist.""

I lifted up my dead arm to smell my wrist.
Sure enough, that smell was me! I couldn't believe it! How can a fragrance give off this type of aroma? It completely changed in smell after just 30 mins.

I kept smelling it, as it uplifted my spirit from a very down and emotional one.

Un Jardin Sur Le Nil put a smile on my face.
I'm not saying this is the best fragrance I've ever had or smelled, but it darn sure is one of the most unique ones ever.

It was this fragrance that made me realize that a smell can really change a person's mood.
From an emotional or down one, to a uplifted spirit.
A sad face to a smiley face...

After finding out about the book, ""The Perfect Scent"" I then realized how much work was put into this fragrance.

The House of Hermes created a winner. There's no such thing as a perfect scent, but they are close and
have been creating fragrances for more than a century.

I didn't have the money at the time to buy a bottle, because it was $100+.

I knew that I had to have one someday when the money is there and there's a good deal going.

However, buyers BEWARE: if it's a limited edition or they decide to discontinue it, prices will skyrocket.

I found it this past week online (authentic), for more than half the price.

I had no clue what was in the notes when I first smelled it, but after looking it up on fragrantica, I can see where it all comes from.

Depending on the climate, this frag changes in different directions. With that being said, it may not be for everyone.

If you're a simplistic type of person, then this is NOT for you.
If you love adventure and love trying new things, this is for you.
If you love different things and consider yourself different or want to be different from others, this is for you.

It transcends gender in a way that only beauty can. The moment you try to describe it, it becomes less than what it is. This is something where the whole is so much more than the sum of its parts. Where every note is beautifully smooth and balanced. In short, a bottle of Zen.

This is my best fragrance when I am moving about in the oppressive humidity of South East Asia. It's also my default olfactory pick me up when the heat becomes overly sticky and I need to lift my spirits. This is beautifully suited for taking tea on the terrace of the Mandarin Oriental and would also be my first choice visiting a forgotten temple on the banks of a river.

you can guess from this name that it is floral like. Yes! it is...
Mr Ellena created a perfume that you can't detect any notes separately. We are faced to an accord.
I could detect only lotus flower in notes, but it is too opaque.

The opening gives the impression the room just got brighter. After that it remains dominated by grapefruit, slightly over-pushing the grapefruit note to the point where it compromises the sense of a 'blend', the feeling of composition, and risks smelling cheap. Projection is very good. It really does evoke the feeling of a cool breeze over an expanse of water coloured by tropical fruits and grasses. However, a little bit in the posh handsoap/air freshener category rather than fragrance. As something to enhance an airy summer's day it would go very well."

For a perfume, Bizarre but in a good way. Man I m loving it, fresh, clean, safe, soft and strangely, smells expensive too. Indeed a uni, but there are times the scent leans a little feminine I guess the lotus/peony/iris plays a part here, but then the musk n woods stepped out as to remind there's a man in the house too.

Somehow there is some sweetness that add joyful feeling in these masterpiece.

So, I kept my eyes peeled for a good sale somewhere and finally purchased it a couple of months ago.

Although I’ve never been anywhere near the Nile, I’ve been around plenty of rivers, lakes and lily ponds, and this fragrance really does evoke that kind of environment for me: watery, green, earthy, and floral with some organic matter underneath. Oddly, although most reviewers have voted for a dominant grapefruit note, this is barely noticeable on me except as a trace of bitterness. For the most part, this is so smooth that I don’t pick up individual notes very much.

It’s winter here now and I’ve been enjoying wearing this, but have the feeling that UN JARDIN SUR LE NIL will be at its best for me in spring and summer as the scent seemed even more rich when I happened to be in an over-heated room for awhile.

Reviews are divided as to whether or not this fragrance is unisex as marketed or if it’s actually more feminine. Per the statistically small sample of my husband and me, this is a unisex scent, although he’s not that much into green scents on himself. He does like it on me. Sillage is on the low end of moderate and the longevity on me is excellent, but this seems to vary significantly according to personal chemistry. In fact, it’s clear that personal chemistry plays a big role with this one in general, so blind buys might not be a safe option."

Un Jardin Sur Le Nil Hermès (unisex) ~ 2005,"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'floral', 'fresh spicy', 'green', 'fruity', 'tropical', 'powdery', 'herbal', 'sweet']","Extremely fresh opening, and that's a good thing. Orange, a sweet mango and a grapefruit lingering in the background. Yes, beautiful. Then a green note and, wait, it's the carrot! brings the whole composition together.
I've never been in Egypt or Sudan but I love to dream that I'm on a boat with the bright sun on a blue sky and the air is filled with this scents. I know, the reality is different but Thats the magic of scents. They can take you to a far away land were you have never been before.
Un jardin Sur le Nil is delicate, juicy, quiet, understated and wonderful.
It starts with fleshy, juicy elements and finish with dry, herbaceous notes. The ride is over, time to go back to reality."

Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Purchased the bell jar several years ago. It’s quite powdery on me tho lots of Amber, hay and honey keep it from smelling like baby powder. I get an almond/myrrh blend that smells like amaretto or brandied cherries. And I concur with the reviewer who said it's a linear scent--smells pretty much the same on me from the moment I put it on until it dies away several hours later. Definitely an intimate fragrance even in the bell jar formulation. I wear it to bed mostly although under a sweater in autumn is very sexy."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Oriental, sweet, smokey and powdery. Smells like classy autumn evening. Heavy for the day or sunny days unless you are living in Middle East. Unisex. Nice, but nothing so special."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Smells like baby powder without a massive tobacco punch to me. In the vein of Versace the Dreamer in some ways, but even more floral powder. Have tried several times to like this scent, but just not my thing."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","One caveat to not having children is that I don’t associate this scent with baby wipes. Instead I smell a gorgeous floral powder. I’m not sure there is development or transitions, what you get in the beginning doesn’t change, only growing softer over time.

I’m picking up honeyed almonds though not listed—might be the tobacco and hay note causing that affect. Everything else is smooth, well blended and works harmoniously. This does not project and I’m happy about that as I can see this might be off putting to some folks.

I’m sampling from a decant vial and I really wish I could spray it. This scent seems to have good lasting power just the same.

My husband likes Chergui though he thinks it smells a tad dated (a polite way of saying it’s for older people). I guess that means I’m an old lady because if I’m lucky, and I come across a gently used bottle (I hate the new labels), I would not hesitate to purchase this wonderful creation."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","This smells like an October scent. It's perfect; I spend time out on my friends cattle farm, and this is definitely a scent for me. It has a dirty powdery scent that I love and the hay scent brings back amazing memories. This scent I would not be best for a date night outside of a farm to me(IMHO)!! But this scent is definitely a personal scent, and casual. I don't believe this will be a HUGE crowd pleaser, the wearer TRULY has to love the scent. I'll be searching for a bottle soon."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","I bought a travel size and the opening was nice. Kind of spicy and slightly sweet, but nothing that wows me. The dry down is baby powder. I still smell it on the shirt in my hamper from two days ago. Just baby powder. So far the only Serge Lutens I liked enough to buy FB’s are La Vierge De Fer and Datura Noir. I haven’t tried them all. Will use up my decants of L’Orpheline and Vetiver Oriental. They are nice too."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Incredible, amazing, a total must have ! I get compliments every time and I love smelling this on myself."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Dirty, nasty. I dont know how else to describe this hay beauty. There is something damp earthy dirty in it, that I gravitate to. 10/10"
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Uncle Serge! This Smells like A Candle MAN!

I Mean i had a massive thing for tobacco fragrances few years ago! When i tried this, i was like is this a Candle?

This is such a linear fragrance man! It goes nowhere! Its like a Reisinous christmas Candle.

I Respect the people that love this and im not here to start beefin! 5/10!"
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']",So glad I only got a decant of this. This smells like lightly spiced baby powder (or those wet wipes that clog the plumbing?) on my skin. The SL house must just not be for me. Stupid skin chemistry...Off to pout.
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","For me this is another disappointment by this house!
Notes are promising but the scent did not work for me at all.
I find it overly sweet and cloying honeyed tobacco.
I don't get what everyone else is talking about, overrated frag in my opinion.
Serge Lutens creations are just not for me, way too challenging, way too bizarre, to the point where it becomes unwearable, unenjoyable."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Oh, dear. Wanted to love this (those notes are everything I adore!) but unfortunately, I don’t think it agrees with my chemistry. This was so fusty and old ladyish on me :(

The dry down is lovely (though very, very quiet) now, several hours on — cozy wood, chai spice, and amber. But the initial two hours were simply a cloud of outdated powder and spice, and by the time that had passed, easily 70% of the fragrance was gone.

Hope it pulls better on your skin — and with such wide acclaim, there’s no reason to expect it shouldn’t."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Chergui is one of the best dry down that I've ever smell. Spicy dry tobacco mix with hey in opening and dry down is very seductive. Nice blended sweet amber rose and tobacco mixed together almost perfect. This is one my cup of tea.

Scent : 4.5/5
Longevity : 4/5
Projection : 4/5"
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","I’m so sad. I have a 5ml decant from a friends full bottle... this smells nothing like everyone is raving about (on my skin). I could cry... I get a soapy, powdery bleh... I want the Halloween hay ride near the honey bee farm and campfires and a fancy suede jacket (as mentioned below)!
I’ll try again tomorrow...
Edit: 4/21- the opening is beautiful. The drydown is still too powdery for me."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']",I definitely should not have sprayed this on myself on a hot sunny day; this is not the mood! I want to revisit this scent when it's cooler though. I mainly get sweet unburnt tobacco and sweet unburnt pontifical incense resins. It's the scent of unburnt things-to-be-burnt? Very cozy.

Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Christopher Sheldrake's line for Serge Lutens seems to be an object of fascination for fragrance enthusiasts because they are so unapologetically ""perfumey""--almost nothing of his I've smelled would be anything you'd want to wear for the office because they are so intense. This is one of his famous scents: a smooth mixture of tobacco, hay, and honey, mixed with iris, that somehow comes off smelling wonderfully like cherry cordial.

Its sillage is not powerful, which is a good thing, because otherwise it would be much too much (like Baccarat 450, which is slightly resembles, though this is not nearly as cloying). Instead, this is like a nice secret that stays close to the skin, and would probably be much treasured in an intimate relationship by a partner. Like all Lutens fragrances I've smelled, it does require confidence to pull it off because of its boldness."

ON A SUMMER'S DAY - CIRCRA 1800's FRANCE

Seductive smooth honey butter -

Chergui is personal this is not a crown pleaser, at least not for me - I wear this for myself - it's intimate it's romantic it's magical it's seductive."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Ok - hear me out.
The night before, on a warmer October evening/night, you spent the night at a haunted hay ride, close by to a honey bee farm. You were wearing your favourite suede jacket. You come home, not noticing your jacket smells lightly like smoke, hay, honey, a gentle warmth.
The next day, you put the jacket back on, you step outside. Big inhale. You're hit with the first morning where you can see your breath of the year, mixed with the coolness of frost on the dying grass.
BAM - you've met Chergui. This starts off with a cool smoky tobacco warmth mixed with hay/dead cold grass. Then, it heats up on the skin, out comes the honey and ambery notes. On the dry down, I get the slightest bit of floral (rose and iris) that smells like the perfume you were wearing the night before that is on its last hour.
This is gorgeous - absolutely unisex and very layered.

Longevity is moderate for me 5-6 hours on the skin, lasts forever on clothing. I really like spraying this on warm sweaters or blankets to cuddle up with on a cold night. Silage is moderate, arm's length but still nice.

Overall 8/10, not a scent I reach for all the time but when I'm in the mood for this, this is all I wear."

Reminds me to The Dreamer, which I also like a lot, but Chergui is so much smoother. I mostly get the tobacco and hay, with a bit of powder given by the iris and sandal, but everything is there, blended to deliciousness, the honey and amber adds just enough sweetness to balance it out to perfection. So smooth, nothing sticks out."

Mind you, I am not a fan of overly sweet perfumes.... but Chergui seduces you.
Honey, tobacco (but very mild) a fresh sauge, juniper and other balsamic resins; leather.... give way to a majestc moroccoan rose and iris. Spices and mystery.
All the above sits onto an ambery/incense/clean musk base.
Very seducing. Stays with you and comforts you all day (or night) long, like cashmere pullover.
Like the hot oriental wind it borrows the name from (and oriental winds can be very *hot*), it can drag you into paths you'd never thought about. Dangerous!
A must have; one of my top five fragrances for life."

It's perhaps better suited to the types of events where you'll spend a fair amount of time with someone, because impressionistically it's not as impressive to me. I'm on the fence as far as immediacy, and intrigued by its evolution. A bit floral, hay-like, honey sweetened, tart tabacco. I would probably prefer a decant, because I dont see myself wearing this very often, but I do see myself appreciating it for the right event. 8/10"
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Picked up a sample of this and threw it on right before I walked my dogs on a beautiful 70°F Los Angeles day. Opened up a little to my surprise, almost reminding me of ADP Colonia Oud, but that could just be my sniffer playing tricks on me. As I walked, it starting quickly drying down into a delicious, honey tobacco as the listed notes would suggest ... but there’s depth to it. I get just a bit of baby powder on opening, but it burns off pretty quickly and then it’s hardly a powdery scent. It’s quite enjoyable and perfectly unisex with wafts lifting nicely off my skin and floating up to my nose all along my walk. As very, very nice as this is, I won’t be picking it up for myself, but if it were gifted to me I’d be thrilled to add it to the gang. I will say this: as I mentioned, I tried this on a lightly warm day and I think it excelled; it was never cloying or offensive even as I worked up a minor sweat. Wouldn’t recommend it for summer, but I actually really like this for springtime and of course it would shine in fall & winter. Great fragrance. 8.5/10

Edit: As this wears on, I continue to get the most warm and pleasant aroma filled breezes. It’s really making a compelling case for me to pick up a bottle.

Edit again 3/9/21: Just received full bottle as I couldn’t resist. The powder seems to hang around longer than I remember from my sample, but it’s none less fantastic.

Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","I love this. I was looking for an elegant tobacco with unisex sweetness and this is my favorite so far. I will admit to liking Tobacco Vanille, and the knock off from Zara, and I liked Tabac rouge (didn't love) - but Chergui is superior to all. It wears much better on me. I didn't like Spicebomb, Havane or 1821 tobacco scents - that's to give you an idea where I am coming from. So when I smelled Chergui, and smelled again it after an hour or so of wearing - I was in love. It goes on perfectly, dries down perfectly.
I got a sample, and now I will buy a bottle.
More unisex than TV, and more interesting and complex smelling too. There is a sweet tobacco, not too much honey, no leather, some vanilla, and something else interesting and perhaps floral? Just a tiny bit. It works.
Totally worth it.
It also makes me want to try a Serge Luten's discovery set if they have one. Love love!"

It's blended so well with the amber, it almost gives everything a rounded powdery edge. Very nice opening in this, I was afraid the hay note would take over, but it sits in the bottom very nicely.

Rich, dark, and quite thick this one is. Definitely one for the cooler months, but I'm not sure I have any room for another tobacco scent in my little collection. This one leans a little feminine on my skin as well due to the powderiness.

This is my first experience with the house and I am surprised how much I enjoy this one. Somehow it kind of reminds me of a cherry almond lotion but has depth to it."

It's not an understatement; when I wear this you can actually feel the heat radiating from my wrist. Chergui is a moderately heavy, warm and sweet spicy amber with incense and very mild tobacco & cinnamon notes. This is a classy, perfectly blended, grown-up, intelligent winter perfume and while it is mature and feminine, this could easily be unisex. Takes me away to somewhere deep, dark & interesting in a small tucked away place in Cuba. A very good fragrance that is different to mass market ones and despite its heavy sillage and incredible longevity it is never cloying. A little goes a long way; I have the ''dab on'' bottle not a spray, which is far better for this perfume. Obsession for grown ups."

It definitely leans more feminine because of how sugary/sweet it is. I don't wear it much. I was hoping for more tobacco.
I wouldn't want my wife to wear it either because it would be a stuffy old lady scent on a woman in my opinion.

Buy a sample and test it. I think it's a stretch for a man or a woman to wear. Again, it DOES smell good, but not as a personal scent. Maybe a winter/cozy candle scent?"

Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Chergui’s core notes are dark tobacco; dense, sticky honey; and funky, plant-ish hay. It's cozy and rich, yet a little rakish, too.

There’s a kind of duality to Chergui: The tobacco and incense pull dark, dry, and serious, while the honey and hay have a sweet, vital, almost chewy moistness to them.

About two-thirds of Chergui is springy and sweetly mentholated, and makes me think of a rural middle-school kid on their first day of vacation, happy and energetic, at play in the field near the barn. But there’s another aspect of Chergui that’s darker, and a bit smoldering: a restless farm-hand working on a pack of chewing tobacco and playing solitaire late into the night. He’s got a copy of Leaves Of Grass in his rucksack with his high school sweetheart’s picture tucked in the pages.

(Despite the image I'm painting, Chergui is more unisex than you would think. I find it beautifully tomboyish on myself, and wear it with relish.)"

I was nervous because I read of it smelling of baby powder. I got that vibe but only for about 5 minutes so the haters definitely did not wear this perfume more than 5 minutes. It very quickly fades to something more smoky and sensual yet soft as it simply melts into your skin. There are so many poetic reviews because of the complexity of the fragrance. It's ""not too"" anything which makes it hard to place - not too sweet, not too tobacco, not too honey like, not too spicy, not too feminine, not too masculine, etc. The poetic experience for me personally is that Chergui brought me to sitting by a campfire. It's as if campfire scent is mixing with a fresh clean soapy smell and there is raw honeycomb nearby. By the time the perfume reaches the base notes I can't describe it as anything other than it smells like a nice warm hug LOL! For years I've worn Coco Madamoiselle and was more than ready for a change. At the very least I found a new winter/fall fragrance. I'm so glad I bought it and tried something new!"

The tobacco here is a raw one, and combined with hay, it creates a very unique feel, as if we are in a tobacco plant field. Honey and amber adding sweetness to the concoction, just about enough to bring this perfume from the masculine territory to the unisex realm.

I can't stop sniffing my wrists wearing this hahahaha.... It projects moderately with good longevity. De Marly's Herod might be a better option than Chergui if you are looking for a heavy tobacco scented fragrance. Chergui is not so much about the tobacco, but the mix of the tobacco, hay, amber, and honey. Dusita Issara has the same vibe as Chergui, but both equally beautiful."

Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","My batch is from February 2020. Upon initial spray, it instantly reminded me of Bvlgari Black, which I also own. It doesn't have its tea notes, but it has that plasticky-rubbery smell; it could be a flanker for Bvlgari Black. The DNA in the opening is very similar.

Chergui is a nice smell. It has other notes blended in, and yes, it's blended masterfully, with nothing clashing or sticking out, but overall, my brain detects the scent of baby wipes at first. I used to own Black is Black Modern Oud, and it also had that baby wipe-like smell.

After 20-30 minutes, Chergui starts smelling leathery like Ferrari Uomo, which I own, and also reminding me of the new leather notes of...more oud fragrances again...Ferrari Essence Oud, which I used to own. It also has a similar rose note to the one in Franck Olivier Oud Touch and also Perry Ellis Black Vanilla Absolute.

Just two sprays on my skin project nicely and get stronger by the minute. It's not a fragrance bomb, but for being such a delicate, smooth and harmless fragrance, people will definitely notice this scent in your personal bubble. It's not perfumey or cologney like your typical department store fragrances, so it's in my opinion very safe to use anywhere.

If you're super picky or not too adventurous, do get a sample first before you buy a full bottle, because ir's not cheap, and I can see someone not being super thrilled about it. It warrants careful olfactory exploration. Give it a chance if you do buy it. I wasn't thrilled by it at first, but the more I sniffed it on me, the more I got why people fall so deeply in love with it. It's just a classy, cozy fragrance.

If Chergui was a human, to me it would be a reassuring brain or heart surgeon, or a courageous firefighter or EMT. ☺️

Sure, it has tobacco in it. It has Iris in it and warm sun-sweetened hay, as well. It’s dusty and sweet, sun-scorched but cooling, like a cold breeze through the middle of a desert. Once you know the combination, all the notes balancing harmoniously in a cloud around you, it only smells like one thing: Chergui.

If you’re looking for a straight tobacco scent, there are more realistic choices: dirty tobacco and sweet tobacco and spiced tobacco. Slumberhouse and Hiram Green and Ensar Oud and Sultan Pasha all do better Tobacco scents. No one does a better Chergui.

I have had a lot of time with this and my impressions of the fragrance have not really changed in the sense I think its a wonderful fragrance that smells warm and comforting with great longevity and I do love it.
However, after trying a few other tobacco frags such as Naxos, Pure Havanne, Tobacco Reserve Aramis and recently Volutes Diptyque EDP, I find that the tobacco accord in this is far too weak for me. Personally I prefer a more masculine gentlemen like tobacco scent with the right balance of sweetness so I do now prefer Tobacco Reserve and Volutes and if I had the spare coin I would buy Naxos, just my personal preference thats all.
Chergui has a lot going on with it the start is rather intense and in the dry down I do find it rather sweet with that honey and powdery iris, but if you're after a sweet tobacco scent thats not too full on in your face e.g. Pure Havanne or Tobacco Vanille, than I would definitely recommend this! it is far more interesting and unique than the latter two."

You can not take it any further than this. Serge Lutens Chergui is a truly fine work of art, i must say. Yes, you have read all the reviews before, there is little i can add. But let me state this:
The opening is heavy on tobacco, the dry down is tobacco/amber/hay. It´s all blended into something universal, something you will keep close to yourself for the rest of your life, once you have smelled it.
Tobacco, to me, is leaning more masculine than the opposite. That doesn´t mean that a woman should not wear this scent, not at all. But the tobacco-note is a hard hitter and you need to appreciate that, be aware. There is no escape in this frag!

One more thing: I strongly advice you to get your hands on one of the (discontinued) old 50 ml bottles. They are so much more fashion than the new bottles. The juice might be the same - the fashion is not.

But in the end. You know the cliché: If you only should try one tobacco-frag....this is the one.

Projection: moderate.
Longivety: 6 hours.

Prodding at something familiar and old, something deeply formative but totally unplaceable. I've only experienced this deep-but-unidentifiable nostalgia response to perfume a couple of times.

Aside from that, it's also just a beautiful and delicious fragrance. Smooth, sweet, delicate, strong, present, perfect. It's well-balanced, well-blended, and simply gorgeous.

Chergui is so compelling and deeply libidinal, it's almost unnerving. I'm so glad I found it. The hype is real."

It's weirdly minty to my nose, and the opening reminds me of a kid's sweet mint toothpaste I used to use when I was maybe 5 years old!
After a while the mint-like notes settles down and I instead get some rose and a lot of great dry pipe tobacco, a smell I love. Unfortunately, this amazing scent is buried underneath a very sweet honey accord that gives me a headache and an amber that I'm not a big fan of either... I wanted this to be a dry, dark tobacco but instead it's a sugary sweet powdery tobacco (like a lot of tobacco scents nowadays unfortunately are).

Definitely not for me but for the people who love honey & tobacco combos and want something a bit more interesting than the usual stuff, this is for you.

This is one of them. I would say that I couldn't ever really see myself wearing this, but there are few fragrances that so vividly invoke a certain scene or mood. ""By the Fireplace"" is a great example, and you can guess why. ""Vetiver"" by Guerlain is another good one personally, because it reminds me of when my dad would drag me along to his tennis matches when I was a kid. Tennis balls, sweat, and white t-shirts.

This fragrance drags me to a wheat field in autumn, next to a big dilapidated barn. It hits you with a very dry, warm 'hay' accord, which eventually dies down into a slightly sweet, smooth and warm honey tobacco. It's an incredible scent, one that I definitely wouldn't mind at all as a candle, but definitely not one I can wear. Most definitely worth a try."

I have been meaning to test it for a while and I finally got around to it as it is certainly not on the hype train.
It has literally blown me away and I cannot understand why more people do not rave about this on their Autumn/ fall winter rotation this year.

I must admit it does smell rather different on skin than paper which is probably why the rating is not as high as I thought it would be. But my lord what a fragrance!

My rotation will be, Dior Homme Intense, Rochas Moustache, l'Instant de Guerlain Pour Homme EDP, this is Him Zadig and Voltaire, Encre Noir A l' extreme and of course Chergi!
The only downside of this fragrance for some people is, it is not that versatile. But if you are smelling this chances are you have collection of fragrances already for every occasion! Just enjoy it :)
Edit: Actually on second thoughts I find this versatile I could wear this for most occasions, its not a date night scent as it does not project enough. But it is just perfect for a cold day and makes you feel all warm inside every-time you sniff it."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Oh...wow. I put two dabs on each wrist and immediately heard Jim Morrison crooning in my head. (""Well, show me the way, to the next whiskey bar...."") I looked at my Doc Martens moto boots in the corner...not the black ones, the brown ones...and wanted to put them on with the dark brown riding jacket from Westley Richards that my beloved Mate surprised me with a few years ago. Timeless. Classic. This is a perfect companion for walking in the chill of Fall. For going to a high-end whiskey bar, one that has a giant stone fireplace with the fire going steadily because it is cold outside. Chergui would be at home sitting at that fireplace, watching the firelight play over a snifter of high-end bourbon, smelling the tobacco of an expensive cigar or pipe to the left of you, while to your right you can faintly overhear Sherlock Holmes and John Watson arguing about something. For me, so far, Chergui evokes more of a feeling and conjures images that are more than the sum of its notes. Yes, I can smell the tobacco, the sweetness that I assume is honey (but is so well-blended it doesn't smell like any honey I've ever smelled in a perfume), the smokey note that drifts under the tobacco and sweetness, and the fleeting powdery-ness that drifts past occasionally, almost like someone opened the door and a faint bit of the cold outside made its way to the fireplace. I understand now why this is one of SL's most beloved and well-known fragrances."

I love how the cacophonous, spice-laden opening settles into the most beautiful sugared hay atop an amber base. I will always have this in my collection. Yes, it's changed over time. The original bell jar I received of this had a certain three dimensionality, chewiness, and heft to its sweet hay chord. I'd say now it's a bit more vaguely ambery with a whisper of that hay, but still lovely nonetheless, and ultimately produces the same effect. The ""morning after"" Chergui--a lingering breath of coumarin and spice--is my favorite part of the scent and all versions of it from oldest to newest have provided that sensation."

It's honey alright, but not super sweet to my nose, which is great because ultra-sweet honeys tend to make me sick! I just got a new bottle of this and it's just barely sweet, which is interesting because I sniffed it back in 2018 as well and all I could smell was a very animalic, very sweet honey-oud scent (like pee! and it also oddly reminded me of Oud Bouquet without pralines...) The tobacco is very forward on this one and I think it's being amplified by the hay note.

I like my new bottle, though, it's a real powerhouse and quite bitter on me. Earthy, elegant, but makes a statement. I'll definitely be wearing this in the fall alone or layering it with something sweet and fresh to brighten it up."

I can't remember such intense flowers marrying so well together in a perfume! They are the absolute stars of the fragrance. The notes-voting of Fragrantica are extremely illusive in this one, as tobacco and honey are only here to assist the star pair and give the fragrance its oriental character (SL dna), also laying a sweet but light and smooth background that in no way tries to ""steal the spotlight"" of the aforementioned stellar duo. I feel clear, in third place in prominence, the very lively and natural green freshness of the very interesting and different hay. To top it off, all the aroma is heavily greased by amber along with a silky and slightly animalic but subtle musk. Performance: projects nicely for 2hs or so, sitting close to skin for just another 3hs or so - not very good longevity."

There is really nothing like it , it wears absolutely beautifully and lasts forever. I always get complimented when I wear this. This is so sweet and jammy with a powdery sillage. It's very hard to pinpoint a single note but together they are fantastic."

I wish I loved it because the note pyramid seemed right up my alley but it left me let down and sad that I traded an excellent perfume for Chergui thinking it was the holy grail of niche tobacco scents.

Edit

After some consideration I’m wondering if I’m anosmic to whatever Tobacco aromachemical they use in this because I get none of the syrupy, golden honeyed pipe tobacco people keep talking about. It’s dry, not very sweet at all, extremely powdery and mostly more powder. Anyone else experience this?"

I am testing it at home in the middle of a heat wave, and it's making me long for the pleasures of fall. Warm, spicy, earthy, comforting, and sweet without veering into cloying, gourmand territory. I am guessing this is a scent aimed at men, but I'd say it's a true unisex scent, especially if your skin tends to draw out sweeter notes the way mine does. Good sillage and staying power. Definitely full-bottle worthy, especially since this is one of the more affordable Lutens offerings."

My first reaction was ""aah awesome!"", second was: ""I want a man to wear this!"". Unfortunately I have no one to hose down with this and that is the bitter part. Guess I'll just wear it myself.

Dreamy smooth oriental that does not feel cloying at all. I don't know about hay, but I grew up having horses, so maybe that's why I don't really think this qualifies in that regard ;) Honeyed tobacco with spices sounds more like it. It has that dryness that I like, it's not dripping of honey, it's just there making it cosy rather than sharp.

If you are a man contemplating buying this or any of those aquatic, metallic concoctions, please choose this."

Some we bought bottles, some we rejected and some we forgot about. Chergui is one that I forgot. I have had a decant for at least 6 years. Today I decided to wear it again.

This is the first time my wife smelled it on me. 3 times this morning she has said that I smell good. So a bottle is now on the way. :)

Chergui is a beautiful tobacco and honey that is slightly powdery on my skin. I get good projection and longevity.

This one is worth a sample."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Initially the fragrance is hot, it's outdoors, it's dirty. I feel like I'm at a farm bailing hay, sun drenched and exasperated. But it retreats, within 15 minutes the honey notes begin wrapping around the picture of hay and dry tobacco. While sweet, it's not diabetic, only complimentary. Ultimately the perfume mellows out into a creamy amber with mild and delicate smoke notes. Like sitting in church after services are over, there lingers something resinous in the air but it's faint and passing. The heat dissipates, it becomes a cool to the touch leather. After 4 hours the hay has muted, the tobacco matured and mutated into the smoke note. I think it's very pleasant, very unisex, and appropriate for any weather. I really want to revisit it when it's warmer outside. Solid 8/10

A friend was wearing this years ago, she smelt incredible - on her it was a mix of rose and honey and I had never sniffed anything like it. I ordered myself a bottle, it's unlike anything else I own and initially can seem a little strange but the drydown is worth it. There is definitely tobacco, a hint of hay and some honey but the tobacco is never too much and thankfully I find that element of it does get muted down once it has been on the skin for a while. For me this is dusky rose, honey, greenery and amber. I think it's a love or hate one for some, I'm definitely in the love camp. If you wear this people will definitely ask what you are wearing as it's such an original scent."

I intensely disliked this fragrance for the longest time because of a perceived animalic note. But I can say it’s Hay and it’s certainly grown on me. I would say Chergui is a fragrance that matures a persons taste to appreciate things that aren’t necessarily aesthetic or beautiful, but they are interesting.

Hay is the most apparent note that is wrapped in a dark, resinous honey with a spicy tobacco. I appreciate having Chergui in my collection as it deviates from my abundant gourmands and uber feminine or conservative classics. I still wouldn’t wear it outside even though it does draw curious side glances, I can’t really see an appropriate occasion for it.

It’s unisex, but veres slightly masculine. Excellent longevity and a powerful sillage."

Personally, I prefer the old version as it has a better balance between the notes of tobacco and honey, which is neither too sweet nor too smokey.

Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","A weird fragrance, there is an opulent opening of a spicy tobacco with a sharp, screeching honey. The texture is dense and heavy.

There is something weirdly offensive that presents itself in the dry down. It almost has a repulsive effect. I feel as though SL may have hidden an animalic note, as many perfumers do in order to provoke the subject. But he slightly tipped the jar a little too much and it’s just overbearing. Whilst I absolutely adore Chanel Antaeus and Oud Wood intense, this is just straight up gross.

It veres masculine, mainly due to the array of strong, dominating notes and an absence of sweetness or floral tones.

This is definitely a more challenging fragrance and I won’t repurchase it. Despite its success online, I have struggled to meet anyone in my family or work group who actually likes it."

If you're expecting a tobacco-centred perfume then steer away. This is mostly hay, orris root, and honey, based around a vetiver base.

I have few tobacco perfumes (Herod, Volutes, Spicebomb, Fuielles de Tabac, Aramis Havana), and tried others including Mystery Tobacco by Carolina Herrera but I cant associate the tobacco note in Chergui to any of them (because I can't smell tobacco here!)

Performance is amazing on me, I sprayed yesterday and can still smell on clothes. The drydown is yummy and soft, and I enjoyed all phases of this perfume.

It is unisex and I would happily wear and share with my other half.

Is it full-bottle worthy? It's a yes if you like to smell unique & different. My bottle is running low and I would probably get another one in the future."

Longevity? Excellent - still a skin scent 16 hours after applying.

To my nose Chergui and L'Homme Ideal EDT have the same DNA. Chergui starts with the sweet tobacco, L'Homme Ideal starts with sweet almond. LHI drys down into a leather/tonka bean warmth, while Chergui goes almost to that same scent on me (and I have no idea which notes are actually making that up)

A little bit intense for what I like to wear on a workday, this is a prime one for my weekend rotation. Will definitely be looking at picking up a bottle."

It's a great winter fragrance with a mix of warm and sensual notes that had me sniffing my wrists all day. (How do you do that unnoticed?)

My nose gets sweet hay at opening and then amber says ""hello"" at around the thirty minute mark as the scent deepens. This will last me a good 8 hours or more.

I own three Serge Lutens and find all to be high quality and sophisticated. I can't discern why ANYONE would choose Spice Bomb over this. To each their own I guess...

Think of Spice Bomb as your noisy classless neighbor - the one you close the blinds for so you don't have to see them. Or worse, they see you and come over uninvited."

I had heard of comparisons to Herod, with more people preferring Herod, so I did not seek this one out.

I mostly get tobacco and rose, with an underlying sweetness I am guessing from the hay. I am surprised that I like it as I didn’t think I would like it with the hay note. I used a little bit from the dabber and I am getting wafts of this from my wrist. It’s really beautiful, I’ll grab a full bottle if I see a good price."

I’m completely flabbergasted as there is no leather mentioned in the notes, but what the heck, I often have a problem to detect leather in the actual leather fragrances so why not to have it the other way round for a change:-) It must be the honey and tobacco giving it this waxy quality. At the same time, it is quite powdery and you will keep getting occasional whiffs of vanillic undertones. The sweetness comes from honey and amber, but it is by no means overpowering. I’m big fan of Lutens and Chergui was one of their creations that kept escaping my attention (despite being highly regarded in the frag community). I have to say it lived up to its fame and sits firmly on my wishlist now."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","I have the latest version (2019 production date) on this fragrance and here is my initial analysis. The tobacco, hay and honey seem to be much more pronounced than I remember when I had an older formulation back in 2011. That one came across as much more powdery. To me, this reminds me of an older gentleman on a homestead, coming home from the hay fields, wearing a tweed jacket and smoking a pipe with honey flavored tobacco. Very warm and sensual. Now onto the performance. I can tell you that the reformulation(s) have not hindered the performance with this in any way whatsoever. Projection is very strong for the first couple of hours but then settles closer to the skin, which is what I think you would want in a fragrance such as this. As far as longevity goes, forget about it. I sprayed 1 spray of this on my hand at 12:30pm yesterday and as of 9:30 am today, it is now just starting to go away. So, at least 21 hours of longevity. If you claim that this fragrance doesn't have good longevity there are only 3 reasons for why that is:

1. You have a fake
2. You have extremely dry skin
3. You have very unrealistic expectations on how long a fragrance should last and believe that if it doesn't last at least a week on you, that it's not good enough."

I've never heard about Chergui. One of the reps was new, and I was teaching her about all the notes and sniffing the PDM's. Anyway, she was impressed about how I knew all of the fragrance names etc. I asked her if she could make me a decant of Chergui. At this point, we've sniffed about 20 perfumes because she wanted to ask the senior rep a question for me that was busy. She sniffed it from the cap, made me a decant and said WOW! This is the best fragrance I've ever smelled in the entire store. It's very light. Compare to Spice Bomb? Are you out of your mind? I have the first batch, and that synthetic smelling trash isn't even in the same ball park. Now, I'll admit Spice Bomb projects, but Chergui is a much more pleasing scent."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Subjectivity and opinions is what makes fragrances so great. No doubt this is a pleasant fragrance if you enjoy the sweet powdery tobacco genre.

For me, this is dominated by amber and tonka (hay) and iris...giving off an extremely pleasant sweet powdery vibe. The tobacco is only in the background to add complexity and depth. This is indeed a very sexy unisex DNA.

Longevity and projection are slightly above average for me.

No doubt I recommend getting a sample and checking this out. My issue is it’s a bit redundant to a number of fragrance I already own (i.e. MFK Grand Soir, D&G The One EDP, etc. etc.)."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","This is definitely a fragrance that you have to allow to dry down on your skin to judge. It evolves from the initial spray, and I think that it would be fair to say that it's going to pull something a little different based on your chemistry. It definitely is far softer, and closer to the skin than I thought it would be. But, that isn't necessarily a bad thing, either.

The initial spray is almost entirely dominated by the hay. And, there's a somewhat medicinal note that smells similar to cherry cough syrup, but drier. I know that some people say that there is a cherry note to this scent, and I think the camphorous nature of the wood is why it seems medicinal. This dries down to a somewhat sweet, creamy sandalwood scent on my skin. I don't retain the florals, though I did detect them as I wore the scent. Overall, I really like this scent. It makes me sad that it doesn't appear to have much longevity on my skin (probably a unique problem) because it is rather delightful.

As I sit sniffing my wrists, I would say that this scent reminds me of Maroussia (I posted it above). And, I wouldn't say that they're close enough to be a dupe, but they share enough notes in common that they have a similar feel to them. They wear about the same, and I wonder if the same trick I use to get Maroussia to last on my skin will work with Chergui (fingers crossed). I believe that if you like one you will enjoy the other, and they have a passing resemblance."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","I blind bought a sample and i love it. I can detect tobacco from start to finish, it has this sweet and spiciness vibe, IMO. I know lots of people not gonna like it, but it's ok. I know that: when you spray a perfume you gotta ALWAYS let it sink into your skin, and wait a couple of minutes until it develops and that's when you will appreciate the aroma. I know there are lots of perfumes out there that smell TERRIBLE at first spray, but when you give them some time to sit, you'll surprise and will appreciate.

I had a sample, in a small atomizer. Dark, dense, thick honey and hay, it would transfer to anything in my bag, sunglasses, pens, papers. It was tenacious. I wasn’t a huge fan, I enjoyed it, but more out of curiosity. The dusty honey hay accord, drew me in, but it always let me feeling flat, as it was a dense thick fragrance.

Then I ran out.

Now it appears it is Aqua Chergui. What was once dense thick honey hay, opens with a light transparent sweet mist, and settles into something resembling Chergui. Not as tenacious as my first introduction to Chergui, not as interesting either."

Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Country Club Lounge...

This is a warm slightly sweet Oriental, tobacco leaves on a amber and dray hay bed with a touch of sandalwood.

To me this smells like entering in a refine high-society country club, during a cloudy evening fall. You've been outside and its getting cold, and then you enter inside and this warm comforting feeling is what you get when you spray this on.

Downside here to me is its performance. I like bold, rich, long-lasting fragrances and this one, from a recent purchase, it is not. I can imagine this has gone through a number of reformulations, but now it is what it is, a beautiful cozy skin scent. (at least in my skin... so you should try, and get your own conclusions)

Uniqueness: medium

Scent: 7.5

This is perfume perfection of a certain order. So powerfully soft. Like being pelted by a soft fragrance-infused leather whip..

Its superb and so much better after 30 mins. There is too much natural deep depth in this mix to inhale in such concentration. I think that might induce a headache and why some say this is headache inducing- this is full of ingredients that can have a narcotic effect if sniffed while damp.

So complex its not good for me at least,to breath the opening in. When I let it sink into my skin, it morphs into a soft leathery soothingly sweet blanket of animalic grace. A comfort scent perfect for cooler weather. Sexy too especially when it hits the powdery drydown, but not soft, sexy is the word. I love it and its special for special moments.

My 40 mls will last for years. Sublime mix.Just. Get. It."

Enchanting honeyed tobacco and hay. Sometimes depending on the weather, you can feel also the dried fruit or traces of the leather and sandalwood in the drydown.

The sweetness may be too intense for hot days, though I have to admit that I use during summer nights, especially if I know/plan how the night will end ;).

Warm, sensual and very very addictive ""french"" oriental. I love it! I think it makes me soooo suave - an interesting and confident mature man someone can easily fall in love with.

It wasn't always that way, however, as it once smelt like laundry detergent to me. Luckily I decided to go against all natural instinct and give it another go because ... oh, my. This is stunning. Truly beautiful. I'm about to buy a 50mL bottle after yearning for it for almost a year and a half. This is the richest, warmest tobacco scent you will ever smell. Sweetened by the honey and smooth incenses without an ounce of harshness of vulgarity. It is charming and friendly without pretension. The best of the best Serge Lutens and one of the best fragrances of all time. In my honest opinion, of course. A real French fragrance."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","This fragrance has earned something of a cult following and has, in my opinion, the character, performance (longevity more so than projection) and uniqueness to warrant such. It is unfortunate, therefore, that I personally don't care for this fragrance.

Something in the opening rubs me quite the wrong way, I believe it may be the hay note but the sweetness has a jarring quality. To my mind, in conjures an image of some kind of plant/ insect debris that has died on exposure to the scorched surface of a cattle grid, and started to ooze under the heat of the sun. It is sweet, rich and gum-like, it has an inedible quality, but there is nothing religious or temple-like in the incense used here. It really does have a strong farm-like association to me, but it is not remotely animalic or dirty.

The dry-down is much more tolerable, even pleasant, in my view, being a fairly classical warm sweet incense which lasts as a skin scent for some time. On me, this fragrance lives for about 7 hours, about half of which I'm not enjoying. I do think it sits quite close to the skin. Its massive popularity and the fact that it's different warrant a try from an enthusiast, but be wary of blind purchasing in this instance."

I barely get any tobacco, honey or iris after the glorious opening.

The best one word description would be ""warm."" There's definitely honey and tobacco and sweetness, and a warm, dry leafy smell that I suppose is the hay note. It can seem a bit aggressive and a bit herbal on first spray but it settles in so nicely and isn't unpleasant at all to those around you. It smells delicious and warm and comforting; very sweet but not in a baked goods way. More like pure honey melted on hot rocks and dried leaves outside in the sunshine. I don't get any powdery scent at all. I also don't notice anything particularly floral - there's a naturalness to it that reminds me of nature, but not in a 'green' or floral way.

Today was a stunning sunny winter's day - cool, crisp air with clear skies and abundant sunshine.

The climatic conditions seemed to bring out all the rich depth and nuances of this spicy, warm concoction. The honey and hay notes really flourished.

I also wore it to the massage I'd booked. It added a comforting layer to a very relaxing experience.

I like it, pure and simple, but I'm not sure that I would personally add it to my collection because I find it lacking in something. I want a disruptive note to offset all the delicate smoothness.

Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Edit: the reformulation in new style bottle is a far cry from the original. A different perfume, with dissonant notes and a strange sourness. All creaminess and depth has gone. The far dry down resembles the original, but is weak and almost watery.

Firstly, in my mind is how to review this complex aroma in a few words?
leather! there is a prominent animalic leather note in the base, which was a surprise! and an unexpected camphorous note too. the initial blast a complete surprise. do i smell oud? rose oud? none of these notes are shy notes.

As it dries in first half an hour, I am searching my smell brain am eventually recalling Habanita - sweet tobacco, leather. Yet here is no billowing powder, Chergui is creamy, leathery and deep golden. almost chewy texture.

Camels chewing dried grasses, billowing tents. Enclosed within, the scent of rose oil perfumed incense embedded in the textiles of desert worn leather and wool. Honeyed tobacco wafting, but not to me the main notes. Sandalwood peeks out towards the end.

an unexpected scent journey for me, as leather is not listed and thankfully Chergui's tobacco isn't surrounded by that odd chai latte that other tobacco scents evoke for me.

really enjoying Chergui, for its complexity and strong character. I probably wont be buying a FB, but if there is tobacco I like so far, this is the one I like best."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","More than all else, this fragrance is an invitation, less to forensically inspect the quality or distinctiveness of individual notes, than to engage the ""personality"" of scent: it's individual character. More on this later. It's long lasting, but soft, almost imperceptible to the wearer, while apparent to passers by. It has almost no top notes. Therefore it's linear, I'd say synthetic. More on this later. But it's got a butch feminine vibe. Really the smell of counterculture, of revolution. Musky tobacco? Maybe a man with some feminine traits. More on this later. The actual scent is maple syrup sweet throughout, but with a leafy yellowish salty musk furriness and a dominating greasy/soapy/oily flowery roundness. But really, all the notes are synergistic, working together to convey that daring, subversive personality.

It is indeed nice, but I find that in the past I rarely found an appropriate time to wear this. Come to think of it, today may be the only day I've worn this for an entire year. It's one of those fragrances that you have as more of a measuring stick."

This one is a truly unique scent,it is just above the gender question,it won’t make you smell feminine or masculine but very interesting.
On a close sniff,it evokes a hammam spa smell,refreshing,calming ,a little cedary. It stays there but when sprayed on the back of my neck where I usually wear my perfumes,it totally takes a different turn,a U turn,if you like and becomes more of an oriental creation. It just gives that Middle Eastern vibe : there is sandy dust,dryness,rich aromatic ,slightly sweet honey and a bit of tobacco. So beautiful and long lasting,2-3 spritzes and you’ll be able to sniff it all day. Sillage is very good,my sister complimented me on it from like 2-3 steps away .
I liked it so much that I tried to sample as many scents from the house as possible. Most of them I didn’t like except for Gris Clair and Amber sultan,but they probably won’t be FB for me.

Maybe it's my body oil mixed with this that's playing tricks on me. I will keep testing...

Often listed in most reviewers top 10 go to scents for tabacky.

Not for me. It’s safe and awesome but there are better. Not the most ground breaking SL.

It’s simply summed up a dustied, honeyed damp tobacco.

More astonishing on receiving my new bottle today was after all this time why Killian Light My Fire was so familiar. It’s an unflattering overpriced copy (Yes! - I own it). It’d been a long time since I had tried Chergui. Chergui is brighter and dustier where as LMF is a touch more syrupy and sweeter. To me it’s a blatant 85% emulation for a ridiculous skew in price - so - yep - when I run out of both I will just be buying SL Chergui again.

I know it's a favourite of many. But I thought this would be a lot richer, and warmer than it was, based on the notes.

I'd been excited about the sample I got for this, but after spraying it on, I'm not all that impressed. I thought this would be rich, smoky and sweet, but on me, it just smells clean. Clean, and powdery, almost like laundry soap. I'm not entirely sure what's going wrong with it on me, but I don't smell any notes on the note list here.

I think it's this powdery cleanliness that conjures to mind Maroussia, by Slava Zaitsev. I don't think they necessarily smell the same, but they have the same powdery cleanliness of Maroussia.

As a niche fragrance neophyte, I sensibly acquired a few samples from the house of Lutens to see what it's all about. Chergui is the only one of the lot I would consider pursuing further, though I admit it took me several trials to make up my mind. As others have noted, it's complex, unique, and chimerical - but what sold me is its unique structure and development. I've never tried a scent that took so many unexpected turns while maintaining solid performance. I can't imagine how other reviewers have found this perfume to disappear after a few minutes.

His day consisted of long smoking sessions in his room, watching television, going to the park to chat with his friends, and buying fresh bread from bakeries early in the morning.

Whenever he left the house to do any of those things, my mother would go and spray deodorant in his room to get rid of the intensely sweet and dark tobacco smell.

I find it very ironic and interesting how this smell is perceived differently in cultures. In mine this is the smell of a chain smoking old man that should not spread to the rest of the house, in other's this is something that people would choose to smell like during the day and hail it as their favorite perfume."

It took a few wears for the strong hay opening to grow on me but now that it has, it gives the warm tobacco such interest, and the honey really rounds it out without getting cloying. I can't imagine getting sick of this scent. It's both comforting and interesting."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","The word ""chergui"" comes from the Arabic ""alshrq"" or sharqi, which is the name given to anything that comes from the East, namely the Eastern wind in Morocco. Serge Lutens lives in Morocco and is passionate for its culture. Many of his inspirations comes from this magnific country, so diverse in habits and human geography. Quoting Serge Lutens about Chergui, he defines it as ""a fire spread by the wind"" referring to the eastern wind that blows from the Sahara desert, hot and dry like the perfume.

To my nose the fragrance composition enhances hay sugar, honey, tobacco leaves, incense and amber as well the inevitable wood. There are some types of hay leaves with a high sugar content, like the sugarcane hay and the ""hay of Greece"" (methi or fenugreek). In the case of the latter, its seems to have an aroma very similar to the aroma of pancake maple syrup, adding this way an unusual type of sweetness to the perfume.

Serge Lutens ideas and Christopher Sheldrake execution, managed to achieve an exquisite and pleasant and unique result. Even if it is a very ""flat"" fragrance (not a defect) it opens mainly with the floral scents of rose and Iris. A moment later you notice the enclosed sweetness of honey and amber covering the fantastic dry Virginia tobacco leaves, This stage lasts for 2.5~3.0 hours with an above average sillage and projection.
To frame this unique scent with similar fragrances is quite difficult. I would say that if compared with designer known tobacco fragrances, is miles away from London and Havana and just a bit close to Dreamer, but the dryness and the sweet hay marks the difference. After this stage, the fragrance remains dry but becomes smoother, while the incense and the woods evolve to a suede like scent. All through its duration, Chergui is quite masculine for my nose and I have some difficulties to consider it unisex.

The juice is a thick shade of maroon that wouldn’t seem out of place sloshing around in a brandy snifter, but Chergui isn’t necessarily a boozy scent. It just has a great deal of body.

Chergui is the only fragrance I own that comes with a cap, allowing you to remove the sprayer and convert the bottle to a splash. After a few wears, I made the switch, because there’s not much point in trying to wear it conservatively. Better to lean into its weight; let it blanket you in its warmth, rather than apply it lightly in attempt to make it something it isn’t. To smell Chergui is to experience its influence on the bold philosophies that drive niche perfumery. When they build the Perfume Hall of Fame, Chergui will have a shelf all its own."

It just smelled like menthol and hay to me. I put it on again today and got that same initial blast of menthol and hay that was almost overwhelming, but then after about 30 minutes to an hour it settled into this lovely honey tobacco scent that I'm really loving. It's not a smokey tobacco, it's like you are in a house in the country and you opened up a wooden tobacco box and took a whiff. While it's sweet, the hay lingers to dry out out a bit. And it's slightly powdery in a way that keeps it interesting. This doesn't seem like a scent you'd wear for compliments (I don't wear any scents for compliments though as I'm very sensitive to people who can't handle scents so I try to keep all scents close and just wear them for me) but it's a scent that makes you feel cozy while still being interesting."

There are no signs and you have to ask a local where it is. There are no rangers, fences, or cameras. Yet, there is no damage or graffiti. Everyone goes with curiosity and leaves with respect. If you go, bring a ladder. Legend has it---the petroglyphs tell a story of the falling man. Someone in the tribe was poisoning the watering hole and he was murdered. I do not know if the legend is true but I’ve been there a few times and it is hallowed ground. Remember to look up, because high on an outcropping is a bird of prey nest. The blue sky, red sand and white snow (in winter) transforms the spot into a desert kingdom. Chergui reminds me of this secret spot. (As do others, namely Tauer) But Chergui has an echo. A heartbeat. Smelling it is walking into myth, wearing it is becoming a legend."

The same thing happened to me, and has happened with many other fragrances I think have cinnamon.

UNIQUE. Screaming quality. This is a true solid release from Serge Lutens! very well blended.

I'm not an expert to analyze the notes but I can detect: Tobacco, cacao, honey, amber, soft incense & mellow iris! so it could be described as a soapy tobacco scent.

In terms of longevity it's +10 hours (sprayed 2 sprays on wrist)

I should be stocking bottles from this. It is a great great great release I cannot get enough of how awesome this bottle smells!"

I live in a warm climate and tend to save it for the slightly chillier winter months like now and when I wear Chergui, it just wraps me up in this deliciously sweet, spicy yet tender embrace. I tend to change my fragrance daily, yet I find myself wearing this for days at a time. I wear it to work and get many compliments. It is not too strong nor over the top at all and you don't need a special occasion to wear it. It lasts the whole day and goes into the evening. I actually prefer Chergui to Dior's Feve Delicieuse which I find too cloying for my taste and it's less expensive, too which is always a plus. You usually can't go wrong with a Lutens and Chergui is my favorite of them all."

Every sniff feels like a game of roulette to see what note you will pop out next (Lotion->Honey->Barnyard->Lotion->Tobacco ad nauseam).

You know how some notes have temperatures? The way ginger and spice 'feel' warm, and lily cold?

Despite the honey and tobacco in Chergui, there's something cool about it, like the sensation you get when you smell mint. And it loads what could have been just a cozy feel-good fume with total sophistication. (I suspect it's the hay.)"
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","This is all scented talcum powder. Typically speaking I’m a great fan of unisex powdery scents, but not to the point where it seems like I am actually wearing powder under my clothes. It is sophisticated and moreso for an older person. More feminine than masculine, but I can see some men wearing this for the dry down. The hay note is not as bad as I would think it would be. Well blended, but to the point where it’s hard to discern any other notes, very small amount of tobacco if any. Would not consider this a tobacco scent but a powdery scent. The color of the fragrance gives a false impression that it will be a darker scent, it’s light. Certainly not a blind buy. Reminds me of the food network meme: “I made a breaded chicken piccata with lemon jasmin rice.” and the judge goes, “um this is a chicken nugget.” Overall, happy to try it and can certainly appreciate it. But this is not something I personally would buy."

Later, I get honey, amber, tobacco, sandalwood. The powder that people are describing smells like powerful sandalwood to me. I like it. After drydown I think it ends up almost like a sweet, soft, hippy type of scent- like a clean, lovely, flannel shirted, long haired mountain man who might be managing the fireplace on an early fall day and the smoke lingers on him.
I'm sure the other notes round out the fragrance, but they do not stand out to me."

The longevity is literally about five to ten minutes. Then i sense very little. Its there, very very very close to the skin. But thats it. Its a pity, too, because this is a classy take on the back alleys of the Medina in Tangier or Rabat. The pigment sellers in marrakesch....thats what it reminds me of.

Fell in love with the hay opening which is very velvety and way elegant, Marlene Dietrich style. 2 hours later the hay tons down to leave space for the amber/tobacco/honey accord which on my skin smells like hands that played with groceries then picked dirt form the floor turning into a dusty musk sweetness, not vanilla sweetness. The strange thing is that the smell is so wonderful on me that my wife always gets close to sink her nose on my neck and kiss me and always compliments me on how delicious and sensual I smell.

Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","I can easily understand why people like Chergui. It's smooth and well blended. Unisex. Adequate performance.

I would love to love this perfume.

Everyone and their mother aleady mentioned the strong, initial burst of hay, so let's talk more about the Tobacco instead. In Tom Ford's Tobacco Vanille it's gorgeous from start to finish and more about the tobacco leaf. Chergui on me is very... I-smoked-a-Marlborough-just-now-and-trying-to-hide-it-with-my-sweet-perfume-ish. There is even a very faint note of old sweat. To be fair, after 30 mins the tobacco has weakened to nearly tolerable levels. ""Nearly"", being the key word.

So for now I will give Chergui a ""Like"" and try it again in a few months. It's hauntingly beautiful on all my friends (all genders); creamy, sweet, powdery and warm. It's not Chergui, it's me.

Edit: a friend pointed out that maybe I shouldn't be hatin' on the Tobacco, maybe I should be hatin' on the incense? Maybe? I've never before had an issue with incense… I'll think about it.

Edit 2: I can't stand the opening. After about one to one and a half hour it's a truly stunning fragrance, full bottle worthy even! But the process of getting to that stage… Can't do it. The combination of sweet-hay-smoked cigarette-sweat… Damn."

Spicy amber with Smokey incense and woods. The rose and iris are listed because of the nice baby powder vibe. I do not get honey or tobacco. Truly unisex, nothing feminine here.

It smells like a sweet ambery drink on a rainy day in a farm stable. Although that may not sound that appealing, it smells fantastic in my opinion. Sillage is moderate while longevity is quite good at over 6 hours. This is one of the best amber offerings out there as far as quality and uniqueness of scent goes.

I'm smelling all the same notes between the top and heart notes, but somehow they become more and more well-blended as time passes. I don't know that I would be able to pick out the tobacco if I didn't already know it was going to be there--everything just melds together so beautifully to be a somewhat sweet, ambery, delicious scent. I normally don't like honey as a note because, rather than smell the honey itself, I feel like it just sort of mutes whatever other notes it's blended with, but in Chergui the honey is used perfectly to bring everything together in a very pleasing way."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Velvety. Like fine, yummy red velvet cake. Very sensual. Refined. Intoxicating! There is a very subtle sugar in this fragrance. Mixed to perfection. Nothing juvenile, but very elegant.
A heavy elixer indeed. The warmth, the spices, the leather, the top back on, the mix of the sugary goodness. What can I really tell you about this. It seems that it appeals to the masses but yet keeps to that niche that we all love. A very unisex fragrance. This is another one that my husband and I share. I think however, I do wear it more than he does.
The performance of this fragrance, is most excellent. Above average. I actually smell it on me the next day. When I wear this fragrance, it’s one of those that I find myself grabbing my own wrists, and sniffing, and sniffing, I just can’t get enough. Pure indulgence in a bottle."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","I am being slowly seduced by Chergui. I wanted a beguiling oriental scent, like the winds of the Arabian desert... But, it was too sweet. And the baby powder was an unwelcome surprise. So I said goodbye to Chergui...

The other day, I was being hammered by a SA about it. So I sprayed Chergui on paper and put it in my car. A few hours later, ""The car smells really nice..."" I shook my head, and ignored it. But over the next 1 hour 20 minutes the same thought kept popping up. I transferred the test strip to my bedroom, and every time I entered, ""The room smells MAGICAL!!!""

Whatever it was, however it was, why-ever it was - I decided Chergui was a quality beast! It's better than most niche scents. And it's magnetic. You don't need to be looking out for it for it to charm you!

True, it's not what I was expecting. Much less ""oriental"" and more sweet and powdery. Still an oriental. Soft and whispery - not like Ambre Sultan - which is spicy and full-on, and I think I was comparing it to.

I'll try Chergui on skin, and if it is equally wonderful I will add it to my collection!"

Your ambery goodness is alluring, potent, and compelling, but unfortunately I am testing you on one wrist while I am testing Ambre Sultan on the other, and Ambre Sultan wins. Your brightness doesn't call to me the way Ambre Sultan's darkness lures me in. Maybe it's all the heavy, resinous amber oil I wore when I was younger, I don't know. I understand why you are popular, but I just can't join your legion of fans. Very close, but not quite.

Update many hours later: The dry down is decadent, warm, and creamy, exactly what I was craving. Ok, you win. I just ordered a full bottle because I am weak and you are beautiful."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Ooh this is a beauty! Very different and distinct.
It sort of smells like a tamed down TF Tobacco Vanille - once you get it to calm down, give it a good shower and let it have a rest. It has the same sweet tobacco & creamy vanilla quality, but sultry and seductive rather than all-out bestial and skanky.

The opening is sweet, so sweet that I honestly thought I could smell tuberose or something similar, but apparently there are no white florals in this! It must be the combo of amber, honey and sandalwood, as the perfume does open with a strongly sweet, creamy, 'white' smelling blast that comes across as white floral.

The projection is above average to strong, and the longevity is excellent as it lasts more than two hours on my skin - which tends to eat up the overwhelming majority of fragrances within 60-90 minutes tops.

This is a really standout perfume: elegant, sultry, seductive, intoxicating, and unisex (leaning more on the feminine side, though)."

Once it settles down the whiffs are sublime & embracing. The trick is not to over apply but target the chest and pulse regions.
In the drydown the tobacco & hay are faint and the honey more pronounced with notes of iris and tonka.
At this stage, you get a phantom cocoa note emerging from the combination of the basenotes lightly resembling LIDGE L'Instant De Guerlain Extreme.
Class in a bottle.

Like the shifting sands and water of this African paradise, the perfume shifts and morphs on your skin in so many ways, maintaining a delicate balance between the modern and the ancient. Chergui takes off with a nice tobacco leaf, delicate iris and rose, and grassy hay accord. As it begins to settle once notices a honey, incense and ambery centre. Finally it settles into a musky powdery base comprised of sandalwood, musk and amber. This scent is the stuff of dreams, exotic yet never overwhelming. In fact, this is probably the world's first true unisex perfume, a masterfully blended beauty with moderate sillage and projection and very good longevity. One of those perfumes I always had the pleasure of having a bottle in my collection since it first arrived on the market some 15 years ago. A true masterpiece of modern perfumery. Enjoy!"

Now I am wearing it.
Received it yesterday with another Niche fragrance: Acqua di Parma Cedro di Taormina, the type of fragrance that puts a smile on my face, no matter what.
But it's 8 degrees C. today, so I'm wearing Chergui. A type of fragrance that will have ""to grow on me"".
As if that would be possible. A perfume doesn't grow on us, we (try to) grow on them.

Question is: should I want to broaden my horizon, while there are already so many fragrances that tickle my senses positively, from day one?
Do I really need to expand my ""collection"" when most of the stuff I have already is being neglected?
But it’s this insatiable desire to find fragrances that will knock me off. The Holy Grail.
I’m sure it won’t be Chergui though.
The weird thing is that I realized, it will be like this after I tested it last week. I guess I just wanted something different. Which it is.

For now, it reminds me of Jaguar Classic Red.
For one sixth of the price, that one is far more wearable.
Sure, Chergui lasts longer, but it takes about 3 hours before I start to like it.
And if it’s exclusivity that I’m looking for, something that not “everybody wears”, than I’m sure that Jaguar is the more exclusive, lesser known fragrance.

In time I will let you know, if it grew on me."

I'm absolutely in LOVE with this fragrance, I wore it when I started college so it holds many memories. When I first smelled this I knew I was going to keep it for the rest of my life.
Lots of tobacco with warm honey, it turns hot on my skin after a few hours and into a powdery soft hay with some musk. I do wish the lasting power was a bit stronger for what I pay, but I still love this nonetheless.
Gourmands, fruity florals, fresh citrus scents tend to do better on my skin, most spicy orientals never work with my chemistry. However, I think this is a good introduction into spicier fragrances, because of the sweetness it still works on me.
I remember a few guys asking if I was wearing a suntan lotion saying I smelled like I was at the beach.
This is a staple in my fragrance collection! Women should try this if you're into ""dark"" and ""sexy"" fragrances.



P.S I find this is similar to Spicebomb by Viktor and Rolf, but that one turns into a dryer sheet on me."

I was really expecting more of a tobacco scent. On me, all I can detect is a sweet amber (amber is one of my least favs). I have used a single spray, bottle arrived today, 3/22/18. If anyone wants to purchase or trade, please message me."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","On me: cool, bracing, aftershave notes that smell manly.
On my partner: sweet hay, soft tobacco, warm honey.

I have never experienced such a huge shift in notes from man to woman, and unfortunately, it goes the wrong way, smelling like men's aftershave on me, the woman, and a spicy oriental women's fragrance on my man.
Try before you by, this one's odd."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Bee-young-ka nailed this- The baby powder dry down is a weird turn-on. Im guessing it comes from having used Johnson's baby oil in the bedroom at some point in the past. When combined with the other (background) notes (tobacco, musk) you get something that is akin to the smell of a bedroom after sex.

Would smell incredible on women folk."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Amazing! Tobacco, amber, incense, and honey. “Beautiful” is the only way to describe it. Easily the best tobacco based fragrance I’ve ever smelled. On the sweet side but done very, very well. In fact, other brands should use this as the benchmark for how to use honey in a fragrance. If you like only one of this type of fragrance, it will be this one. Sillage and projection are moderate to heavy with a solid 6 to 8 hours before going to skin for 4 to 6 hours more. Warm and wonderful from beginning to end. Masculine leaning unisex perfect for evenings or a crisp day. Super classy. This one is back up bottle and signature worthy. Easy to over-apply so easy on the pump. Worth every dollar and a stone cold bargain if you get it at a discount. Well done Serge!
5 out of 5."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","Chergui for me smells sweet and slightly seductive, like burnt honey, it is reminiscent of Arabian nights but without a heavy Oud vibe, This fragrance is definetly unisex and depsite it's sweetness it is perfectly fine for men. the smell is very pleasing, but the performance is disapointing

Longevity 5/10 - after only 2 hours I can't notice this anymore except on my skin, for the price this is disappointing.

Silage 7/10 - the silage is decent for the first hour or two"
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","I always see this pop up as a comparison for some of my favorite spicy fragrance. It's always noted as being the better of what I consider a favorite
(like Diptyque Volutes). So my expectation were high.

Possibly too high. I wasn't impress and it wasn't the Cinnabar(Estee Lauder) or Opium(Yves Saint Laurent) I thought it to be.

My problem with Chergui is that it is too dominating( i.e masculine). It's just very heavy on spice, pepper , tobacco and not ..well... balanced. Something powdery, citrus or floral should have been added to make it likable for me.

Volutes is more my speed. However, Chergui a sophisticated fragrance( as it is rightfully considered by many on here ),-- but just not my speed.

2/19/18: Its Tom Ford Sahara Noir that this is compare too. Sahara Noir is intense but with a wink- Chergui is just intense."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","ok, let me start by saying Serge Lutens & Chris are my favorites.

But this I find to smell sooo powdery.

expensive black tie but still incredibly powdery.

Wish I could smell even one other note!
On me to my nose, pure powder.
...but its not a dry powder.
this is a very damp scent, fetid even.

weirdly sexy.
Freudian weird.

Smells better on the men folk."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']","I hate tobacco, I hate incense, I hate hay, but I LOVE this.

This fragrance is so well balanced and blended. The tobacco does not smell like cigarettes, it is sweet and almost herbal. The hay does not smell like barnyard it hints at animalic notes and makes me think of expensive saddlery. The incense is not a dusty church but a deep mysterious smoke.

An intriguingly seductive scent; unique, rich, and just a hint dirty (in the best way)."
Chergui Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2005,"['amber', 'sweet', 'tobacco', 'honey', 'powdery', 'woody', 'green', 'smoky', 'warm spicy', 'floral']",Expertly blended tobacco and hay formulation - possibly the best frag in the SL line. Highly recommended.

I can't say about the sillage, since until now I've received no comments about from people around me, and it surprise me because I've sprayed it four times (on neck and chest and both wrists). I cannot smell anything around me, but only if I put my nose in my shirt. Well, I don't wanna say I'm disappointed, but..."

Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","From a house that often scares me, I was amazed when discovered this green juice many years ago. I had developed an idea that I was someone not suited to citrus notes; they seemed to go ""sour"" on my skin after a few hours, especially in very hot weather. So, I was very surprised to learn just how many citrus notes are in this one (though I guess the name should have been a clue) and I think it was when I learned that not all citrus is equal, least of all where my pedantic skin is concerned. Not being one of those fragrance professionals who know the turns of phrase with which scents should be described, my oversimplification to sum it up was ""fizzy, green, cream soda"". I also suspect there's something unexpectedly Nordic about it , again odd, given the materials. But I noticed that when I was wearing it in Norway and Sweden people would usually make positive comments. And after a while I noted a certain similarity to some of the crisp, clean herbal aromas coming out of their summer kitchens of raw and cold dishes. Please understand that all of this is meant in a hugely positive way: it remains one of my go-to options; the perfect antidote to a sweaty, busy day when you don't want to be the person others move away from in a meeting."

The citrusy-bitter-green opening is like the sun coming out from behind a dark cloud! Citrus fades to soapy and you feel like you're in a shower all day. I understand how people say it doesn't last on them; I feel like I get immune relatively fast (20 minutes or so) but I guarantee that EVERYONE around you will smell it ALL day. From time to time, I catch a whiff of it on myself - it's elusive like that.

On fabric it lasts a long time, it may fade but it will certainly be there on a forgotten scarf months later and quite recognizable. Awesome flac and gear that comes with it. This is (again) a staple."
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","I think I've figured out why there are so many reports of ""this lasts so long!"" with other reports of ""does not last at all!""

In my experience, Mugler Cologne lasts super long (like insane longevity for a fresh scent). When I was testing it in the store 2 years ago I got some on my jacket arm by accident and I could smell it for 2 weeks without putting my arm near my nose. I was blown away by the crazy longevity on my jacket. After using it for a while and specifically re-testing it yesterday/today I am now at my conclusion.

Last night I put one spray on my arm (skin) at 10pm and today I can still smell it at 2:30pm wafting in the air after I just did a bunch of pushups etc. If I put my nose up to it, it's strong. That's 16 freakin hours.

This is the type of scent that can hide out as a skin scent for a while UNTIL it's reactivated by body heat at which point ppl could be like ""I thought it was gone but it's 16 hours later and I smell it again! What the heck!?""

People who spray it on the back of their neck or somewhere away from their nose might think it's gone but they should try getting their body heat up to see if it starts projecting again."

Got a decant, not sure of year, batch etc. Sprayed on inside bend of both elbows after shower around noon, going on 7 hrs now and it's still projecting. Constant whiffs. Been reading comments about poor performance. Dry skin, skin chemistry, idk but it's great on my skin."
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","I find the Moroccan soap story very fitting. Although when I smell it, it doesn't remind me of a Moroccan soap, but it takes me to a holiday in the mediterranean.

I purchased the small bottle in duty free, used it in Andalusia, Spain. Years later, I purchased the large bottle online, it is refillable; which I appreciate. I find the juice in the smaller bottle slightly more intense.

This gives comfort in a hot day. Gives sense of cleanliness and happiness in any day all year round. A very simple and minimal fragrance, but not flat. Nothing is missing!

I never spritz this one without getting positive comments from men, women, children, experienced noses, ordinary noses... A true crowd pleaser. But this crowd pleaser has a personality!

At home, I use it mainly for the gym, when I go for a run, after a hike, or even simply after shower in the hot summer. I use it everyday when I'm traveling in a warm humid climate.

No it doesn't have any resemblance to Tom Ford's Neroli Portofino other than that both have citrus notes, inoffensive and less long lasting. Both are stunning and favourites of mine, they are very different!

Cons; No sillage, weak longevity (which is expected of a cologne)
Pros; it smells clean and expensive. Unisex. Safe to wear anywhere, anytime of day, any season.
Solution; get the big bottle and decant. Carry the decant and reapply on the go.
Best scenario; early morning, a loose white linen dress/shirt."

At today I still remember the impression it made on me. Was an absolute delight, unique and so unlike all other fragrances around.

Just a few days ago I went reminishing about it. From more recent reviews it sounds as if it has been reformulated - what a pity, this was an incredible number! To those who complain about longevity: please note, this is a cologne not an EDP ;) ... and it was suave, unlike the many around these days.

Seems as if with time people's nostrils got used to stronger and stronger scents, and now seek punches not caresses of notes... or maybe pollution rendered us anosmic!"

It’s very bland with a slight crispy green note. I wish to God that there was a resemblance to Irish Spring but there’s just a boring, diluted coincidence to Green Tea. There’s a weird bitter base note in my sample also. I don’t know if maybe the juice in my sample turned or if that’s attributed to this scent in general. Nothing really special here to me. There are so many better alternatives on the market today for a “clean, soapy, fresh out of the shower” scent that have stood the test of time. J Lo’s Glow, Elizabeth Arden’s Green Tea and Tommy Girl are all cheaper with better longevity than this. I also find them to be pretty unisex as well.

I love this scent so much it's my most used bottle in my collection because it's a very good dumb reach and I use it literally every day after I get out the shower and carry an atomizer with me to respray throughout the day I do 5 sprays 3x a day.

Great for the summer or if you just want a fresh clean feeling.
I don’t know if it’s just my batch but performance leaves a lot to be desired.
2 hours if you are lucky and not just based on my nose alone.
Would recommend just not a great performer."
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","I purchased Mugler Cologne a year ago because I heard it smells a lot like Irish Spring Soap and figured that this could be a go-to work scent for days when I just wanted to smell clean and freshly showered and didn't want to make it obvious I was wearing a fragrance.

This is certainly a safe and inoffensive work scent, one I used a lot last summer and this summer at work.

That said it smells nothing like Irish Spring soap. I have a bar right beside me and they smell nothing at all alike. Irish Spring is very green, a synthetic green, but green nonetheless. Mugler cologne on the other hand smells like neroli, bergamot, and a floral, orange musk. I probably should have expected as much given the note breakdown, but for whatever reason I was expecting the green, soapy freshness of Irish Spring.

This does smell soapy and very fresh and clean, but not green or herbal.

Mugler cologne smells like a more unisex version of my mom's signature scent D&G Light Blue. I gave her a decant of Mugler cologne and she loves it. It leans a touch more feminine than I'm used to; I wouldn't call it a feminine scent, it's firmly unisex, but don't be expecting a masculine scent like Irish Spring.

Mugler cologne is an excellent, office safe scent that'll have you smelling fresh out of the shower for 8-10 hours."
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","Thierry Mugler Cologne opens with a strong projection of citrus, musky and soft green accords, the opening is sharp, intense, vibrant, fresh, simple but very pleasant. The bergamot is a prominent note, citrusy intense and sour; the neroli and orange flower are also noticeable, a white floral note, slightly bitter, with hints of orange. The petitgrain is noticeable as well, evocative of orange leaves, with a green touch. The white musk is the last and projecting note, this musk isn’t animalic or pungent, a very tone down the type of musk with good projection qualities and well blended with the citrus notes. The fragrance is relatively linear, the bergamot loses some of its initial sharpness but it is noticeable from opening thru the dry-down, also the initial strong projection takes one step down to moderate. Once Thierry Mugler Cologne has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a moderate projection, neroli, bergamot, and white musk fragrance with green petitgrain accords. The fragrance feels airy, casual, clean, cold, diurnal, fresh, green, modern, musky (white), refreshing, sharp, short-lived, sour, unisex, versatile, zesty and pleasant.

Scentrack: Fun Lovin’ Criminals – Half a Block

Allegedly, the inspiration for this composition was a hotel bar of soap that Thierry Mugler brought from his trip in Morocco. I can sense that specific hotel cleanliness in Mugler Cologne, but this Morillas’ composition is much more than just another soap. In my opinion, Mugler Cologne in among the best composition inside a very rigid, and historically important cologne genre. Other two compositions I admire the most are Vettiveru by Comme des Garcons and l’Eau de Tarocco by Diptyque.
Mugler Cologne is a fresh, extremely clean and genderless scent. The composition opens with strong citruses – piercing neroli, bergamot and balanced dose of chemically clean aldehydes. In the body there is a soapy note of white flowers, again a very clean bouquet. The base is made of laundry fresh musk. The special feature of Mugler Cologne is a clean, steamy note of hot iron. Like dressing up a fresh, clean shirt on a sunny morning. I believe that mysterious S-molecule is a Steam, not a Sex molecule of “post-coital liquids” what the rumors say. If you are looking for a happy, clean and reasonably priced cologne look no further. Simple and great stuff for a hot climates.

P.S. The retro-futuristic packaging is great, like a part of Captain Kirk's bathroom.

Being a big fan of 4711 I’d been looking for that freshness with longevity, this is it, but with a stronger soapy element. I have a bottle from 5 years ago, so not sure if it’s been reformulated. However, you can tell the structure is simple, so hard to imagine that would change in quality. Amazing lasting power for such a clean fragrance, Makes you smell clean no matter what you’ve been up to!"
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","A few years ago Creed would send out free samples of their products. I was sent a small decant of Original Vetiver and on the first spray, I was in love. A natural and refreshing fragrance that makes you feel clean and sophisticated. It took me a few years to finish the small decant so I could not justify the price of Creed.

Mugler Cologne takes the place of Original Vetiver for me. It is more synthetic, doesn't seem to last as long, but still gives me that incredibly clean and fresh green profile I want. This is not a diss to Mugler Cologne, but rather what initially attracted me to it. Comparing the two, I see Mugler as more casual, which makes it even better for me.

For the price, this checks the box for a beautifully clean and soapy fragrance, which is odd because it is also synthetic at times. It almost becomes a scent that is your skin, if that makes sense. It is light but bold at the same time.

I think this is a fragrance that everyone should smell. It is in its own world, especially regarding its history.

Overall: 6/10

EDIT: The more I wore this, the less I liked it. I keep getting a sharpness from this the whole way through.

I actually sold it and have a bottle of my first love coming in (Original Vetiver). To me, they really don't compare in quality. OV is a lot nicer and richer on my skin, where MC lays sharp and linear. OV is just blended so well, it is impossible to beat.

Personally, I would shell out the extra cash and get something I love rather than like. I am slowly doing this with my little collection and trying to get it all down to loves."

And it doesnt cal for a gag reflex...its not heavy like that. Its sneaky heavy...and you'll get whiffs, ALL DAY LONG. I cant speak for some sort of recent reformulation.

Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","Ordered from Amazon Germany what from the photo should have been the original Mugler Cologne and bottle, but instead I received the Mugler Cologne Come Together bottle. Unfortunately I was distracted and noticed this only after removing the celophane, opening the box, and seeing the bottle.

Used a couple of sprays on me to test it, and also applied on a kitchen paper towel, and left it on a book that has a plastic cover. This is a test I have done repeatedly on many fragrances to check their longevity (among the longest lasting I've tested so far: Bentley Absolute, and Dior Fahrenheit.)

I checked the smell on the paper towel for a few consecutive days. Amazingly, and to my surprise, I could still pick up the Come Together fragrance from the center of that paper towel after the second, third, and even fourth day.

The vendor contacted me because of my negative review on them. And even if I had removed the cellophane and used a couple of sprays, they were kind enough to accept the return and offer full refund. Because of this, I removed the negative review. The wrong photo is still there on Amazon.de though, but apparently it's something they have already asked Amazon to fix, and it's on Amazon's hands for quite some time already.

In any case, I then tried to order again the original Mugler Cologne from another Amazon market vendor hoping to get luckier, and luckily enough, this time I did the original and taller/slimmer Mugler Cologne bottle.

Now I did the same sort of test, couple of sprays on the center of the exact same kind of paper towel, and leaving that paper towel resting on a book that has a plastic cover. After the first day already, I barely can pick up the scent from the center of the napkin.

To me (again without comparing side-by-side, just from memory, which can be quite misleading) it seems to me the original is more natural smelling, fresher and lighter. Come Together might be longer lasting, but it seemed to me sharper, possibly less natural, more synthetic smelling.

Take these impressions with a huge grain of salt, since I am doing so myself. Would like to compare side-by-side but haven't been able to do that so far.

PS. Update couple of days later. Actually I can still pick up the scent of the original Mugler Cologne from center of the napkin. Still seems to me the Come Together was more noticeable after this number of days, but of course atomizer differences might play a role. Again side-by-side comparison would be ideal."
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","I don't agree with the Original Vetiver comparisons.

Tested the Thierry Mugler (OG formula) vs 2011 OV.. Mugler cologne is actually a bit soapier and smells nicer in the air.

You can actually smell some Vetiver in the Creed. I would say they share neighborhoods but they aren't even on the same street.

I own and like both."

If you don’t like citrus/white florals you won’t care for it. However if your a neroli lover like me this is great. Very refreshing. One of the best. A classic.
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","My opinion is obviously in the minority here so do what you will with this. I ordered a decant of this specifically because there are so many glowing reviews of this fragrance here on Fragrantica.

It is 55°F today with moderate humidity and one squirt of this stuff is screaming its way across my entire apartment. When so many people have described this as being soft or pleasing, I am absolutely shocked at how loud and in-your-face synthetic this fragrance is. I see so many reviewers say that this is their go to fragrance for hot summer days and I cannot imagine this in the heat and humidity. I started wearing fragrances in the 80s and I am not averse to powerhouse scents but they need to be made with quality ingredients and well-composed.

This is not a fragrance I hope to smell again on me or anyone else. I definitely think there is a place for clean, soapy, laundry fresh type of scents but Mugler Cologne is not this to my nose. It smells more like institutional-grade floor cleaner."
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","It starts off smelling very close to creed OV opening and finishes smelling very close to neroli portifino dry down. Either way its a great fragrance at every stage. Very good quality and smooth smelling unlike a lot of muglers darker colognes. I get really good performance from this especially considering the type of scent it is. I think the s note is steam. It has a freshly steam ironed shirt feel which s lovely and clean. One of my go to spring scents. Citrus, soapy, grassy, musky, floral all wrapped in the creamiest cleanest vetiver."

A cologne, as its name indicates, very fresh and clean.
Mugler Cologne has nothing to do with the Mugler collection as an aroma as it is the freshest of all and nothing invasive.
It opens with a scent of neroli and bergamot, it also contains 3 more notes that I do not know much but I suppose they must smell very good because the mixture is really nice 😍
I always use it after the shower in spring and summer, when you need to feel fresh.
A moderate sillage and longevidad of 4 hours or so.
Its price is really cheap! I like it a lot!"

It opens with bergamot and a touch of soap and quickly dries down to a soft, grassy, vetivery dream. I know the notes didn't promise this but with that radioactive color I was halfway expecting it to smell like Mountain Dew (which TBH would have been amazing). I was pleasantly surprised by how soft and natural it smells. Nice find!"

Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","Was looking for soapy/clean scent. Lots of posts mentioned Mugler Cologne. I smelled Creed Vetiver in store. Researched Creed Vetiver online and they compared Mugler Cologne to it.

So, blind bought Mugler Cologne. Fits the bill. I have a sample of Creed Vetiver.

I'm no expert, so the way I would describe the differences are that sniffing straight from the bottle, Mugler really smells like soapy water, while Creed smells only slightly different...like you can tell it's a cologne.

When on my skin, the vetiver is slightly stronger with Creed, still soapy but sharper, while Mugler comes out just nice and clean and softer. Creed Vetiver lasts longer on skin but with the vetiver slightly more noticeable later,

But Mugler was fine too...about 4 hours before became skin scent....sprayed some on my undershirt, and still scent on it afternoon at office.

I also blind bought Al Haramain Portfolio Neroli Canvas. Also a nice clean soapy scent. The neroli comes out stronger on that, but it lasts longer than Creed or Mugler.

The true-est soap scent between the three, to me, is Mugler Cologne....nice soft/fresh/watery/shower-clean scent. Some scents start out as something else, then in the dry down some people describe them as soapy. Mugler Cologne makes no bones about it. Soap/clean/fresh from beginning to end. I just wish it lasted longer.

Funny comparison : I think you could spray Mugler on yourself 10 times, and people would think you are just really clean smelling and spilled some soap on your clothes, but if you spray Creed 10 times, people would think you showered, then put on a soapy cologne."
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","I smelled it and bought a bottle. I loved the freshness of it and find it unisex, I wore it a few times though. To my nose it smells mostly neroli with a thick oily smell. I don't exactly know how to describe this oily side :). It works best in very warm weather. Mugler Cologne is a taker if you want a fresh perfume in summer whether you're a an or a woman. This cologne made me then recognize the neroli note in perfumes, so I guess if you're a néroli lover, you won't get disappointed."
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","More than just soap! Mugler Cologne has plenty of layers. First there is a fresh, green, translucent neroli. Then there is a stroooong petitgrain, adding a sharp neon greenness to the scent. It almost smells like freshly snapped foliage. Green green green green. The drydown has the most captivating skin-musk I've smelled in a long time. It's almost like salty skin, very fresh and warm, but not like laundry or any generic soapy skin smell.

Mugler Cologne smells oddly organic and real, which is unusual for Muglers as they are generally some level of otherworldly synthetic. For example, Alien's jasmine is synth-y, and A*Men has that rubbery asphalt. It's unisex, maybe leaning feminine as the neroli is prominent. The newer version does not last as long as my older bottle, which lasts all day long with a single spritz."
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']",I absolutely love this. It's clean and fresh but definitely more on the masculine side. It's very green with a citrus hint and musk. Doesn't have amazing lasting power but it would be good as a gym scent or something to throw on after swimming maybe. Or just a nice summer scent on a really hot day
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","The orange blossom is very evident and cancels out the bergamot, making the high point of the fragrance be the ability to isolate both aspects of the orange blossom, that is, the floral-fruity (neroli) and the most intense green (petitgrain). Unfortunately, however, for a minimalist fragrance with few notes, green and supposedly natural, the aroma is more artificial than it should be - even for designer standards, and this was clearly compensated by making it excessively soapy, which disharmonized the well-constructed orange blossom. Ppl say it served as the basis for copying by Creed with ""Original Vetiver"". Good performance."

Seems like a bright fragrance to me. It is a lighter scent and doesn't linger too long.

Definitely like Creeds Original Vetiver minus the hints of wood and longevity, also didn't start off as intensely green as Creed OV but the dry down is similar."

Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","Definitely in my top 5 and one of a handful of fragrances I can say I love wearing.

I grew up In Arizona, and back in the day, Arizona was known for its citrus groves and each spring you could smell the orange blossoms, especially at night. The smell always made me happy as did spring. This takes me back to those days due to the neroli in this.

I’m very big on masculine's and this is far from it. It's neither masculine or femiine. It's just clean and fresh. This is my dumb reach above all others.

I enjoy how Mugler Cologne makes me feel. So few fragrances can do what this does to me, that is to say it makes me feel motivated, happy and inspired. This does that extremely well. It is a very energizing fragrance that makes me feel good about myself. So if you are looking for a fragrance that plays on your mood, do NOT sleep on this.

Now I don’t get the whole soapy thing. On me it smells like a cologne, not soap. This smells like it has Vetiver in it, but it does not, perhaps it’s the petitgrain ? The neroli and apparently, petitgrain, play very well together. I wear this year around and for any and all occasions.

This is also great for everyday use or the office.

Respray about every 4 hours, 2 to 4 sprays. On that note, the opening is incredible, so respraying is a highlight of this fragrance.

10 out of 10. Perfection for me.

UPDATE: I found an amazing clone of this. It's called Unbreakable Love. It is a unisex frag and man are they very similar. I picked a bottle up for $15. Unbeatable if you can't find Mugler Cologne or don't want to pay the $40 +."

It didn't stop me from buying the Chanel, but I found another fragrance to love... and I think I might love it even more than the Chanel. They're really only comparable in the sense that they're fresh and green, so it's not like having one means you don't need the other.

Mugler Cologne is so clean and fresh. I can't stop smelling my wrists whenever I wear it. It might be the most beautiful soapy fragrance I've ever come across. It's so well done. The citrus isn't overpowering. The floral is neutral enough to keep it unisex. It really is exquisite... and that's saying a lot from me, because I'm not even a huge fan of green scents"

A clean, fresh fragrance that is perfect for when you want to freshen up. Or any time you want to grab a cologne in passing to make you smell clean.

If this is a fragrance you choose to get, for this price, you get exactly that. What you won't get is exceptional performance, although it performs better than I initially expected. I get a good few hours out of it and decent project. That does require 6 sprays or so though. And some help from a little bodylotion.

It's fresh, clean, nice. It smells really good. It is perfect for its purpose. It is nothing remarkable or exceptional and wasn't meant to be.

Perfectly created fragrance given what it was meant to be at an affordable price. If you like to have a ""let me just freshen up a bit"" fragrance in your collection, give this one a try."

I’m not saying this is a bad cologne, I just think it has been hyped too much. If you want a good soapy smell, try Prada Amber Pour Homme.

I was gifted one of the big bottles with the TM embossed in the glass, no label.

It's so light and airy that there's almost nothing to it. But it just sort of hangs out and dances around you. Really great when it's simply too hot to wear anything else. Also completely appropriate for gym or any other occasion where strong scents are a no-no.

I can picture this as the signature of the no-nonsense professional who buys the biggest bottle despite the fact it has to be applied two-handed, simply because they abhor shopping and are determined not to buy a bottle more than once a year!

Another I'll give to hubs, just because it's more of a ""men's"" scent and something I think he might like, though it honestly might be too weak for him. If so, I'll be happy to keep it as my afternoon refresh spray or after-shower spray.

Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","Finally got my hands on this one. After being unimpressed by A*Men Pure Havane and Pure Malt, in part due to seasonal inappropriateness, I can finally preach a little about something from Mugler I do happen to like.

A quick note about my biases on Morillas -- I started with Acqua di Gio at a young age and I do consider him to be a superstar parfumier, to the point of his works being too popular to the point of unfashionability (sic). If Morillas did it, chances are, it's an over-marketed, over-hyped fragrance. Easy to steer clear of for someone such as myself, who is searching for fragrances that aren't very well known. I don't like smelling like anybody else. That is just me.

Yet, enter Mugler Cologne, which I have no real problems with. It's a designer, yet isn't widely used, and the scent is very agreeable. The lore is cute and unpretentious and the result is what everyone tends to say it is: clean, soapy, mostly inoffensive, and easy to wear.

It seems perfect for anybody who is restrained about the projection they emit with heavy fragrances, be it a personal choice, culture, or what have you. This is up there with Molecule 01. Not because it doesn't project, but because the scent itself is, as I said, very agreeable.

Seems excellent for hot days, as I intend to be my use case for it.

To address the seasonality votes, or the rating here on Fragrantica, I'd say Spring/Summer is spot on, and I do agree, such a simple scent might not ""deserve"" a 4.3, but I do think it's worthy of the hype. Clean scents are kind of underrated a category.

This review is off the back of my hand. I will know if the scent is intoxicating (in a bad way) if sprayed multiple times and for a day out in humid and hot weather. I can detect that, for the wearer, the scent might get headache inducing, but maybe that's just right now because I keep sniffing it."

Yay. I'm a fan of green so the bottle attracted me and having no other info about the frag, tried it on. The opening is more masculine, citrus, sea salt and cedar or cypress, to my nose. Wonder what the secret S ingredient is? In the middle, it started to smell like pistachio, which I love and reminded me of Bvlgari Omni Green Jade. Go figure. The drydown 4 hours later finally gave me a soft clean floral and that made me happy. I could still smell it on my wrist this morning so longevity is good on me. It's sweltering summer here in Texas so I plan to wear this a lot. I think it's a good unisex cologne. And yes, I'm female."

This is an extremely clean, citrusy soapy DNA. It has wonderful clean top notes that is your quintessential out of the shower vibe. I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did. This is not a knock on this, but it has the same vibe as one of my favorite Summer aftershaves...Citrus Musk by Clubman. The dry down bring musk up to the forefront which added to the fragrance. Overall, extremely pleasant DNA you can spray liberally with.

Longevity was about 5/6 hours before it came a super close skin scent. First hour had decent projection. My wife commented had great I smelled when I walked into the room.

I voted “love” instead of “like” because of my perceived value here. For the fresh out of the shower genre, this is a HUGE value for money. It’s so inexpensive per ml, it’s hard not to own this."

Not worth the 4.28 rating.

I have it for 3 years but everytime I use it with hot weather, I feel sorry for wasting the oppurtunity of using a (much) better Neroli/Bergamot/(Petigrain)based fragrance. I have plenty of them and they are all better than this one.

And if it is the soapy accord you're looking for, unless you have a magnified nose, you will be disappointed for there is none. Better go for a Acqua di Parma colonia. Assoluta,Essenza, Intensa. those are soapy. Or Prada Amber.

If it is the soapy Musk accord that you like, than you really should try Kiehl's original musk.

Also the performance is average at best, even for these type of fragrances.
My guess is both Mugler and Alberto Morillas are both (highly) overrated."

However I have to say this Cologne is absolutely fantastic. Apart from its gorgeous fresh grassy minty smell it evokes memories of going to the barbers shop as a child and smelling from the bottles of splash on that were fashionable in their day.
Enough said, this gem is highly rated here but looks like its already discontinued. Its as scarce as hens teeth. If you can find a bottle snap it up. Why oh why do they discontinue Colognes such as this. It makes no sense whatsoever."

Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","Just starting off by letting you know this review is from a woman who wears Mugler Cologne.

Mugler Cologne is the freshest, happiest spring/summer scent I've ever had the pleasure of smelling. The opening is gorgeous and I could just keep spraying and spraying it just for the opening. It's fresh and so not screechy or loud that I can spray it all over. I spray it on my neck, hair, arms, clothes...oh dear lord I just want to jump inside a bottle of it!
Just for a short moment as the notes transition, it sort of has a bug spray smell. I was like, ""Whoa...hold up!"" I was getting worried there for a minute, but it gradually kept changing into a gorgeous green fresh cut grass with a tiny hint of musk and (I'm sure) the S note. Beautiful! Just beautiful!

It doesn't take long at all before Mugler Cologne turns into a soft skin scent as far as me being able to smell it on myself. No worries though, I promise you will leave a trail behind you which is what happened to me. I had sprayed it several hours before I went shopping at a clothing department store and a woman sniffed me out from the beautiful fragrance trail I was leaving. She quickly approached me awkwardly laughing (thought I was going to have to do some judo/taekwondo moves or punch her LOL) as she said to her friend, ""I found it! I found the one who has it on!"" Then she said ""I've been following this perfume all over the store. What do you have on if I may ask? It is beautiful!"" With my hand clutching my heart I breathlessly told her what it was (with wild eyes and a smile of coarse).

I bought Mugler Cologne because of all the raving reviews but I was a little concerned about the weak sillage. I had just received the EDT only a few days prior to my shopping stalker experience, lol but I was thrilled to learn the sillage was good and people could still smell it around three hours into me wearing it.

In my opinion don't be afraid to blind buy this.

Edit: My husband and I are now fighting over this bottle of Mugler Cologne.Haha! He literally hid it from me and I've searched everywhere. He says I have plenty of perfumes...this one is his! I guess I'll be buying a new bottle sooner than I expected to"

I'm not so sure about this one. So strange. I could see it being unisex, but I don't personally feel I'd want to wear it. Seems I'm in the minority by not raving about it, and I LOVE citrus. It feels more like eating the bitter white part of the orange than the juicy orange part. Perhaps I need to smell it on a clean man to truly appreciate it."

Like fresh green leaves after a rainstorm, that's how described this fragrance, my nose detects the Neroli, Bergamot and the Orange flower in the opening and then on the dry down
more of the Neroli, Bergamot, and Musk. Getting that bitter orange vibe as well from the Orange flower, Bergamot and Petitgrain. Excellent release from the Mugler house. To me probably one of the best fresh fragrance currently. All the notes are blended well. Excellent scent for the summer and as well an office scent. Definitely a must have.

T+5min - already less citric, just smells like bitter greens. So bright and fresh. Smell is strong and clear from 3"" distance, light airy wafts from 9"" distance.
T+20min - the bitter greens are taking on a slight soapiness. I wouldn't say it smells like soap exactly but I get the comparison.
T+1h - still able to smell it very clearly from 3"". Sometimes I catch airy wafts easily from 9"" and sometimes I have to get closer.
T+2h - can smell it from 3"" clearly, it's getting lighter.
T+2.5h - can smell it from 1"" away, pretty much a skin scent at this point.

Very linear after the first 5-20 minutes, but that's not at all a bad thing as it's so lovely, bright and airy. Seems nice for popping out for quick errands in the summertime."

Beautifully made. I get the similarity to Creed Original Vetiver, but it's different. Brighter and slightly fresher and warmer at the same time, but not sweet at all.

Mugler is often in the spotlight for its Angel/A*men series, with which Mugler pioneered the ""gourmand"" fragrances. Too bad these are shadowing other Mugler's creations, and I think that this Cologne deserves much more attention given its singularity at that price point.

A big weakness though: its performance. Indeed, after spraying, it quickly fades into a skin scent and will be totally gone after a couple of hours (I applied ~20sprays in double layer). I like it, but glad I paid just ~$60 for a 10oz bottle.

Now I will only use this when I know I'm going to be outside or in an expansive indoor venue like a mall.

One more thing: On my skin, this smells different than on a paper or sniffing it from the atomizer. The musk is more pronounced on my skin AND there is a slight spiciness that comes out. So if you are worried that all you'll get is Irish Spring soap, don't be."

It has a very refreshing natural bitterness and I can't imagine anyone disliking it. I would compare it to Dior Eau Sauvage Cologne flanker, but it's much cheaper, less synthetic smelling and has also some traces of that old world soapy citrus fragrance vibe like in Acqua di Parma Colonia. You could say it's like a cleaned up and modernized version of the latter.

***

Of course, no danger of overspraying for the scent profile as well as for the performance. 6 sprays from a decant sprayer, and 15 minutes later, my GF had to dig her nose into my shirt to smell anything. There was some projection in the first hour, but after that, it became a skin scent, and at the 4 hour mark, the scent seemed to have vanished except for some faint traces on clothes practically indistinguishable from the smell of the fabric. So, you probably have to spray a bit more, and then there would not be much difference price wise with Dior Eau Sauvage Cologne (which performs better and needs less application). But scent wise, it has more bitterness and less sourness, which seems to make it more realistic."

It truly is a slightly green,aromatic, slightly citrusy,slightly soapy masterpiece.

Perfect for casual wear spring and summer

It will not offend, is not daring , but smells quality and full for a aromatic, which I love to find

I recommend this over the molecule series and is a real step up from Lucky you by LC

4 to 6 hours and fair projection and some good sillage"

Overall this is a perfect causal scent that a little refined and will never offend.

It is lovely to have a fragrance that not only has some nice citrus,helps you feel clean, but also last and projects.

Highly recommended for everyday casual use. I find this a spring,summer nights and indoors and fall day fragrance only.

I too think this is more modern and smells better than Original Vetiver by creed"

Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","This is one of fragrances I put out of my mind , but shouldnt have.I used to hear so many reviewers say it was soapy and nice, and I thought I didn't want that.

After smelling this it is a clean, citrusy aromatic with a little soapyness. It is fresh and clean, but does not smell like irish spring soap or any other odd impression I got in my head prior.

Anyways, this is a lovely, casual, easy to wear second skin kind of scent that last quite well and isn't cologne concentration, like I thought. It last 5 to 7 hours and has fair projection and seems to come back in the heat too.

This may not be the party scent, or show stopper, but such a easy to wear , likable and clear replacement for molecule 01 ,in my opinion, deserves more love.

I used to love lucky you by LC as a clean, fresh second skin smell and this is much better and a soon to be purchase.

Happy sniffing !"
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","I already left a review about this cologne but I cannot resist doing it again simply because it is my all time favorite everyday fragrance. in fact I cannot even imagine a man loving this cologne. It feels feminine to me. I am a person that always has gravitated towards masculine smells in selecting my fragrances but this one doesn't even smell masculine at all to my nose.

There is only one small problem and that is the mugler cologne does not last on my skin more than 45 minutes. I have read a bunch of suggestions about other cologne that smell like this but none of them have been unisex. I do not understand why there are not more women's perfumes that smell fresh soapy and clean like this. Why does it have to be a man to smell clean? This is far better than smelling like a flower in my opinion.

Lastly if you want to I have discovered that this can be layered with many other fragrances. One that works particularly well is a beautiful perfume that's really inexpensive simply called Fresh Life. You can get a bottle of it on eBay for $20. If you go on Sephora it'll cost you 50. It layers nicely and that one is also a very fresh smell as the title indicates. It just happens to last a little bit longer for me. Just an idea in case anyone is interested in trying it"

Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","This perfume is not citrusy on me at all, it is very soapy. To me it smells somewhat similar to Crabtree and Evelyn's Jojoba soap which I adore. However after a few hours it does not smell fresh on me anymore, instead I smell a very musky, dirty note that lingers in the dry down. I guess the S-note in it is not for me. It is also not very long-lasting."
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","I am a woman and I like a lot of different things but in the summer I like sharp citrus and fresh smelling types of colognes and perfumes. I'm kind of all over the place and what I wear every week. I still wear vintage poison at least once a week and the rest of the time it's fresh life or Tom Ford NP.

I bought this because someone suggested that this smell like Tom Ford in P. While it does have some similar notes and overall smells clean and fresh just like Tom Ford it is not a dupe by any means. But after I tried it it smelled so good on me and so clean and fresh which is what I want living in the mountains of West Virginia and not getting out much it doesn't make sense for me to use up my Tom Ford when I could get the same effect essentially from this. So now I save the time forward for when I'm going out and every other day I wear this one. In fact I love this so much that I bought a second one already for a backup.

I live in a small town in a mountain in West Virginia and there is literally no good shopping. So I have to really pre-plan everything that I'm going to buy and order it while it's online because there's not a chance I'm going to get to a store that selling it.

Now that I have the fresh clean scent covered I'm going to go back to focusing on trying to find a Dupe for vintage poison. I was given some ideas and multiple people recommended a perfume called incanto. That one smells so far from vintage poison that I may as well have just gone ahead and bought the current version of poison. I know it's off subject but if anyone has any suggestions please let me know. I can't get past my love for poison. When I was 15 it came out and I was immediately addicted. Now I'm 48 and just as addicted if not more to that beautiful scent. Nothing like it."
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","So finally I bought this one! the opening is very very similat to CREED O.Vetiver and I am happy because I have Creed O.V and Love it very much and I was looking for a cheap similar scent. fresh,soapy and nice."
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","I really like the way this cologne smells, but only after the dry-down. The opening, to my nose, is extremely synthetic--it's cloying, and irritates my eyes. :/ I think there might be an aroma chemical in Mugler Cologne that I'm allergic to, and that's a shame. Does it smell like fancy body soap?...Meh. Does it smell like like Irish Spring soap?...Nope, not at all. Does it smell fresh and clean?...absolutely. I think the smell is more reminiscent of a laundry detergent than a body soap. Imagine the most luxurious detergent money could buy, and the synthetic, clean, floral, musk quality it would posses. That's what this smells like. Don't get it twisted, it doesn't smell like Tide or Gain, this is much more subtle smelling than either of those. However, MC (especially in the opening) has an undeniable synthetic-quality about it that links it to a laundry soap. When I'm wearing it, I get faint whiffs of Dolce & Gabanna's Light Blue. When the chemical concoction that this is settles and fades the wearer is left with a nice citrus-vetiver-musk. It's good. If the first 2 hours didn't irritate my senses, I'd rate it an 8/10 overall for what it is. If you just want to smell clean, I don't think you can beat Mugler Cologne."

Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","I got MUGLER COLOGNE hair conditioner which was provided in an expensive hotel. It smelled so unique and good that I had to check, what is this??? I absolutely love the scent. It's hard to describe. It's both very green and fresh, but also remarkably rich, and somehow even sensual. I was surprised to see neroli listed as top note here. I do not like neroli at all and I do not sense it in Mugler Cologne. The floral note here is more like lily of the valley to me. I desperately want this perfume, but haven't found it anywhere."
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","This was my first exposure to neroli/orange blossom and I'm absolutely amazed. The inspiration behind this fragrance was apparently Moroccan soap - and indeed it smells like a very green bar of soap. This fragrance starts off with lots of bergamot and neroli, with neroli being the main note. If I could describe the scent it sort of smells like a green lime to my nose; and I'm a huge fan of it. The bergamot is very noticeable in the opening. As a person whose favourite scent in the world is the smell of limes (and who owns a bunch of lime colognes and aftershaves), this definitely counts as the bergamot here is a very green and potent variety that smells similar to limes. This fragrance is totally unisex and could be worn literally by anyone. On drydown it smells the same as the opening but with less citrus and more white florals. It is extremely pleasant. Sillage is moderate leaning and longevity is extremely good (if I use moisturizer beforehand), running at over 12 hours on my skin and projecting to my nose even without me having to sniff my arm. This is unbelievable for a fresh fragrance. Overall this is a masterpiece of a cologne that I adore quite a bit as it makes me feel fresh, clean, and ""limey"" with better longevity than a lime fragrance - in fact the liquid being green is very apt. This is my favourite fragrance of all time.

Projection and longevity are nothing to write home about indeed. But guess what? This is not intended to be a powerhouse that fills the room, nor a massive compliment-getter. It is exactly what it needs to be. A clean and fresh out of the shower scent. Green, soapy, citrusy. It's unlikely to garner compliments due to its soft nature, but trust me - people that get close to you WILL notice that you smell nice and clean, although they won't go out of their way to say it."
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","Mugler perfumes, like his fashion, are always a bit odd. Like a traditional idea seen through the lens of a sci-fi flick type of futurism. Cologne is like this. It takes something like a traditional citrus splash and adds boldly synthetic notes to all three levels of the pyramid until it smells as technicolored and surreal as the chartreuse-colored liquid itself. It’s a very specific synthetic-aquatic scent that I have recognized on men passing by in Le Marais district of Paris. Not for everyone but worth a try for anyone looking for a powerhouse, long-lasting summertime citrus/aquatic."

It smells like an old-fashioned green bar of soap, my grandmother had lying in her bathroom. However, Mugler Cologne does not smell old-fashioned at all. It smells very simple and clean. Not really an out of the shower vibe, but a mix between freshly out of the shower and a walk through a field full of blooming young flowers on a warm Spring morning.

For me, this is an all-season fragrance. Why should a person not smell squeaky clean in Fall and Winter?

Originally this was an eau de cologne but was upgraded to an eau de toilet strength and they kept the original name of Mugler cologne.

It performs better than it did originally. This maybe why some people say it doesnt perform because maybe they had the original version. The new version is not beastly but it's not bad. It's what can be expected from this type of fragrance.

I fully recommend the latest batch anyway. Mine is great. It works for me and for £25 for 100ml.

So I bought a bottle and didn't try it out for a few weeks other than a test spray on my hand.

I wore it yesterday morning and topped it up for the evening and reached for it again today.

It feels so fresh and clean. It does smell soapy and has little sweet floralness to it and it has a certain edge to it.
I find it's strength good and it lasts well enough considering the type of scent it is. It has a nice projection that's not overpowering. It's really safe to wear without having to worry about it. Can wear it with confidence knowing that you smell great and clean and fresh.
Price is also very good.
Presentation is probably what drew me to this fragrance. The glass bottle is very nice with the silver metal screw on atomizer and it has a strong clear plastic cap that clips into place. The bottle and cap have the TM logo on. My bottle has a sticker on the side at the bottom and MUGLER on the box and not the previous signature box.
I could only find the batch code on the box so keep hold of it. There is no batch code on the bottle itself.
This is a solid purchase for me. Loving it even though it's December and out of season so I'm guessing it will be even better in the spring and summer months."

Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","This is a Neroli based cologne, and so is similar to Tom Ford's Neroli Portofino. I much prefer this. It also reminds me of Jardin Sur le Nil by Hermes. With this you're getting soapy neroli, with a hint of muskiness, just like the description. Whereas I find TF Neroli Portofino too heavy, thick, and cloying, this is light, transparent and pleasing. Like Alberto Morillas' other creations this has a characteristic airy sibilance.

I would worry, with TF Neroli Portofino, to wear it at work for fear of overpowering. If you over-spray this you will smell like expensive soap, which isn't too much of an issue. As colognes should, it fades in a non-linear way. It's still present and pleasant toward the end of the day but it isn't cloying. An excellent cologne great for morning use, daytime, work, summer days etc.

The bottle design is also unexpectedly appealing in real life. It's has a pared-down geometric, modernist (but modern, 21st century) feel, with retro paper stickers and it comes supplied with two caps - one splash and one spray. Koonsian, hyper-real neroli cologne."

In the 90's, TM Cologne was my handbag staple during those long summer months where a 'freshen up' during the day was necessary.
Fast forward 20+ years and I have recently purchased a bottle of Cologne. I was hesitant because I though that the reform wouldn't be as delicious as the original. Indeed, Angel has changed beyond recognition now, being too heady and not as long lasting as the original. I was scared to revisit something that was so beautiful to me all those years ago.
I needn't have worried because as soon as I spritzed I knew that very little had changed. This is a beautiful cologne, fresh, sweet and uplifting. Its gorgeous and totally great for layering. Today I was wearing Gucci Bloom and layered it with TM Cologne, WOW!!! this combo is simply stunning! I imagine that this will layer well with many green florals.
The cologne lasts for hours on my skin, as I said before, all TM frags seem to be made for my chemistry so I can only report on my own experiences. The projection is also lovely and the perfume seems to sweeten with time. (Hell, I am in love again)!

Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","tested, very weak and don't deserve the hype
this should be a household cleaning spray, or bathroom freshener."
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']",Layer this with Molecule 01 or ISO E super and you will have a great fragrance.
Mugler Cologne Mugler (unisex) ~ 2001,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic', 'musky', 'green', 'powdery']","Smells nice for about 30mins.Have bought better summer cologne much cheaper and better quality from supermarkets in the Mediterranean!
Realise now sometimes it is the bottle ,which is lovely and the name which sells a fragrance such as this just a mild,ordinary citrus..
I feel it will be relegated to my bathroom shelf for guests to use freely or as an air freshener.

Sounds intriguing right? Niche when niche wasn’t really a thing. The smell of a cold rainy night in a big city in late autumn. The smell of tires and cold vanilla infused tea. Or maybe vanilla flavoured condoms *wink wink* and a mug of tea long forgotten. But not really, no. My solinote vanilla perfume on my boyfriend’s leather jacket after we leave...the tea shop. Ha! Gottcha, what did you think we were leaving?

Feminine and masculine, simple and complex, light and heavy, proper and naughty, a true unisex. Performance is good, I can smell it all day if I spray my hairline, but it keeps close to the body. Thought it would smell better on a boyfriend, but as a true main character of my own life, I made it mine."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","I'd been meaning to try this perfume for years, so I had really high hopes for it. I'd heard it described as approachably sexy and dirty, like light BDSM, so I expected something heady and complex, but grounded and easy to wear. I'd heard so many good things about Black that I bought a slightly larger than usual sample from Surrender to Chance thinking, ""of course I'll want to wear this all the time!"" Unfortunately, after taking it for a couple of spins, I'm not impressed. All I'm really picking up is rubber, vanilla, and nothing else. It doesn't really bloom on my skin, or go in any other direction, or surprise me at all. I might have gotten burned because I was expecting something more like The Zoo's marvelous Club Design. That scent is also largely centered around rubber, but it unfolded on my skin in this exciting, unpredictable way that kept me smelling my wrist throughout a period of at least 12 hours. It not only had that tire smell Black probably made famous, but the inside of the car as well-- a very nice car to boot, with a plush leather interior. Club Design took me through a nostalgic whirlwind of car trips and sex and beyond, while Black was just... there. Maybe I need to give Black another chance in a cooler season that suits it better, but Club Design might've spoiled me. I'd recommend that scent in a heartbeat to anyone else underwhelmed by this one."

To be honest though, I like the concept more than I like the perfume. Does it smell bad? No!

Mind you this is my personal opinion, but I feel like there is lacking... something! I don't know what that something is. I also don't really know what occasion I would wear this.

If you love perfumes and come across a bottle - buy it! How often do you come across a perfume that's interesting yet wearable anyway?

Whatever! I love this fragrance but more as a piece of art than something I would wear. I will keep it!"

Just received my bottle today. And I am loving this.
IMO.....a combo of V&A Midnight in Paris/Aqualina Black Sugar/Zirh Icon and a touch of YSL Body Kouros thrown in.
I like the vanilla/leather/vinyl-ish vibes.
This is getting more and more expensive on line,so if you are a fan or want to get this....grab it before it sky-rockets $$$$
The performance is actually pretty decent on me.
I may have to buy a back-up !"

Blvgari Black has a vanilla rubber smell and the Prada instead has a amber powdery smell in its place.
I do think if you like Blvgari Black then you would also enjoy the Prada. I feel the Prada is a safer blind buy though."

I have over 100 colognes, I started collecting the past 2 years and It's gotten a bit out of control. I bought some encre noir lately and am shocked how much it smells like black, well at least the black of 15 years ago. In my opinion it has the peppery openings that are the same and even the dry down is the same as what I remember black being.. I'm sure blacks sent his changed over the year and I haven't smelled it since but this is definitely how it used to smell."

Back then I wasn't fully aware of the 'cult' status of this fragrance and didn't know what to expect. When I first sprayed it on my wrist, I was surprised by a note (or combination rather) that I wasn't quite sure I liked. Perhaps that was the notorious rubber/tyre note that is off-putting to many. I accepted it just for the sake of enriching my collection. However, as time went by, I began to appreciate it and the 'like' gradually grew to become 'love'. I don't mind the rubber note anymore because I relish the leather and vanilla fusion that follows (the most prominent notes I can smell) - classy, extravagant and rebellious at the same time. A truly unique scent, such a shame it got discontinued..."

Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Black Bvugari: This product has the neatest packaging. The box has not just a flap but a thick hatch. The bottle sits sideways peering out a window. The bottle is just like a tire. The top is the center hub, and the shoulders of the bottle are trimmed in real--yes real!!-- rubber. Imagine a tire. The tire is labeled BVLGARI. Sitting on a surface it is super low profile and looks like a tire. Wonderful to hold with a thick steel atomizer cap. Metal and rubber.
Just for neat guy stuff this gets an ' A' for originality.
The scent is really original, but not a projection or sillage standout. First off, my skin is absolutely an absorption monster. I sprayed two times on the flat of my arm, both right and left. Maybe 'Gone In Sixty Seconds' ties in with the car thing, but it was a skin scent in about sixty seconds!!!!
What a wonderful, all original fleeting moment. It has a major waft of tire shop which I love. I smell a nice vanilla, not boozy. I think I smell jasmine. I detect a slight orange--the bergamot. So of the eleven notes on the list, I detect only about four. I think the tire smell is from the Leather. This is one of the most original scents, I cannot stop spraying and sniffing.
A real opinion. This EDP offers an interaction of the notes unlike any I have sensed. I believe this is part of the magic of synthetic notes and molecules that are man-made. This unique interaction can only happen with synthetics in my opinion. This is why I think synthetics are really exciting, and just starting to take hold.
Certainly there are endless interactions on the natural note front. Many scents have fifteen or more notes so top parfumers can do anything and go beyond any limit.
As we move into synthetics we will see more accords/notes that are not derived from natural scents. We will see notes that are completely detached from any botanical, animalic or other form. BVLGARI BLACK hints at petroleum products in the form of a rubbery scent.
Do we name it 'Tireshop Vanille'?
I love the box. I love the packaging. I do not need ridiculous duration. My personal taste in scents is that I like 'em to come and then I like 'em to go. Still, I have scents with the deliberate strategy of projection.
Aside: This review is written from my own perspective with bias and attitudes and my own collector philosophy.
Look. . . I do like the crass and artificial scents of the '70s and '80s. I don't mind scents that smell cheap because cheap can be fun--for me at least. There is a cheap side to me. For example, Lolita Lempicka Au Masculine with licorice or Anise. How fun!! Maybe even. . . Put on that cherry scent. How fun!!!! Juicy Couture Dirty English with a base of Escentric Molecule 05. Fun, cheap, naughty.


Also, I like to rotate scents so I don't need a scent that you have to call the HazMat team to get it out of your frickin' Pendleton wool shirt."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Looking at the notes on Fragrantica, I never would have bought this but I smelled a sample years ago and loved it. This was my foray into unisex scents. There was nowhere like Fragrantica to go and check reviews at the time and had I known about the rubber and road accord, I probably would have said no. I'm glad I got it because the drydown is wonderful on my skin, a perfectly non-sweet vanilla leather. I would say it leans on the masculine side of unisex and I think the write-up from the company under the description is correct - this is black tea, not green. Longevity and sillage are moderate on me and I wear it in cooler weather, too smoky for summer. One of my very first adult fragrance buys back then and still glad I bought it."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","There's definitely been reformulation. My current bottle purchased from a grey market site is but a sheer memory of its former glory, veering straight for the vanilla drydown it used to take hours to reach. But it's a vaguely badass comfort scent & as close to a gourmand as this sugar avoider is likely to own. Under $30 is irresistibly affordable by perfume standards. Seems silly not to add it to the collection. Just commit to the overspray."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","This is the brother to Versace Crystal Noir. Bvlgari Black came first. It smells less synthetic and shampoo perfumey than Crystal Noir.

Bvlgari Black has black tea, cedar and leather notes but, they are beautifully blended in. Not the Shalimar level of leather.

I also, smell laconic notes and coconut? in Bvlgari Black. I know it's not what other people are posting in comments, but it's what it smells like to me. The grounded cedar in here, rather than the perfumey floral base of Versace Crystal Noir makes Bvlgari Black more wearable to me. A real bargain price for this perfume.

Both perfumes are made in Italy.

I remember smelling this perfume in 2014. Its been reformulated. Then, the tire note was distinct and stood out. Now it's creamy and refined. Definitely worth trying.

It's not a sweet or gourmand perfume.

I really like this perfume and bought a back-up. Someone else here has said it's discontinued and I can't see it on Bvlgari's website."

I might have bought the last bottle in stock?
Bought it a week before Christmas and now I can't find it anywhere.
Just like the reviewer below me says, it's a unique fragrance in a unique bottle.
I want to add to the record that this fragrance smell a lot of tonka bean in the opening, which makes sence when it's firmly compared to Midnight In Paris.
In the drydown I get musk, amber, green tea and sandalwood.
Warm but distinct.
There might be some vanilla in the drydown. But I don't get any leather to speak about.
The drydown is definitely unisex.

This is one of my old favorites. It's a lovely fragrance for any gender."

It doesn’t matter that once an estimated eight-year-old girl told me that I smell like poop. Believe me, it was Bvlgari Black, not me or my ass.
On the other hand, a close acquaintance of mine told me that the scent is just like a cheap Russian woman.
I have not received any other comments.

Otherwise, if you only knew how spiteful comments I have received for another Menardo masterpiece, Patchouli 24.

For me, Black is one of the best perfumes of all time. Those who hate it can break up into pieces for me.

A delicate powder made of jasmine, rubber, coumarin and vanilla, all massaged together, into a unpretentious perfume suitable for all beautiful souls."

I cannot for the life of me get any sort of rubber note but I cant fault the balance of notes. Some people are head over heels in love with this perfume - but if they ever get a chance to own Midnight In Paris especially in EDP form it’ll blow them away - it’s almost like (and I don’t like to say it) Black Bulgari is a clone of MIP with everything turned down and quite frankly poor performance. I own both so can compare side by side. Its worth buying a bottle now as prices will no doubt skyrocket as it’s discontinued"

How can a fragrance be so formal yet so badass?

Whatever bottle I purchased has the strength of an eau de cologne, but I LOVE this fragrance. I don't care if I have to unload 10 sprays onto my clothing to get weak projection, moderate performance and have to buy a new bottle every month ($45AUD 75ml). Totally worth it in my opinion. From what I can gather this has been discontinued and I am probably holding onto the last whispers of a reformulation. If you've experienced it previously it's probably safe to assume that this is a shadow of its former self, but as a newbie I am deeply in love.

If anyone knows of any other fragrance that has this burnt-tire note with a sweet boozy vanilla backing (but with better performance) please let me know!"
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","For a house that does relatively safe fragrances, this one pushes out the boat. There is undoubtedly a burnt rubber note on the initial spray. A little like the smell you may remember from slamming on your brakes a little too hard. But that dissipates pretty quickly to become a warm smoky vanilla, leather, and woody scent. Really challenging at first, but not in a bad way, to become a really versatile cooler weather fragrance. Really good and not sure why I didn’t purchase it years ago. Blind buy? If you like vanilla, leather, and woods, absolutely.

It’s like a leathery (or rubbery) vanilla that I think would smell good on anyone. It’s got that uniqueness factor which sets it apart from other designer scents but also has enough familiarity as well. It’s not a heavy scent either imo. I wonder how the newest formulation compares.

Most people glom onto the initial rubber note, and I understand why--it's a fascinating way to kick things off. The drydown brings in the more conventional accords of green tea, musk, vanilla, and some vaguely woody notes. I was expecting something a bit more aggressive and enigmatic, but this is still a very unique scent. I wouldn't even say that it smells ""good"" on my skin, but elicits more of a ""ooh, what is that?"" reaction in me. I wish there was a parfum version of this because I'd be all over that. As others have mentioned, the sillage is on the weaker side but it does stick to the skin for a good few hours."

You can certainly see where Van Cleef & Arpels got their inspiration from, huh? Upon first spray, this immediately reminded me of MiP. MiP even has that rubbery note, though nowhere near as pronounced as the one found in Black.

I love the intense rubber in the opening, it really sets this apart. A beautiful tea note encased in vanilla. This is good stuff."

And ye Gods, I adore it. Smoky, deep, flawless, complex, soft but dark... it makes my heart beat faster. It's so gorgeous, it hurts.

Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","I loved smellysmello's description of this as an 'accessible weirdo'. Hits the nail right on the head. hannahwdraws said it pretty well in her review as well; it's weird and edgy, yes, but it doesn't scream. It's quiet and rather content in its weird little corner, just doing its thing. It doesn't hit you over the head with its weirdness, it's subtle and understated.

I think pretty much everything that can be said about this has already been said. It opens very rubbery indeed which quickly dries down to a soft vanilla leather. I find it quite jarring in that its leather note is so very reminiscent of rubber and yes, I do get the car tyre smell from it too, but I'm unsure of whether this is an objective observation or a subjective one as I had read reviews describing it as such before smelling it. I suppose I'll never know.

I could see this working very well for edgy youngsters, the kind who listen to grunge and punk rock but who don't feel the need to remind the world of this every chance they get by wearing mohawks or excessive studs or something like that. This is for the more subtle among them, the kind who just go their own way, no matter what anyone else thinks. This is a truly individualistic scent.

Sillage is polite but definitely there, longevity could probably be better. It's one of a kind, androgynous and hard to pin down. Surprisingly - though a scent I'd describe as 'warm' rather than 'cold' - this works quite well in summer.

I'm not sure yet if I can become friends with this, if I'm willing to take the risk of others perceiving me as smelling like a car tyre. I'm not sure if I'm cool enough for Black. But it's definitely a 90's gem, a true embodiment of that decade's Zeitgeist and perfume culture. A must try.

Tiny edit after prolonged wearing: this is perfect for layering scents. Just a bit of this on top of any scent you like but feel misses a bit of edge, will make it perfect. On its own as well, this is an absolute compliment magnet. Have had numerous people ask me what I'm wearing whenever I've worn Black on its own or layered with Trussardi My Name."

This is an absolutely fantastic fragrance and so glad I added to my collection. The leather, vanilla, amber and other notes are blended well. It has decent projection and longevity, although I think Bentley's Absolute may beat this one in terms of performance overall. This has a bit of powder but not overbearing, and this has a dry sweetness, not sickly, gooey, candy sweet by any means. If you like leather and vanilla you'll love this fragrance too! 10 / 10 for me!"
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","My absolute favorite scent just overall not just as a perfume. I would use this as a body wash, room spray, detergent, anything. I say that also because the longevity on this perfume is noooooot good at all. It's down to pleasant powdery vanilla in a few hours. Its a nice enough vanilla but god... that opening hour of fresh leather and rubber is heavenly and makes me want to go back for more.

It is so lovely because yes it is dark and edgy but it doesn't sacrifice comfort for bravado. It is still warm and luxurious like it doesn't need to put up an aggressive front to prove how cool it is: it knows how cool it is and has relaxed into it.

A lovely bottle reminiscent of a tire and a good representation of the smell. It might look hard and masculine but is softer to the touch and more feminine than you may think."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","One of my first perfume loves so I'll add to the many reviews.

Bvlgari Black is an accessible weirdo of a perfume. Although it has (to my mind) a masculine burnt rubber opening, I find the drydown of vanilla, tea and bergamont to be harmonious and genderless.

It's hard to believe this was created as a department store mass-market fragrance - it has a quirky, niche sensibility. It's unexpected yet still easy to wear. There's a nice balance of badass and humor with this one.

I hear it's been discontinued, which is a real shame. I see it regularly on the grey market for under $40. If you are one of the few who hasn't yet tried it, get this 90s masterpiece while you can. You won't regret it."

Although many consider it to be more masculine due to the aroma of ""burnt rubber"" in the opening, I feel it as pleasant, sexy and a woman.
I think it is the first designer perfume that dared to step on the territory of niche perfumes. Especially in the 1998s when the vast majority of houses launched fresh perfumes or in general ""safes"".
The unique smell of leather, vanilla, tea and that rubber accord ... wow ... a scent craze.
Too bad the projection was poor, otherwise it was on the podium."

Longevity is not great, it quickly dries down and after 2-3 it can barely smell it, what a shame.

I’ve also tried Prada Luna Rossa Black and they smell identical but since Prada Luna Rossa Black is a EDP it lasts longer on me and Prada Luna Rossa feels more refined as well.

But 75ml for $40 then I think it’s okay"

Upon the initial spray, I recognized the familiarity as my mom used to wear this in my teen years. For this reason, I'll forever associate this fragrance with her.

It's a beautiful soft rubbery vanilla with leather, with a nice shot of bergamot in the opening. This is very inoffensive, yet has character. I wish it were stronger on the sillage, other than that, this is a gem of a fragrance."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","This is my first run with Bvlgari Black, with a single spray to the back of each hand this morning. My 5ml sample has been settling since arriving in the mail 3 days ago.

Straight off there's a shot of bergamot, unfolding into a lightly sweet and spicy scent. I get no rubber or smoke, which I'm more than okay with, but there is an edginess to this fragrance that I'm loving. This is definitely a unisex fragrance, a type of fragrance to which I'm still fairly unaccustomed, however this a great initiation and a very nice offering.

Looking at the note pyramid above, I'd say that I'm mostly picking up on the vanilla, sandalwood, musk and just a hint of rose. It's quite strong too (1hr).

After 5 hrs I can't say that I've noticed much change since the initial application except to say it's now softer, with perhaps a stronger vanilla and less of the earlier spiciness. So far I've not picked up any leather either, but with several more wears it may reveal more of itself. Upon a 2nd application this afternoon to my chest and cleavage, the citrus is more obvious to my nose this time. I have to say that Bvlgari Black is simply a gorgeous fragrance and one that perhaps responds well with a little more heat.

This is a really sexy, modern, niche-type scent. And absolutely FB worthy for me.

EDIT: picked up a new 75ml bottle for a very reasonable price and couldn't be happier. I love this one!"

The problem is I can barely smell it after about 20 minutes. It seems to last a long time in the dry down, which is quite soft, mostly sweet. But I love that smoky, rubber scent with the first spray.

Bottle Design: Thierry de Baschmakoff

Scentrack: Khruangbin – Mr. White

Composed by Annick Menardo and released in 1998, Bvlgari Black was a trailblazer in the fragrance world. I do not know the actual reactions in 1998, but it seems to me Black grew into one of the cornerstones of modern perfumery. A true legend. At this moment it is sad to hear the growing rumors that Black is being discontinued, but it is more than possible that another of our fragrance heroes is going to be euthanized.
Why do I appreciate Black so highly? First of all, it smells niche before the niche. It was very brave of Bvlgari to release something so novel in 1998. Black is an urban unisex fragrance that reminds me of a sunset in a city. Dusky, melancholic, but somehow still realistic. It opens with just a hint of citrus, and immediately goes to the beautiful rubber eraser accord that reminds of my school days. This rubber accord is additionally deepened by a comforting vanilla-amber-Tonka combo with a hint of leather. Juxtaposed to rubber and vanilla is a sparkling (almost peppery) green tea accord that gives the whole other dimension to the composition. Strange how these completely different tunes are coherent in this composition. Later this similar theme was replayed in Body Kouros (YSL, Annick Menardo), Midnight in Paris (VC&A, Olivier Polge), Luna Rossa Black (Prada, Daniela Andrier).
The composition seems simple and linear, but still possesses several somber layers. Black is perfect to wear with a leather jacket, while strolling in a city. The performance is mediocre, while I remember it back in a day as a more potent fragrance. Still, hoping that Bvlgari will not discontinue this dark urban gem for the sake of generations to come

It opens with a strong scent of burnt tires which then mellows as the vanilla picks up, and dries down to a vanilla-tea mix. The projection is soft, but it lasts quite a while (so far, about 5 h), though out in the cold it completely shuts down, so I guess it works better during the autumn or spring. Will definitely go to my to-buy list, especially now that it has been discontinued.

March 2020 update: I bought the bottle during the winter but was waiting for spring to see how it worked in a warmer weather. The rubbery aspect is much more emphasized, softly projecting after a couple of hrs. I sprayed it on my partner too, and he's liking it (which is quite unusual, since he doesn't like to wear perfume). I'm super happy to have bought this before the prices went crazy. Do so too, if you're into edgy scents.

Well, after 5 minutes of coughing up scrap tire smoke off of my lungs, Bulgari Black told me that YES, it does. It starts with the turbo whistle of a dry, carbonized vanilla darkened by the jazz club-to campfire smoke of lapsang souchong and a lot of asphaltic sweetness from violet leaf, dressed in that modern urban uniform, the black leather jacket, one that has been dragged through the pavement and accessorized with cigarette burn holes. A breakbeat of latex and babypowder similar to the one in Habanita softens the testosterone of the leather though remaining androginous-to-masculine in the fragrances-girlfriends-steal-from-boyfriends category, and a disturbing erotic character, sexual, suggestively.

It smells like an epistle from the urban youth of the XX century fin-de-siècle: EDM, inner-city raves, Y2K, the aggressive search for individualism, Fight Club, the surge of the worldwideweb, surviving the howling mob of metropolis and other concerns-du-jour of the time that in part trespassed barriers of millennia and remain to this day. There's a very individualistic not-playing-by-your-rules, dark and unrewarded by society Byronic hero theme scripting this. And Bvlgari Black was unrewarded at the end by being discontinued, and what a shame it was because this fragrance symbolizes what designer fragrances should ideally be about: a democratized, accessible avant-gardism that caresses on the cutting-edge without going full-tilt on it like niche."

I'm very pleased I got my hands on this. I do wish that it developed more on my skin than I've experienced.
I'm going to give it a shot in different times of the year to see if it wears differently.

EDIT: I think my disappointment with this perfume is that I get none of the interesting notes that are listed and people talk about. To me there's no tea, no leather, no rubber, just a flat vanilla and not a very interesting vanilla at that. I'm going to stick with Shalimar or Jicky or Chopard Casmir for a better vanilla fix."

Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","The discontinuation of this little gem made me bought a bottle. I remember having smelled this one back when I started my journey in 2015 and liking it. At the time i bought the also discontinued Midnight in Paris and though that this would had been a redundant purchase.

4 years later, I purchased it just to see if this is really that similar or not and because it could had been the last opportunity before prices go crazy. I'm a huge Annick Ménardo fan and this fragrance is really one of their best creations, imo.

This is a very linear fragrance to start off. It starts off with the rubber accord that combines tea leafs, bergamot and a leather accord.
After an hour, this accord starts to mellow out and the vanilla became the king here. It has the MiP vibe but, imo, much better made. Instead of the tonka this one has vanilla and is more creamy and less aromatic than MiP which has an excellent note of Rosemary, by the way. Although this is more linear.

All in all, this is an excellent scent and I'm glad that I have a bottle. Super unisex and pleasant scent.
Longevity is pretty good. I get 10 plus hours on my skin, but the projection is very moderate in the first 2hours and close to the skin in the rest of the lifetime.
I give this one a 4/5 stars."

That's basically the aroma of Black, yes it has an addition of vanilla but sometimes sweet black tea smells vanillic to me.

Longevity is around 6 hours, sillage is medium.

Just sexy, for men or women."

If Eric Draven wore a perfume, that could be Bvlgari Black and since I love ""The crow"", let's analyze Eric Draven's character:
Dark but Sweet;
Apparently he is a devil but inside he is an angel;
This perfume is exactly like this. Considering the fact that BB was born to represent the dark atmosphere of the big cities (think NY, TOKYO, LA ...) I would say that Annick Menardo succeeds great but it's not over here: I did a research and guess what .. .It's one of ANGELINA JOLIE's favorite perfumes!And it was not to be expected from a girl with her character.
The fragrance is magnetic, intriguing with green tea and leather in a vanilla frame. The amber is also very good, and despite its non-cloying sweetness the soul of this perfume is sad, melancholy, like an urban Encre Noire. One of my favorite fragrances.

As it stands, the rubber is nothing to be worried about. On the whole, this is a gorgeous, cozy smell with hints of various isolated accords which do their own thing - the sheer sweetness of vanilla, wafts of jasmine, sparks of rubberiness and some tea popping up once in a while.

Longevity wise, you get whiffs for about 6 hours, projection stays around an arms length for 1-2 hours. I use it as a nighttime scent at home and it always has a lovely, calming effect."

Bulgari Black reminds me of opening a new action figure toy as a child. Just like opening the plastic cover and smelling that all-too-familiar strong rubber scent from that He-Man figure. It's like smelling the rubber kickball at school. What's so interesting to me is being able to wear that smell. Of course, there are various notes in there to make it smell pleasant, and most everyone here loves this fragrance. Just like many others, I was also confused by this scent when I first sampled it at the store. When I saw a small bottle for sale at a discount, I bought it ($25) and gave it another try. I really do like it, but its performance is lacking. There isn't much projection, and it's a light skin scent after two hours. That actually is a benefit because I live in Japan, where people don't like smelling cologne (they find it offensive, yet smoking indoors is okay...go figure). I don't think this is a woman's fragrance; that rubber smell maybe too odd/strong a note for a female. Also, I love how the bottle has a rubber ring around it."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Bvlgari Black is another Annick Menardo creation I have stumbled across. Unfortunately, I don't love this creation like I love some of the others (Eg. Au Masculin) and I barely ever reach for it.

At the opening, there is a prominent tea note with vanilla and leather. Agree with others that the opening reminds me of rubber/fresh tires with vanilla. The vanilla for me is a cheapish vanilla scent which can be compared to cheap vanilla car air fresheners or cleaning products. This ruins the fragrance for me.

The fragrance is pretty linear too and doesn't change much into the drydown.

Projection is fairly weak and longevity is average for me. It's pretty much a skin scent after the opening and lasts about 2-3 hours on my skin.

Bit disappointed given the hype and perfumer. Best try before you buy and judge for yourself.

It is not a strong scent, but it projects more than one would expect, and also lasts for a while.

I don't think it's a safe blind buy. I bought it blindly and happened to enjoy it and appreciate it a lot, but I could see a lot of people being grossed out by it. It's really a weird, unisex scent. In my opinion, it's not perfumey or cologney in nature. It does have that ""mmm, grrr..."" factor. I would love this on a female, like many of the fragrances I've written reviews for here.

I rarely feel like wearing this but when I do it's not something anything else in my collection can fill. Best matched with synthetic fabrics and dark colours. Great for lovers of the Y2K aesthetic."

Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Modern, mysterious, soft and seductive. This was way ahead of its time. Such a buttery vanilla with a velvety new tire smell. I was anticipating a cumbersome, jarring and sharp latex note, but that’s far from the truth. I find this fragrance actually quite welcoming and warm rather than industrial.

I do wish it carried on longer. It projects only a few inches from the skin, even upon initial application. Sillage follows you very closely as well. After about 2 hours it’s practically non-existent on me. However, the price is right for the pleasure of having it in my collection. For quiet date-nights or close encounters, this would fit the bill nicely."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","yeah, really not digging this. To me it smells like furniture cleaner with a really strong ''rubber'' smell."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","First initial wearing —

I was very shocked at how good this scent is ! With all the reviews saying this had a very off putting ,burning rubber ,tire smell I was expecting a very unique but daring smell. That assumption was partly correct but that tire smell on my skin smells like a very clean tire shop or the smell of the interior of a new car. In fact, this is a different scent than the typical freshies out there but it’s very pleasing to my nose.

This opens up with that tire smell but then quickly transitions to a fresh,leathery smell thats rich,sensual and actually smells kind of like a luxurious soap. I get a lot more tea than most are mentioning and also in the drydown I also get a clean marshmallow vibe like the reviewer below stated. I’m really digging this in the colder weather and it’s also very relaxing to my nose.

Performance on the first wearing was slightly disappointing as it’s a great smell but doesn’t project very much. It does leave a nice Sillage trail though which is the strength of this fragrance. It only lasted me about 5 hours which is average.

Overall rating— 7.5 out of 10 ! Unique and pleasant scent but it loses points with performance.

In comparisons to midnight in Paris I would say they are very similar but Bvlgari Black is more rich,less powdery and more masculine. However,I don’t think Prada Black is very similar to Bvlgari Black in terms of smell but they do have a similar vibe.

Fiancées thought— she thought it was pleasant but nothing special. Also she thought it kind of smelled like a shoe store but it was still nice.lol"

Certain occasions when you’re bored want an aura change but keep it subtle.
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Another scent I had been meaning to buy for a long while. The first spritz tingles my nose with its alcohol component. Within one minute I get a big hit of vanilla (that came quick!). There is no trace of that humid rubbery goodness I had noticed from a test years before (had it been reformulated?). I really have to imagine it being there. I try again later and that rubber characteristic is faintly there, but only lasts for a few minutes. After half an hour I smell an interesting wet clean smell, almost powdery - it smells good on my skin. Dry down is ambiguous; slightly floral or grassy, powdery, vanilla. The projection on this frag is terrible. After three minutes or so I can barely smell it two inches from my skin. Longevity is okay, maybe four hours.

Update: Weird - after trying this scent on and off for a while somedays I get that rubbery note. Today I am wearing it and it smells especially good."

Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","I got a 40Ml bottle of this legendary and now discontinued fragrance online for a song. Worth it for the splendid rubber slick-tyre enclosed bottle alone. I sprayed it with some excitement and not a little caution expecting a great roar. What I got instead is a very beautiful balance between a slight rubber and something grassy and citrus inclined. The opener also reminded me of my grandmother's garage in the 1960s which never housed a car but had a combined smell of petrol lawnmower, creosote, cobwebs and now long-banned garden chemicals. This odd note quickly disappears and it continues in a very civilized but altogether low-key way. The main thing which confounded expectations for me is just how faint the rubber accord actually is. In the film Fantastic Voyage a nuclear submarine is miniaturised and injected into a scientist's brain so that it can seek out and destroy a blood clot, save the scientist and the secrets he carries with him. If you imagine putting Santa Pod Drag Racetrack into the same machine and then hiding the result an a little wheel-shaped bottle you have Black."

10/10 for me"
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","The fragrance starts off with a burnt and biting scent, seemingly characteristic for rubber containing high amounts of plasticisers. Albeit not identical, the smell of the rubber covering the flanker can be taken as a point of reference. I do not know whether this is intentional or whether it has to do with a reformulation. These plasticisers, certain types of phthalates, are harmful to our health and they are increasingly recognised as environmental toxins. It then develops or weakens into something which is less biting, more round to some extent and reminiscent or remotely reminiscent of almonds for some reason. I would describe this as a lighter violet in colour. The sweetness which accompanies the rubber element might have proven rather interesting on its own or in an altered composition. Through the rubber, the fragrance seems to attempt to inspire an urban romanticism, but in contrast to what is claimed in the marketing description, wearing a scent of sweetened plasticisers seems neither rebellious nor sensual but rather senseless to me. And this is politely speaking, my first reaction was that it is a perverse expression of human recklessness raising questions about worthiness and survival. I think of it as a debatable artistic statement and this makes it hard for me to recognise it as a masterpiece. Not that I have anything in particular against the perfumer or the commissioning company, I mentioned that there seems to lie potential in the sweet element of the fragrance. However, I believe that they, as well as those who follow along without too much thought, need to be held accountable in a certain sense."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","It may be the case that there is nothing new to say about Bvlgari Black. I'm another person showing up to sing its praises--

This was a very lucky blind buy. About twenty minutes in, I'm fascinated by how this one is kinky, cozy, and wholesome all at the same time. Underneath the shell of so-delicious-that-they-seem-edible rubber and leather there is a warm-blanket, powdery core that smells like laundry right out of the dryer, emphasis on the heat! I don't mean a clean laundry musk, but rather that cozy, fuzzy smell."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","I had heard a lot about this ""rubbery"" wonder, so I wanted to try it out... and the result was it blew my mind. The rubber note is right there at the opening, very organic and not ""plasticky"" at all, yet modern and edgy, reminiscent of 20th Century machinnery. Then there's the leather, like expensive italian leather goods, not outdoorsy or animalistic, refined, polished. For a sweet note, deep, whisper soft vanilla. And the shadow of a drop of resinous cedar.
The last traces of dryout keep very close to the skin, and do not last too long, so I would suggest to have an extra spray on your lapels or a scarf.
On a man I would consider this an alluring scent, for a woman, this is the perfect power scent: strong, out of the ordinary and just the right amount of subtle."

That's not a bad thing, I think it smells good."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Maybe this scent has been reformulated ? When I first tested Bvlgari Black in a store several years ago, the first spray was a blast of fresh new tires smell, like walking into a store that sells brand new tires. It's NOT burning rubber, just fresh new rubber. The first spray died down within a minute, and the rest of the fragrance was a very airy, feminine sweet powder with aromatic leather. Nice !

I love my current bottle, even though it lacks the initial strong fresh rubber scent blast. The leather is rich, smooth, excellent, stays through out the dry down. This newer formula lacks the sweet powder of the original. Wish it projected more.. It's almost a skin scent on me after about a half hour. Still, it's pretty, slightly sweet and sultry on my skin and lasts about 6 hours easily.

I wear Bvlgari Black day or night, any time of year. OK for office wear, since it's non offensive, unisex and unique. It's also the only Bvlagri scent that lasts on my skin."

It is a masterpiece and I especially love the top notes and it is extremely pleasing in the 1st 30 min of wearing. It is certainly unisex and in fact it leans toward being femine after the initial petrol smell is gone. For me that makes it a 'home fragrance' that I am not willing to really wear outside.

I have to say that despite its magical scent, performance is terrible and it becomes a skin scent very quickly. In that sense it certainly is a short-lived beauty.

I LOVE it. I had been on the look out for it and managed to find it in a small perfume outlet. When I sprayed the tester on myself i didn't know what to think of it initially. It confused me. I let it settle and I could smell the rubbery note, but it was so subtle. Then I started to detect the note of tea and vanilla. It was so puzzling but uniquely good I had to buy it. Now that I have worn it a number of times, I am soo glad I have this in my collection. There is something kinky and dirty about Bvlgari Black; but not in an in-your-face way. It's simultaneously delicate and earthy. It has this natural quality to it - almost like the way someone's natural skin may smell. It wears very close to the skin. The rubbery note is profound, but I love it, and I feel sexy every time I can smell it in the initial spray. My boyfriend finds it very sexy when I wear it. I love wearing it on a rainy or foggy day, or whenever I'm feeling a bit sassy and moody. I cannot say enough good things about this perfume - it's so grungy and magnificently alluring."

This is absolutely AMAZING. I had read all those reviews here and it was literally a blind buy.

Not really strong, not really overpowering, just a comfort herbal burning plastic vanilla that blows my mind. I really love it! To be honest I thought that this might be a bit strong, too wintery but this is not the case. It is almost summer here in Greece and this one performs really nice, being airy and comforting. It is not an overstatement to say that this is niche quality - an amazing release from Bvlgari!

Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']",After so many years of reading good reviews about it I finally decided to add Black to my perfume collection. In his guide Luca Turin gave it a 5 stars rating but named it hot rubber...I hate the smell of rubber and certainly don't want to smell rubber. I though Black will be strange and not wearable. It's not the case at all. Black is different but really beautiful. On my skin I don't detect any trace of rubber like Tar by Comme des garçons. It's soft but at the same time have a strong presence and personality. Absoluty no trace of flowers in it. Very urban. I like it.
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","I always thought that loving a perfume meant that I would automatically want to wear it.

With time, I've noticed that there are certain scents that I admire greatly, while not really ever wanting to wear.

Bvlgari Black is one of them. It is seriously one of the most unique perfumes I've ever tried: a bitter powdery, rubbery leather, with a smoky vanillic amber halfway between Shalimar and l'Air du Desert Marocain. It has this herbal greeness to it that really makes it shimmer throughout the day.

But I just can't imagine myself putting it on. For as brilliant as I find its composition, I don't really think it would ever suit me.

Who knows! Maybe I'm just too much of a traditionalist.

Either way, Black is weird and wonderful, and would go great on somebody who is likewise weird and wonderful."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Bvlgari's Black is very nice - a great unisex gourmand combination of soft vanilla and smooth leather, very likeable and comfortable. It's just a solid like for me, however: leather is a note that I rarely dislike but only sometimes love, and then most often when it's combined with (stone) fruits or floral notes, so it's no surprise that this one doesn't quite make my heart beat any faster.

I could have chosen a much better day to test it than this almost summery day in April, though: it's the kind of comforting scent that's obviously made for colder, darker weather. So I'll revisit my little decant again next winter, and who knows, I might still fall in love with it then."

But..it's hard to wear. I think it's more suited for a woman but yes a man can wear it easily. The only thing is that although i really like it, I just don't reach for it as much as I should.

Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Black is a perfume by Bvlgari brand known for their 19-century jewelry. It appeared on the market in 1998 and is one of the most avant-garde perfumes ever. It was designed by Annick Menardo, one of my favorite perfume creators ever, with such creativeness and refinement in mixing the unmixable that Bvlgari Black, one of my favorite perfumes ever, can be seen as a genius perfume and work of art.

Black is a simple, linear perfume but it is not striving to be any different. Like black and white photos, the colors are scarce but the emotion is more alive, direct and dynamic. All the notes open at once, warm vanilla and a dry scent of new tires. Its a punch and a dare for every nose, but a punch you don’t want to recover from. Try it on your skin despite being skeptical over the scent of a tire on the skin. When you put that aside, you will notice that something is constantly forcing you to smell the perfume on your skin.

There is something animal, intoxicating in this perfume. It’s a bit perverse. Ok, it's quite perverted.

This is a perfume Anastasia and Mr. Grey would wear if the book and the movie had any substance. But because they don’t we imagine them sprayed with sugary water. Black is not sugar water and it cannot be used by everybody. It requires a leather jacket or pants, dark sunglasses, bed hair and the “I don’t give a damn” attitude. It’s ideal for modern rebels. Disobeying the rules (in school, work or bed) never smelled better.

It is designed as a perfume for men but its nature is unisex. It has a small aura and a sillage but it stays long on skin and is meant for you and anyone who dares to gets close to half a meter from you. There are no rules when to wear it, just wear it freely and without limitations. We make our own rules and break them. And smell phenomenal along the way."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Bulgari Black is fun because it has multiple meanings for me. I was a teenager in Tokyo in the mid-2000s so I can't quite shake the association of Black with sleazy guys who hung around Shibuya and Roppongi with their creepily thin eyebrows and pointy shoes. When perfume and mean-funny Turin reviews became a mild obsession in my mid twenties, I bought a decant of Black and my first reaction to it was ""ew, I remember this"".
It only took three wears before repulsion turned to love - it was like that with Palazzo. With Lolita lempicka it was two wears; with Patchouli24 maybe three. Annick Menardo has a way of messing with the edible and inedible - at first it can be confusing but if you know perfume then you'll know it's special."

Now I got a sample couple days ago - I had difficulity opening the vial, once I did I accidentally dropped it where it fell to the ground and spilled all over the floor- so I guess this will be my first and last time trying this out.


it's basically like you've morphed into a leather couch for the first couple minutes - but then it mellows down to a more vanilla black rubber scent.
It's interesting for sure- BUT..... I wouldn't get it to wear personally , though.

Very weak sillage and longevity, it's been a couple hours and I can barely detect on me right now

This states it is unisex, but I feel like it's more of a men's scent than anything- a very strong type of woman can pull this off too probably."

I cannot believe I'm just now discovering this and its been out since the late 90s, which is when I started becoming overly obsessed with perfumes. It seems like this perfume smells somewhat gourmand or like an oriental vanilla, to my nose, and seems way more feminine than I thought it would be before I got it. I wish the sillage was stronger, I find myself spraying all over myself and my clothes, at least 10 times! But hardly anyone can smell it. I received my first compliment yesterday about how good I smelled! It wasn't overpowering they said, because i asked, they could just smell a little yumminess when I walked past their desk. The way I'm going, using so much, I feel I'll be buying a new bottle every couple months! But considering its not overly expensive I don't mind. :-) If anyone knows of another scent that is very similar to this one but with way more sillage I'd love to know about it. I recently purchased Tokyo Milk Dead Sexy because its noted here that its similar. It is similar but I don't find myself using it as much because there's just something different about it I can't put my finger on.

No...but it does carry an attitude with it. You definitely have to be in a certain ""mood"" for this one. I'll probably end up spritzing whenever I feel a tad grungy and sassy.

On me, I tested my new bottle on my wrist yesterday at 8pm, and now it is 2pm the next day and I can still smell the leather-vanilla drydown faintly. Sillage is soft though.

Opening, some say bandaids. Some say freshly opened condoms. i say, the prevailing opinion, its like new tires. Think a brand new BMW, fresh tires and a hint of new car scent. Luxury sports car. That's the opening.

Now lets imagine this in a scenario. Some high-roller is cruising around in his new car until the 10 min mark when he picks up either an S.O. or someone else who has certain intentions in mind and they are wearing cheap vanilla perfume.

Tires, new car scent, and cheap vanilla.

Then at the 30 min point they get out at their destination: an executive suite at some fancy af hotel. They get out of the car, and the tires fade. In fact, the tires and new car sent evolve into a dry smoky leather. The vanilla in this executive suite changes from a cheap sweet vanilla to a more light, high quality vanilla. And this is how the scent stays. Classy, sensual, leather-vanilla. Unisex in the manner it smells feminine on a lady and masculine on a guy.

In short, start off as a fancy car with two horny people in it, turns into a classy scent for doing the do.

Unique in the opening, unique in the drydown (except for maybe Midnight In Paris, but I have not nosed that). Give it a shot! I like it a lot."

The issue with Black though, is the initial blast - and lingering scent of new tires/old band aid smell - you remember the old Johnson & Johnson band aids, came in the metal tin, and the strip was this flexible, rubbery stuff? Exact. Same. Smell."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Love it! Was a little worried about all this talk about rubber. Not really looking to smell like a walking tire, but turned out to be not a problem at all. What I get is this clean, powdery vibe that I enjoy very much. I was able to get a whiff of the rubber, but I found it very understated. It was an undercurrent that prevented the powder from becoming too girly or baby's bottom. The overall effect is comforting and, yet, sexy - if that makes sense...Good longevity, ok sillage. From the back and forth reviews, recommend you try before you buy."

Bvlgari Black lacks the magic I've fallen in love with in LLaM. It lacks the licorice and the right kind of powder. It lacks a connection, a story to tell me.

On paper, this reads like my dream fragrance. Unisex with tea AND vanilla? Leather and rose? Woods? Amber? Sign me up! Somewhere it falls flat.

Maybe it's not fair because I have Lolita Lempicka to compare it so closely. Or perhaps it's because I've only given this a chance on Casual Fridays, when a carefully chosen outfit can't elevate the notes and evoke a certain mood.

I'm going to give this one time to reveal itself to me, but for now it's just ""nice."""

I instantly loved it to death! Why? Because of the car workshop scents - gasoline, rubber, motor oil, exhaust and so on. I found this perfume to be the best ever. But after two or three bottles, I eventually got tired of it, and could not use it anymore. It also became hard to find.

I can't say I remember the other notes. But it was a sweetness there, yes. And wood.

Bvlgari Black is a unique creation, really fabulous! I still miss the very masculine scent, or opening, like if you just had been in a garage and repaired cars for hours.

It's warm, dark and sexy.
Kind of making me think about a person who smokes cigarettes,
wearing a leather jacket, drinking some warm vanilla coffee drink of some sort. It's just lovely to me.
""Cigarettes smells bad"", yes, well I am just thinking of a smoky leather. It's just my fantasy going off.

Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Some fragrances are not ment to be categorized in the ususal way as male, female, orinental, aquatic and whatnot.
They're conceptual, ment to convey a specific theme or atmosphere.
The grandaddy of this kind is Dior's Fahrenheit, which was an avantgarde thing, concentrated on the idea of burning petrol, flame and finally smoldering ashes.
Fahrenheit was a hit, not because of the idea behind it, but because it was something completely different from what is the norm, or general mass appeal, as parfumes are primarily a business aimed at a wide audience, and common places are a sure bet in revenue terms.
To create and launch a conceptual fragrance, the house must be already strong enough in market terms, so it doesn't hurt the overall business if it flops.
There's a limited number of houses that can afford to do something like that, and lucky for us, Bvlgari is one of these.
Riding on massive successes as Aqva, Pour Homme, Blv, and Jasmin noir
they can indulge themselves sometimes and not be afraid of experimenting.
Black is a concept fragrance, it plays to the limited crowd who like the smell of rubber and it wants to evoke a racing track feel.
Whoever attended a, say, Formula one, event knows the smell of burned rubber and hot asphalt, mixed with the smell of gasoline and sweet beverages and feminine parfumes.
Black gets it to the very point that once a friend of mine tought we skidded whilst driving when he cought a wiff of this. It's a work of pure art if U ask me, as even Fahrenheit, to which this is sort of a companion piece, doesn't get the burning petrol feel quite like this catches the rubber.
Mind me, it's quite more than the rubber, as the feeling is softened by the vanilla and the feeshnes of the tea note, but the leather in this is so well configured that it actually smells like you just finished a lap on Nurmbergring and just popped a soft slightly sweet drink just sitting there on the hud of the car and chilling.
Performance is fantastic on the vintage ones (if you can find them), not bad on the slightly older and, unfortunately, rather weak on the newer ones. I have a stock of 2002 and 2004 batches, and it goes easily for 8 to 10 hours with 3 of strong projection and marvelous sillage. The newer ones are 1/3 weaker. Still, this has to be tried by every serious fragrance fan and it's a must in every collection as things like this in Fragworld are rare.
Unique and excellent.
A gem.
Absolute A, one of the few."

Black also so close to V&A Midnight In Paris but more masculine, I sold my MIP because it was too feminine and creamy for me and got bvl Black instead. My only complain is about performance is so weak, after one or more hour it dissapears, starts like it ll raze everything to the ground and vanishes quickly. Yet, a wonderful smell, I can say a masterpiece. Annick Menardo, amazing nose <3"

I don't think it is masculine at all, I find it very feminine which clashes with many reviews here. I wonder if there is a dude who can pull this off... so tomorrow I am spraying all my work colleagues :'D with it.

Very nicely powdery, vanilla and amber. I was playing with Hiris earlier and Hiris is way more masculine imo. Weird that there is no iris note in Black, it would totally match.The rubber note is only noticeable on my skin up close. It is an original scent and I can only recommend it.

Wow! seriously!"

Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Unlike its bottle, Bvlgari Black is soft and sensuous and not as avant garde as the bottle may have suggested. The low sillage makes it appropriate for daytime wear, but the scent profile is more of a nighttime perfume. The tea note in this perfume and its overall aesthetic is very reminiscent of the au the series (au the rouge, au the blanc). The difference is that this perfume have a leather accord in addition to tea. I would say this is more tame than au the noir, which is more peppery. Bvlgari Black is for rough and tough cats who are soft at heart."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","I have a bottle of Black, with the On/Off cap that does not come off. So I think it's pre-2009?

But even pre-2009, I still find this lacking in potency/sillage and the lasting power is okay- but light.

I really dig this tho. For what it is... I'm in love with it. It's a fairly basic (generic?) vanilla/leather/rubber with a tea-like dryness. I find it pretty feminine. It's not complicated, but it's somewhat unique for being basic. I'm happy with it."

I just purchased Black at Ross for a decent price. I have held off purchasing it because of the elusive ""rubber tire"" scent...and while I do get that accord shortly after, it fades and this is just a lovely slightly smokey hot steamy cup of tea.

After it wears on, it becomes sweeter with the vanilla coming through and powdery with soft sillage and medium longevity. Very lovely and comforting I can see myself wearing this a lot this Fall and Winter cozied up to a good book or watching one of my black and white oldies by the fire cuddled up with the Hubby..so glad I bought it..."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Black is a little like a pleasant, rather insipid person wearing a very cool hat. Black's cool hat is a tarry, petrochemical note in the top that's impressively interesting and must have been unique when it first came out. After about 30 minutes, though, that fades into a friendly but very bland white musk and vanilla scent."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Bvgari Black is a fragrance i picked up at a discount store. I read the fragrantica reviews and ratings before purchasing and thought it would be a great blind buy. For me, it was a rollercoaster of emotions.

At first I did catch all the top notes but they went away pretty quickly, withing 5-10 minutes. While smelling all of the notes after initially applying Black I thought it was pretty good! Then my hopes crashed as after the top notes faded and I smelled the middle and bottom notes together I HATED this composition. It smelled like straight up tires with Armor All on them. But then, it started growing on me. After an hour or so I started to smell more of the leather instead of rubber when the amber began to play. If you like leather and/or rubber you will like this scent. I will say that the amber and a soft soft leather lasts an extremely long time and it quite beautiful.

I would only wear this in the fall and winter during the day with a leather jacket or rugged clothing. I do not think this is a fragrance that would do well in the cozy cold night unless your SO is 100% into this fragrance, as it will turn people off if they don't like it. So while I think there are better options at night, i would wear this in the evening during cold days and transition to an amber fragrance at night."

The notes and reviews didn't disappoint as this was a blind buy. This is one of my new favorites. Something really fresh about it but not in a soapy way. I haven't smelled a fragrance like it I definitely would be okay with an enjoy wearing this everyday. It's an all year around any time of the day fragrance and truly unisex. I will buy this again maybe even as a backup.
So modern to be made in 1998! Ahh why didn't I know about this before 2017.

Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","A smokey sexy rubber latex and leather aroma on top of the most beautiful soft inviting vanilla. This trio is a very hot combination if you think about it! Bvlgari Black is ""Leather for beginners"" and I do believe it's the vanilla done right that makes it so."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Black comes off like the secret fragrance love child of the elegant, modulated Bvlgari offerings and the avant garde notions of Commes Des Garcons. That smokey rubber vanilla note is just weird and industrial enough to be distinct, challenging, and memorable, but not so weird as to make the fragrance unwearable or off-putting. It finds that very, very fine line between both standing out and fitting in. Can be had at value prices and worth purchasing if for no other reason than to reward and encourage inventiveness in the mid-price designer fragrance market."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","This leans feminine on me, which is not so great since I'm a man. I like the scent, but not enough to wear it on myself. The rubber note doesn't do a lot for me, although the leather is fine.

Given this leans feminine and has a predominant rubber note, maybe it is ideal for women with a latex fetish. Or a woman who is dating a man who is obsessed with cars.

The scent is quite tenacious on my skin. Washing it off my hand with soap and water the first time only reduced its intensity by about 50%.

The bottle design is great. One of the best looking bottles I've seen. The rubber surround is great for the grip it offers too. No more dropped perfume bottles in the bathroom."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","WOW. I have never been so immediately satisfied with a blind buy. I smelled this for the first time and thought “yup. this is my signature fragrance now”. The packaging is easily the best I’ve ever seen (although that isn’t saying much considering all my fragrances are basically under $40). But seriously, the presentation is just so perfect for the fragrance and the bottle feels so nice in your hand. Unboxing this felt…spiritual

As for the smell, right off the bat it reminded me of a smoky scotch because of that smoky rubber note mixing with the alcohol smell you get in all fragrances after spraying them. Then it quickly settled into a sweet, soft, rubbery vanilla smell. It reminds me of walking into a tractor/lawnmower store but…..kinky. The rubber adds a familiar working class dirtiness but the vanilla, leather, and tea bring it into a sexual bdsm realm. This is definitely unisex. Leans more feminine to my nose but barely. A masculine person can bring out the more standard rubber vibes of this (like tires) but I think a femininity can really bring out the darker and sexier rubber vibes. This is really special stuff and I don’t see it working on everybody but if it sounds like your thing, go for it.

Is this similar to Midnight in Paris? I would say yes. They are about 85% similar to me. I find MiP to be have a bit more citrus and juicy/herbal nuances in the top, possibly a more complex fragrance overall. Black is more soft and dry. The rubber/leather notes however are basically the same in both."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Ooof... this stuff is nice. Black is a powdery vanilla leather. The leather is smooth and soft. Very different from a pungent Fahrenheit style leather. Normally I'm not into vanilla scents but this one has little to no sweetness. A musky, cedar, sandalwood base is in the mix with just a touch of florals. Taken all together I do smell some kind of rubber. I suppose the tea note plays a hand in this?

Lasts for about six hours then becomes very soft. Detectable on my clothes the next day. Sexy, sensual, date night scent; seems okay for work as well. This is unisex maybe slightly ""feminine"". Good for autumn, winter and spring. Tire/hockey puck bottle is cool and the sprayer works well. My only gripe is the box exposes the fragrance to light. Very reasonably priced but I wish it performed just a little better. Buy it!"
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']",This fragrance seriously makes my knees buckle. It's the smell of a cool clean tyre shop... an old plush leather couch ... and a hot hot hot mechanic. WOW! This is the scent of my true love. Just heaven. I remember buying this... ripping the packaging and spritzing myself while driving... only to have to hit the skids a few moments later because I lost all trane of thought. I've only smelt this on myself. Heaven help the man that walks by me wearing this. Just saying.
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Bulgari Black is an eye opener. The opening is provoking. The top only lasts for a couple of minutes. The middle is vanilla and sweat. Not Body odor sweat, but the sweat of a God or Goddess. You know that scent of glistening sweat of the person you are in love with. You crave that smell because you two are bonded together. That is what the middle reminds me of. Sweat of a lover; Sweet and dark and alluring.

I get the the rubber note at first, but it is not a harsh latex smell. I hate that smell, but Black is bitter and a little pungent like real Green Tea in Japan, not the sweetened green tea we drink here in the states. It is not unpleasant. It is mysterious and makes my nose curious for more. I am smelling my wrists and shirt all day when wearing Bvlgari Black. I am drawn to the moment by moment evolution on my skin and around me.

I was motivated to purchase this blind, based on comparisons to long lost Midnight in Paris. I am not disappointed at all. This scent is great and distinct, yet does invoke a resemblance to the the powdery affect of Midnight in Paris.
I highly recommend this and also thanks to everyone below who encouraged me to buy this with their positive reviews, accurate descriptions and experiences. This stuff really is superior and unique. The only negative is the longevity is below average on me. I get 4 or 5 hours at most from this. I would wear this year round, except for hot humid nights. It is an evening scent for me, just like Midnight in Paris."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","The reformulations simply destroyed this fragrance. What Bvlgari has done to Bvlgari Black is just as bad as what JPG did to Le Male. I used to love this perfume, now it's just a shadow of its former self. The rubber accord has been so toned down that's barely even there and that delicious vanilla is also as good as gone. Such a shame..."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Finally after a few weeks I crossed this perfume again and I bought it.
The Vanilla opening wasn't my favorite, yet it quickly disappeared and left with a rubber tea leather combo. Something that is incredible attractive to me. Warm dark and sexy, not masculine, so it's really unisex. I think it's a very good dating fragrance for men because I'm convinced women will like it....and it suits definitely cool and sexy girls on casual occassions.

I noticed it smells on girls fresher, lighter than on myself. On me it turns warm and heavy. That makes it really interesting.

Besides Dior Fahrenheit this is really a fantastic perfume for rendezvous. The Sillage and Longevity are quite poor, yet the price is low with around 30usd for 40ml as well. Reapplying or put a bit more is ok then."

Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","I recently acquired Black, after having purchased Man in Black, which is my favourite Bvlgari scent. Having read so many conflicting accounts of this perfume, I was pleasantly surprised about how mellow and smooth this scent actually is. Yes, it has a rubber accord, but it's not a burning, or tar-like smell, it's more suave man in a leather jacket or tux, or the interior of a luxury sports car. A very sumptuous affair, almost formal. I agree with the previous comments here, that one imagines a man in a classic bond-like suit, that is, it smells more expensive and regal that it costs.
I love it: it’s clean, almost powdery in the dry down, with vanilla in there, it’s sophisticated, and can be easily worn in formal gathering settings and sensual dinner dates alike. It has become my preferred Bvlgari with Man in Black, by Morillas.
In a word, if you liked Bvlgari Man in Black, Pour Homme, or Notte, you will like this fragrance, and like myself, probably love it, without a shadow of a doubt. The kind of fragrance that compliments a stylish look, and fortunately is in fact not a challenge to wear, for neither sex. Wear it on a date, wear it at home, when you just want to feel like “your worth it”. Possesses a lovely dry down, and the sillage is borderline beast. This should not be classified as a ""cult fragrance"" for a select group of perfume wearers like the way Encre Noir is; no, Black is for everybody. So get ready to tap your leather hat off to Annick Menardo and go ahead and try out this little gem from Bvlgari!"

the dry down was the only redeeming bit of the frag, but reminded me too much of Midnight in Paris, which i also wasn't a big fan off.

yeah its different and daring and i appreciate that, but smell-wise it's not for me at all.

if you're after a Bvgari scent, you can do much better then this one, in my opinion, i'd recommend, Man in Black, which is a different beast altogether."

Back in the 70s, I used, as a teenager, to drench myself in Musk by Jovan - I bought some again recently and it smells a lot like this, only better. A real disappointment. I get the faintest whiff of musk, then nothing, then another faint whiff a few hours later. Most odd."

The mix of green tea, vanilla and bergamot is divine, it makes this fragrance so relaxing, specially at cold weather!

The only problem is performance. It becomes a skin scent after 30 min.

This is the type of fragrance you'd wear for yourself, when you are reading a book, drinking a tea, etc. People around you probably won´t smell a thing after 30 min, unless it's a really intimate interaction, so it's not suitable for clubs and dating.

In a sea of Axe-imitators with over the top vetiver and musk, Bvlgari Black manages to be a daring and masculine without relying on tropes. Despite the notes to be fairly conventional, they combine to create a unique fragrance. That doesn't mean it's for everyone, or that you will like it at first sniff. I sure didn't! But every time I came back to it I smelled more and more complexity and appreciate it in a new way. On me, the leather comes out strong, and perhaps a bit too sweet. Otherwise, the composition is fairly balanced and would make an excellent unisex scent."

At times it makes me feel like I'm inside a luxury sports car, brand new, with leather seats.

I find it suitable for the most demanding public who wants a good note of leather available and without stridencies.

Black is all a basics that I use very often, is much better than many niches out there and also at a price of laughter.

Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","This is pure sex in a bottle.

I use it only for close encounters, i don't know if i would use it for a first date, maybe a date when you know you're going to be really close and you should do at least 5-6 sprays on the neck/chest area as this would not project more than 2-3 inches away from your skin for the first couple of hours.

Longeveity by the way i would say is average, you get around 5 hours before it sits as a smoky/powdery faint vanilla skin scent."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","The first time I smelled this I wasn't ready to wear it, it was ALL man--specifically a man in his 20's. Very urban outlaw. Maybe a guy who works with his hands, drives a motorcycle, and wears a leather jacket. Yeah, that type of guy that women notice. This is often a signature scent for men, but on women it takes on a bad girl whose into leather (if you get my meaning) and a little darkness. A definite mood changer. However, it's a phantom of what it once was. Bvlgari perfumes don't last on my skin anyway, but this has definitely been reformulated. I have a bottle from May 2015, and I remember smelling an entirely different scent in April of 2009.I remember the date because we visited a perfume shop while on vacation, and it had more rubber. Now it has more tea and vanilla."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Reformulated ten years ago. That's why the're so many negative reviews. It WAS rubbery, sexy, strong and very unisex. Angelina Jolie was wearing this stuff.

Nowadays: nada!"
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","The initial blasts were vanilla-heavy and a ""metropolitan bakery run by the yakuza""-accord was doing my head in. With 1/3 of the bottle destroyed a smoked tea note has emerged and it is a delightful thing to have. I honestly do not get your dirty läther fantasies at all, this is just a really laid-back scent that puts you in the zone. A bit more strength and power would be appreciated though."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","I'm having a really hard time with this one. The alcohol scent is so strong that I miss any initial scents and once its faded it smells like baby powder. If I really concentrate I can pick out the rubber and leather, but it's buried under a powdery smell that is similar to baby oil. I tried it a couple times on myself and it's all powder.

Than I had the idea to try it on my boyfriend. Mmmmm a bit of cedar and than super-vanilla. Imagine if you were to polish a nice oak cabinet with vanilla. No rubber. No leather. Sadly no delicious smokey tea. Just rich woody vanilla. It's not his taste, but I think it's yummy."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Well, Yesterday I bought this fragrance from bvlgari store at amazon.com. You smell the perfume at the first spray then it disappears. No one can notice it on you so that you don't receive any compliment. The ones who said they get compliments, I think they mean the compliments were from someone get them hugged because this is the only way you can notice it.
The smell itself looks creepy, It starts with the SANDALWOOD note then settle on LEATHER. In fact it smells like a TIRE.
I give an overall of 3 of 10"

Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","I love this unisex fragrance. The leather and rubber notes are subtle but unusual, particularly When worn by a woman.

I've just finished my second bottle of this and will be buying another as soon as I can. This has become a winter signature for me.

UPDATE
Just for the hell of it, try layering this one. I did it with Tabu 🤗"
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Ohhhh! I had a craving for this warm brooding scent for so long and didn't realize it until I bought myself a bottle. You ever have that happen? Like you crave some scent but you cant figure out what you need and then you get a hold of some juice and it's like YES! this is what I wanted. That's how I currently feel with Black. Its a grounding and comforting scent. Its smooth and luscious and round. The smokiness warms me up here in the winter months.

I notice lots of people think this is hard to wear or find it odd. I don't get that at all. It is unique for sure, but its very assessable imo. It has a niche feel to it, but it's not over the top in what it has to say.

In a nutshell Black is a dark, brooding, somewhat serious perfume. It demands confidence and surety, but at the same time it's disarming in its powdery innocence. It's a smoky, leathery, vanilla, with just the perfect amount of amber. The green tea adds just a bit of freshness to it, making it easy to wear even in the summer.

It's weird I used to wear this scent a few years ago and got away from it and now I cant figure out why. This is so me. Signature territory honestly."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","This perfume has shot to the top of my want list! Thank you no-fi for the generous sample!

On first application, there's a wall of amber and vanilla mixed with cedar on my skin. The leather is there, too and quickly rises to the forefront and says ""I'M HERE!"" in a big loud voice and then backs off a little, letting the other notes do some kind of sexy hotchpotch dance where they mingle delicately, let loose, each having a moment of attention and then join hands again in some kind of whirling dervish of notes.

Jasmine pops up, musk settles it all in a background kind of way and there's some greenery coming through too, combining amazingly with the jasmine and leather, just when I was thinking this was totally oriental! I love it! A juxtaposition of notes that work so well together and ever changing. How does Annick Menardo work this kind of magic?! Nothing vies for dominance on my skin and just when I think ok, bummer, the rubbery vanilla leather has gone, I get a whiff of it again. The notes come and go in a changing harmony.
Beautiful, stunning and a heap of other adjectives in that vein.

Longevity and sillage so far are a little subtle but will give it more time, I could eat my words. Off to look for a bottle now."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","I tried this at a shop yesterday, but I didn't like it; it's like they had blended 60% BLV Pour Homme and 40% Jaïpur Homme. It's too sweet for my taste, but it fades after 1-2 hours of spraying (it seems to be a common trend among Bvlgari fragrances, with the exception of Bvlgari Men in Black, which you can feel after 6-7 hours).

I don't think I'd ever buy Bvlgari Black as it doesn't offer much, and it's not that cheap, either--it's around $33, which is too high a price for what this perfume provides."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Unfortunately i dislike this one. It doesn’t develop well on my skin. All I smell is rubber. Not something elegant perfumey rubber, but realistic rubber and only that, nothing else. I thought it will be similar to Midnight in Paris, it kind of is, but only for that rubber note. Midnight in Paris has also vanilla and sweetness to it, Bvlgari Black has only rubber. The scent itself is fascinating, somehow they managed to create a smell of a car tires, rubber tubes, gasoline, plastic canisters with gasoline, rubber tubes with gasoline and car tires. It is fascinating yes, but I would never want to smell like that myself. I was hoping to get a smell of leather car seats with a hint of flowers and musk, all I got was the smell of car-service workshop. Anyway, happy to test it, otherwise I would be thinking about it for ages. Try if you like realistic rubber scents with no vanilla, flowers or musk. The bottle is gorgeous in reality though, lucky those who like the scent as well."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Opens up with a very original, rubbery leather that blends with a warm, nice vanilla note. The name fits perfectly, it conveys the idea of a sexy black leather jacket with rugged boots worn by someone that shows great confidence and drives a fast sport-car.
Due to the tea-note, can be worn all year round, it's quite versatile in my opinion as it's a refined, nice leather.

Bvlgari Black is a unique and refined leather scent with an untamed, sexy vibe.

Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","The 100 Days Challenge - Day 24:

A vanilla Lapsang Souchong Tea that develops into a futuristic S&M homage. Rubbery and aromatic, with a heavy cloud that is hesitant between synthetic and natural smelling. Not appropriate for ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" readers, but certainly appealing for Marquis de Sade wannabes. A fashionable statement for Halloween. ¿Trick or treat?

Today's word: Mysterious."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']",Great sweet leather scent. Different enough to be noticed but not so far out there wearing it is a challenge. Good buy.
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']",Thank God the bottle looks much better. It`s time to smell.
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","I wish the reviews I had read of this had hinted that this is in *no way* a daring scent. It is light, sweet, rather feminine (powdery-flowery powder room) and somewhat modern. The leather & rubber dimensions are scarcely noticeable under the conventional, safe perfume structure. Mom at a restaurant."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","When I first smelled this, was taken aback by the initial black tire rubber blast. waited it out because I wanted to see where the scent went and found that the dry down is lovely clean leather and sweetish vanilla, with just a hint of rubber and a tinge of smoke. This totally grew on me and now I absolutely love it. That black rubber phase is short lived on my skin and the drydown is just so good.

At first, I would only use it for layering, but now I usually like to rock Bvlgari Black on its own. Mostly wear it to get that understated edgy-modern feel and also when I go out drinking with friends. Also like to pair it with super feminine outfits, for a different kind of subtly sexy-cozy vibe. This scent evokes everything it set out to because it makes me want to go on a joy ride in gas guzzler with supple leather seats, with good friends and good music while sharing a flask of smokey scotch.

Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","i usually don't like leather, but in this perfume it is not a dead animal around your neck, if you know what i mean... soft, elegant, sexy, strange, something dark and lightly sweet, really a beautiful fragrance. i now wear it and i feel like something fantastic it will happen to me, like an interesting trip, when i am going to see other places, and meet other people, new persons, nice feeling don't you think??"
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Best of the bests unisex fragrances ,alike Cobachard and Shalimar style...Dark Green Leather without any sweetness in it
Scary ,I know ...MASTERPEACE,no doubt"
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","For first 3 hours or so I got good quality black tea, sweetened a bit maybe, with rubber and beautiful leather. There were some oakmoss accords too, as well as musk and amber. It felt stron and clean in a strange way. Didn't felt much extravagant after all. It cooled down finally to nice vanilla note."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","I bought this blind based on reviews saying it had a ""rubber smell"" because I'm into the art of perfumery I knew I had to get a bottle, and knowing the main note in this is leather (one of my favorites) I went right ahead and paid $15.00 for a 40ml.

It smells so amazing I seriously don't get anything that smells like rubber. I smell leather and vanilla mainly along with tea and amber. Vanilla usually really turns me off because I hate anything too sweet and vanilla based fragrances are kinda feminine in my opinion, but this is so balanced to where the vanilla never annoys me. This is not feminine at all to my nose it smells masculine if anything. I could see a woman wearing it tho (hot!!!) I was expecting it to be very off the wall but it smells a lot more agreeable than I had envisioned which is not a bad thing. It's still a ground breaking fragrance nonetheless, not one that followed the crowd by any means.

It's such a shame that it projects quite well but not very far. very much a personal scent... maybe spray the back of your neck to get a trail going. The longevity is decent tho, above 6 hours. I will update this when I do more testing.

Smell 10/10

Projection/Sillage 6/10

Longevity 8/10

Uniqueness/Timlessness 10/10



This is a must have for any man or woman who can appreciate the art of fragrance, or likes leather. Yes it is basically a little bit more than a skin scent It's more than worth the money and you don't need every fragrance to be on that beast mode level.
I will forever own a bottle of this it smells amazing!"
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","I enjoy 'Black' on other people, but unfortunately my skin amps up the rubber until it drowns out everything else. Occasionally I get very faint whispers of vanilla and amber, but then they are drowned out by the overpowering and nauseating smell of rubber again.

While I do appreciate the artistry and the concept, I can't wear it to save my life.

If you're planning on buying it and have never tried it, test it first.

5/5 stars for the concept and idea. Unfortunately, with my skin chemistry, it is 1/5 stars, as it's unwearable."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Did not like it when I tried it in a store, but when I wore the same shirt the next day, I couldn't stop sniffing my sleeve! It's addictive and beautiful, very soft, a bit sweet and sexy. I'm in love now, got myself a bottle =)"
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","I bought this based on its reputation and have worn it only a couple of times. I didn't hate it, but it was not love at first sniff either. I am going to hang onto my bottle and test drive it again in the future as some of my greatest perfume loves I had to grown into somewhat slowly."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","It's interesting how Bvlgari Black can play somehow the concepts of the 90s and still be a perfume more dark that many aquatic and fresh creations of that time, being thus among the most challenging and artistic. I have already reviewed it in the past but this is a composition worth going back to study. If you stop to think, structurally speaking there is not much of a difference from Black tp CK One, you realize that its monolithic aroma is an effect of a construction made of musks that oscillate between the softer and slightly animalic. However, the way it works vanilla and an abstract mineral and slightly smoky accord of Lapsang Souchong tea gives such musks a rubberized and sweet aroma that is urban and modern until today. It is a perfume that illustrates very well the contemporary trend in which we live where creation must quickly show its facets - on the skin or on blotter - and keep them throughout the evolution. Black was done by a perfumer I admire - the wonderful Annick Menardo, the creator of Hypnotic Poison."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Bvlgari Black was the first of the abstract realist fragrances, which gained prominence the following decade. Its followers explored accords such as ink (Encre Noir) and pencil shavings (Carbone), with results as workmanlike as they were nostalgic. Black, however, was not merely abstruse and conceptual - it was sensual, too. Much of that has to do with the choice of source material; Black explored the darkly sweet nuances of rubber, a note that is as mundane as it is fetishistic.

In Black, the rubber is sweet, leathery and vanillic; it is also warm and sensual, but somewhat aloof. There isn't much evolution to the scent, and its performance is not strong. However, that is also true of the scent it most inspired (Midnight in Paris), and Annick Menardo's next masculine hit (the anisic gourmand scent Lolita Lempicka Au Masculin, released two years later).

While grappling with Black, one must also stop and consider Menardo's pedigree here; in the same year, she composed Dior Hypnotic Poison and Boucheron Jaipur Homme. That's a pretty good track record.

Black is by no means a perfect scent, but it is a vital taste of what was to come. It's a must for fans of abstract realism, or even gourmands. A definite must sniff."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Damn I'm conflicted on this.

First blast is hot rubber and sour wood. Gut wrenching really. But give it ten minutes and the leather and vanilla really shine through as the rubber fades away. But give it another ten minites after that and it's just plain gone.

I can barely smell it on myself point blank, nose to skin. What a shocking disapointment after that powerhouse opening. What the hell happened?

The opening is a 1/10, the very very fast drydown is a 7/10 and then the very very fast final settling is a 1/10 for being the exact antithesis of the opening.

I want the initial drydown to last and to project, it would be a smash. As it is? I can't ever see a reason to use this bottle I bought."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","This is a tougher, S&M version of CK be. When I wear this, I don't detect any citrus or floral notes. I get a little tea, sandalwood, and amber, but mostly...VANILLA and LEATHER. This blend of notes is very nice. While it manages to be smooth and refined, it is still provocative, but you wouldn't feel out of place wearing this anywhere.

Smelling this evokes images of Bettie Page, Sweet Gwendoline, and Tom of Finland. Have your safe word ready when you put this on. Love this stuff."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Sensual. Perfect for a date. Initial blast may be a lil offputting for some, but after that a smooth leather-vanilla

Oggi non ho aspettato neanche di tornare a casa e in macchina ho scartato e spruzzato.... Una bombazza di vaniglia sintetica, dov'è la gomma bruciata? Dove è il nero? Io che amo i pneumatici e se potessi dormirei con della gomma al posto del cuscino, io che anche con 40 gradi quello che riesco a sopportare è oud 27 o ombre fauve, un oud noir o al massimo un encre noir.... Diciamo sensuale se non sentito da troppo vicino, altrimenti rischia di sembrare che mi sia strofinata un arbre magic.... Solo se amate la vaniglia. Questa è la mia personale opinione e sulla mia pelle."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","This is a very enigmatic scent.. Tea, smoky rubber, vanilla. I smell all of this and what is most mystifying of all... It works! These notes blended very well together there are no rough edges or awkwardness here. My only complaint would be the bottle is really awkward to spray, and I think there is something wrong with my sprayer as liquid leaks out around it when I go to spray :( this was an amazing bargain find $25 for 70 ML at Ross. I was on the fence for awhile with this one cause I was afraid the notes wouldn't work together but I'm so glad I took the plunge this is a unique and wonderful gem."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","I have mixed feelings about Bvlgari Black. I love the bottle, packaging and overall concept. Scent is weak to me. The first spray reminded me of a Tire Repair Shop waiting room with the dominant scent of tires mixed with a tree shaped fake rose scented car deodorizer, and an old wooden table holding well read newspapers and magazines. The dry down is sweeter. So, I'm glad I stuck with it resisting my urge to immediately wash of the waiting room scent."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","My long time love. Purchased it in Sephora with my live-in at the time who loved it. I have a soft-spot for unisex, masculine type sexy scents. This was my third experience into that genre after Kiehl's Homme scented shower gel and Donna Karan's Chaos. It was early 2000's and I fell in love with Black. It's still in the front row of my collection. Although, I do think I enjoy it more in the Fall and Winter months. It's gorgeous. Art."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","I really like this one. It reminds me of a hypothetical Diesel Plus Plus Feminine L'Eau, a really sheered out version of that one. That same guilty pleasure rubbery/sex toy/plastic note but without the creamy coconut and considerably fresher and watered down. Different on paper, more of the rubber comes out."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Brilliant concept.
Disappointing execution.

Sadly lacks longevity, or sillage.

However try it out, hopefully it works for you!

Breaks my heart as the combination of rubber and vanilla makes me weak at the knees.

If only I didn't have to bury my nose in my wrist to smell it after 3 hours."
Black Bvlgari (unisex) ~ 1998,"['leather', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'animalic', 'woody', 'amber', 'green', 'smoky', 'musky']","Love this one, it's favorite from the Bvlgari house so far. I know it says unisex, but I have a hard time imagining a woman pulling this off, it smells pretty masculine to me. I have no clue how burnt rubber, vanilla, and leather and work together to make this amazing smell, but it certainly does!"

02 L'Air du Desert Marocain Tauer Perfumes (unisex) ~ 2005,"['aromatic', 'woody', 'amber', 'fresh spicy', 'soft spicy', 'earthy', 'herbal']","There is no desert in my daily lives, I can just do my best to capture an image about what this Morocco desert air tries to tell me through the fume...

...Cloves? There arn't cloves mentioned in the notes, and the closest thing in my life I can associate to is smelling a bouquet of fragrant carnation in the day of May. Wow... now I found mon mom's dearest red carnation in velvet blue. This is the trace when Jupiter roared past the Atlas Mountains with a big breath of life, ecstasy in his cloves wine, and I found this not gourmand, thanks God it was 2005, timeless and impressive, masterpiece isn't left alone."
02 L'Air du Desert Marocain Tauer Perfumes (unisex) ~ 2005,"['aromatic', 'woody', 'amber', 'fresh spicy', 'soft spicy', 'earthy', 'herbal']","It's almost surreal. Like a painting that you step into. There are perfumes that you spray on, and then there are perfumes that you actually ""wear"". This one is the latter. It envelops you in a masterpiece of scent. Gorgeous.

I can see where this fragrance wouldn't work for everyone. It is painted in bold strokes. There is nothing shy or retiring about it. I am really looking forward to trying more of Andy Tauer's creations."
02 L'Air du Desert Marocain Tauer Perfumes (unisex) ~ 2005,"['aromatic', 'woody', 'amber', 'fresh spicy', 'soft spicy', 'earthy', 'herbal']","When I first started this somehow addiction about perfumes, LDDM was one of the first samples I acquired. Back then, I thought it was too much for me, and I went on to different olfactory journeys. Fast forward a decade and I finally bought it. It is an amazing, full on scent, enveloping you and your space. I never traveled to Morocco or India, and I have no idea how a spice bazar or the desert smell like, but LDDM is unique to my senses. For me, this is no short of an eternal creation by Andy Tauer. Magnificent is also Au Couer du Desert (extrait), very similar to the original, with added nuances. There are some fragrances that people go crazy about it (Aventus, BR540, Bleu de Channel, Dior Sauvage, etc). For that reason, the market gets inundated of copy cats that seems will never end. You can smell so much of it out there that it gets annoying. I am glad LDDM is a cult on itself. Its uniqueness and boldness are reserved for a few that can and always will appreciate it, and of course, no copy cats."
02 L'Air du Desert Marocain Tauer Perfumes (unisex) ~ 2005,"['aromatic', 'woody', 'amber', 'fresh spicy', 'soft spicy', 'earthy', 'herbal']","Once you start reading up on fragrances you're bound to hear about this one: it pretty much hit the perfume world like a thunderbolt when it debuted in 2005. And you'll see why once you try it (as you should): I've never smelled a fragrance that becomes so bone-dry as this one does. Most perfumes smell juicy during most of the time they're discernible: this smells as dry as can be soon after you apply it, but you still get the wonderful array of spices in it, from petitgrain to coriander to cumin. It's like being in a small Saharan town and smelling a spice bazaar in the sun-baked air: and thus its perfect name.

I can love this and hugely appreciate its artistry, but I feel I just don't have the right kind of personality to pull off dramatic spicy fragrances (except for big vanillas). But if you can... well, for what you're getting, this is actually quite reasonably priced among niche perfumes.

I feel bold and grounded when I wear this scent. It definitely smells more masculine than feminine. The dry down is what I look forward to in anticipation.

I don't ""see"" a man or a woman when I smell this I see sand and dusty, hot, desert shop--a place really. Sure, moroccan souk but I've never been there. I've smelled this dry dustiness a thousand times before: anywhere in AZ, deserts of NV or on vacation in Mexico. It smells like a trip I am desperate to take after >1 year of lockdown. The cedar is most prominent to my nose but I really have to focus to start picking notes out; woody but has a soft, clean sweetness. As if one is freshly showered and primped to spend the day out shopping, eating, exploring in the hot desert sun. It. Is. Just. So. Beautiful.

Edit: 1 spray on the back of my hand lasted into the evening after multiple hand washes (8+ hrs). That said, my bf found it a little masculine with the woods. I might agree so this would be a ""for me"" scent. It doesn't project all that much so my 3mL decant might be just enough in that regard. Still, art...this is art."

The first 5 seconds of the opening is incredibly fresh, im getting a lot of the petit grain.

as a moroccan, this is giving me hamam vibes(traditional bath/spa), it also has something of the ""rhassoul"" women use (it's a typeof dry clay used to nurture the hair & skin) which is probably what foreigners get walking around the souks along with the spices..

i find it very warm & extremely comforting... i mostly wear it while going to bed

it opens with a blast of amber & some spices, couple minutes in the vetiver starts to appear it gives it a clean-ish feeling which i love, the veriver calms down in a couple of minutes, it stays in background until it becomes a skin scent... on my skin it dries down to a sweet vanillic amber.

02 L'Air du Desert Marocain Tauer Perfumes (unisex) ~ 2005,"['aromatic', 'woody', 'amber', 'fresh spicy', 'soft spicy', 'earthy', 'herbal']","This is something special. I just did a review about Au Coeur du Desert by Tauer that is the extrait version of this to help decide which would be a better purchase even though our tastes are subjective. But let me tell you as I am testing these two I'm seeing more and more how they develop on my skin so differently and I love the difference. With LDDM i'm seeing that this version is entirely sweeter and way more aromatic because while there are spices and leather in this the spices do not overtake the amber and so this comes off way more vanillic sweet almost on the verge of spicy gingerbread or spice cakes.. ughh it's so delicious. ACDD does this as well but the spices overlap the amber more and the resins take it deeper with the sweetness so while ACDD is a more concentrated deeper version it takes longer to get to the sweeter base a bit but when it shifts then it stays there and lasts longer while LDDM goes to that ambery vanillic type accord from the beginning and it is airy and fluffy and it stays there the whole way. The differences with these fragrances are in the experiences of the textures and the layers that hit you either first or last. And they're so close in some ways some may question does it warrant another purchase. Look at both of my reviews and see what I'm talking about.

Though they are not that far off from each other, they do wear a little differently. ACDD because it is denser lasts longer on the skin..LDDM you may loose an hour or two in comparison to the extrait but they are such dense fragrances they last for awhile. I can see why many say they can't live without both because they are both so close but the differences are there and you wouldn't want to miss out. They are so close many would say just go for the extrait it lasts longer. But there is something nice about how LDDM hits your nose with the amber and it being sweeter. I just ordered LDDM because I want to explore the first one and see how it really works when I spray it from the bottle and I'm getting more samples of ACDD because these fragrances need to be opened up and sprayed and experienced. But from first sniff everyone will agree ACDD is denser. As ACDD takes time to develop that vanilla amber fluffiness is starting to come out more so yeah ACDD will smell allot like LDDM as it develops, but it just takes more time to get there but LDDM is already that way from the beginning to end. I like the way LDDM takes you there first and I feel like once I have had enough of that I would want to go deeper with ACDD. I honestly would not mind owning both of these fragrances. They are just too good..some of the best and as for amber this is competing with Chanel & Guerlain it just has such quality and that says allot about Tauer fragrances...LDDM & ACDD are masterpieces that make you happy from beginning to end."

But what about the smell of, like, a tree, is so masculine that women ""can't"" wear it? Anyway, I'm a woman and I wear this. The opening is loud and pungent, a cloud of smoky spices, but after about an hour it's a dreamy dark sparkling amber, spices floating on undulating cartoon scent lines, then it's vanillic at some point, and almost musky near the very end. Throughout it has this dark sparkle, like stars in the sky, or glitter in tar."

There's something sickly sweet here, which struck an off note on me with the woody spices. This combined with its strength-- I eventually scrubbed it off. Smells more balanced on my husband though, so I suspect it's a skin chemistry issue. I live in the desert and so wanted to like this.

Update: a friend convinced me to give this another shot, and a few weeks later when the weather was colder I did. And wow, what a difference a few weeks and a shift in weather makes! Everything suddenly clicked for me, and I now I'm overwhelmed with how beautiful and strange this fragrance is. I suspect the odd note to my nose was the lavender, which I couldn't make work at first. But now I see it working with the subtle smoky sweetness here, even as it's made spicier and drier in the presence of coriander and cumin. If you had a strong negative reaction initially, don't give up on this like I almost did! It has rewarded my patience beautifully."

I only found the name fairly inappropriate. This frag - in my opinion - has nothing to share with moroccoan desert but much indeed with a catholic church.
In fact, the very thought that crossed my mind when first smelling this was: Gothic Cathedral.
Plus a Baroque Catholic Church with ongoing mass celebration.
This is very similar to Messe de Minuit.
Be sure you hold yourself tight when you inhale the wave of cognac (=spices, woody aromas) and the ink-like sensation, like medicinal, oud / patchouli like. Then you'll be submerged by the incense. Even if it is not listed in the notes.
Throat burning, and very very strong.
A huge balsamic /green note, lile juniper adds. Smells quite masculine, all in all (i would not market it unisex, but masculine).
The drydown is the best part, is smells vetiver and cedar wood. Creamy and nice.
There is something high and mystic in this frag. But it's nothing I long to be associated with.
So please, have a sniff, but ponder thoroughly before buying."

The hype is real here; Mr. Tauer has somehow figured out how to capture the desert in a bottle 🏜

What an olfactory treat 👏
It smells dusty and mysterious. Its hard to explain this fragrance.
I have this fragrance on one hand and amouage jubilation (another fine creation) on my other hand.

I am drawn more to desert moracain to keep smelling the spray spot.

At the third sniff my colleagues at work started to ask „what are you doing?“. This scent is mesmerizing from the first second you put it on. It transports you into the underground corridors of Sacre Coeur. Incense, sweet spices, never annoying. You feel like you are in an old armenien monastery in which cistercian monks burn holy scents. Rosarys and other holy items come into my mind. The heartnote is what Andy describes by Moroccan desert. The dry down is a beautiful amber. Not too prominent, but noticeable. Longevity: 7+ hours.

LDDM was a blind buy for me. to be honest, I was expecting something weird, shocking, and a really hard to wear fragrance, but it was a mindblowing amber fragrance which you should know how to use and treat it. there is no ground left to question andy tauer art of perfumery. it's a beautiful composition with two main movements! the first one, the uproar of the spices with a touch of really soft petitgrain. the second movement is the emotional dance of the amber, on a dry and solid wooden stage.

tauer's 50ml bottles are not intended to be oversprayed or for daily uses or even to be used as a signature scent. it for the moments and events which means alot, and needs to be recalled after some time. 50ml bottles are more than enough for years.

the downside of this fragrance is only that it reminds me a little bit of lonestar memories. the amber in both are somehow identical, but lonestar memories is more resinous than LDDM. (LDDM is more wearable than 03).

I'm so happy that I finally have this piece of art in my collection. however I do not recommend blind buying tauer fragrances, especially if you are new to the fragrance world. it's not just a smell. it belongs to the group of perfumes that you must dedicate time to appreciate them fully.

Unfortunately, LADDM is far too dry for me. Fragrances much less dry than this one have a tendency of turning arid on me. LADDM is so dry it seems to shift off of my skin like fine sand, leaving only a faint, dusty spiciness behind. It’s a skin-scent within the hour.

I can see why some would love this. In fact, I feel like the love many people have for LADDM is closely mirrored by my own love for YSL Opium—a fellow warm, spicy oriental. Unfortunately, LADDM is not another such love for me.

The dry down is exquisite. Throughout the entire work day (office) and into the evening I am reminded of the scent's presence with a mild cedar note and the right amount of greenness from the oakmoss and vetiver. The mild powdery amber note is also omnipresent.

I spray LDDM, close my eyes and imagine myself in the middle of a desert, such a unique experience.

I do pick up some of the listed notes; mostly coriander and amber but i think with this one, it’s all about the blend rather than the notes individually and this is an exquisite blend. The only downside is performance, it doesn’t have good projection and doesn’t last for so long.

I have to deduct 1 point for the lack of performance but other than that it’s a masterpiece that i think every fragrance enthusiast should smell at some point of their fragrance journey.

Once I spent some time with several wearings and experienced the development, my opinion changed. A very unique note profile that is different from anything else in my wardrobe. LADDM performs well in the cooler months, especially with the amber woody base. A lot of strong notes that fluctuate back and forth (mid to base) without being a heavy fragrance. Check it out and give it a few wearings. A unique and enjoyable olfactory experience."
02 L'Air du Desert Marocain Tauer Perfumes (unisex) ~ 2005,"['aromatic', 'woody', 'amber', 'fresh spicy', 'soft spicy', 'earthy', 'herbal']","I would not say ""disappointment,"" but LADDM does belong to a circle of fragrances whose reputation has never matched my own experience. My anti-Pantheon, I suppose.

To me, there is a really pleasant amber that reminds me of the drydown sillage/background tone of, say, Amber Absolute or Ryder, plus an extremely linear and potent metallic ""spice"" note (coriander + cumin + tinfoil). It's like wearing two extremely different perfumes, as these accords seem to exist in parallel realities without harmonizing. And it's hard to wear because that spice note is sometimes evocatively dry and crackly, but more often reminds me of that childhood sensation of biting aluminum foil with a metal-filled back molar. Do you know this feeling?

To be fair, my feelings may be influenced by the fact that I accidentally cloned (quite successfully) the expensive and hyped LADDM by mixing an Amber Absolute knockoff oil with a huge dose of offbrand ISO-Super and a bit of overproof rum (of all things). In a blind test, the result fools my friends and families and they usually prefer my accidental potion which lacks the surgical glint of LADDM's spice accord.

Mine cost about $20 per 125ml to make.

Others in my anti-Pantheon include Timbuktu, Chergui, Tobacco Vanille, Musc Ravageur, Grand Soir, and Creed (especially Aventus, but not BdP which is beautiful),"

This is a masterpiece with low projection, but great longevity. Oriental and fresh. Best kind of citrus, best kind of species, best kind of amber gris, at a very reasonable price (119 Euros).

I think everyone should own this, but better try before buying.

I have a small decant and I really love it and I feel I should buy a full bottle because this is a masterpiece, a staple in someone’s collection ... but every time I want to pull the trigger, I just don’t, I realise I wouldn’t wear it, I don’t crave for it.. and then I end up buying something else 🥺"

I have a bottle of this which I purchased maybe 2-3 years ago. Most bottles I buy and don't wear I eventually sell... I don't sell this one because it is indeed a perfume masterpiece..

BUT...

I don't wear it... its more than 50% full and its only a 50ml bottle I think...

Why don't I wear it?

Simply put. it smells so amazingly unique, spicy, leathery, woody to the point where I actually can't find a use for it.

Sometimes a perfume can be so unique, that it feels like it doesent suit any purpose. I am not going to rule out why it isn't a Winter VS Summer.. Casual VS formal.. because I can't. I can't put my finger on why I personally feel I just cant wear this? - I LOVE The scent.. it's astonishingly unique, powerful and beautiful but never, regardless of weather or occasion does the bottle look at me in the collection like it would be a good choice. I never ""feel"" like wearing it even though I know how good it smells.

Perhaps it's just a simple as I love the smell, but the smell isn't my personality or style...

Anyway. its a masterpiece. its Tauer's masterpiece and kudos to him for creating something nice and bold and his signature style.

If this were a painting, id love looking at it, but wouldn't hang it in my house.. just doesen't go with my decor! (Man, what a good analogy)

I can pick out a lot of spice and perhaps a tinge of incense, although my nose isn't attuned enough to identify each note. The longevity was amazing on me.

Does it smell like the desert in the Maghreb region? I don´t know, I´ve never been to Morocco. It does however certainly evoke the images that Andy Tauer paints so masterfully with this perfume.

It is a beautiful fragrance to wear on a fall or winter day, or to just spray in your house to enjoy at home. This is by the way something that often comes to mind when sniffing Tauer´s fragrances ... they are not the most versatile to wear, but they would make beautiful ""room fragrance"".

DRY - MATURE - EXOTIC

Whilst not smelling too similar to Beau De Jour, I do see where @meroo is coming from. The dry down of the Tom Ford does suggest a dry coriander spice and almost sticky element like the amber in LDDM.

I wouldn’t go as far as to say LDDM and Beau De Jour are 90-95% comparable (not even 50%), however there is some continuity during the later life of the Tom Ford and the early stages of LDDM.

In any case, L’Air du Desert Marocain is justifiably a very popular choice of people in the know. There’s nothing I can add to the conversation, however I’d just repeat what many others say in regards to how beautiful and masterful LDDM is."

The opening did smell like generic cologne to me, but this quickly passed and I find honey is the most noticeable note for me and the spice and incense is right behind it.

Nothing is overpowering though, all the notes blend together in harmony. I keep smelling my wrist and catching different notes each time. it’s warm but smooth, exotic, creamy, smoky and sweet.

Smells like desert air at night.

If you like artistic fragrances I’d give this a go. It’s quite an oriental gem and a must-try, but I don’t think I enjoy it enough to purchase a bottle."

It’s an interesting airy light sweet spices and herbal blend, but the moldy patchouli ruins it for me. There are many perfumes out there that use this synthetic? type of moldy smelling patchouli I have noticed and it absolutely is a note that ruins a perfectly good scent for me. Anyone know which is the non-moldy traditional patchouli(old school-wore this oil in the late 80’s/early 90 in high school)? Many perfume samples have been ruined for me when I’ve come upon this type of “moldy” patchouli in the blend.

The very late drydown is my favorite bit from the scent, amber is dominant, the spices are subdued, and the warmth is dry to its core. Unfortunately, the vetiver accord distracts from this tale of Ozymandias earlier on.
Mature by nature, LDDM is a perfect substitute to the more aggressive and obtrusive Terre d'Hermés.
Quality is not an issue. Projection and longevity are great.

In summer it’s about sweaty spices, dry cedar and vetiver, and here it reminds me more of the desert. Niche, beautifully constructed and utterly wearable. With L’Air du Desert Marocain, Andy Tauer set the benchmark for how to do niche before most people even knew what niche was."

This is a really enjoyable scent, although I wouldn't say it's unique for the aforementioned similarities. However, I can see its appeal and it would make a great staple to anyone's collection. Very nice!"
02 L'Air du Desert Marocain Tauer Perfumes (unisex) ~ 2005,"['aromatic', 'woody', 'amber', 'fresh spicy', 'soft spicy', 'earthy', 'herbal']","When I first became interested in fragrance I got a sample pack from Lucky Scent with a few fragrances that I kept reading about on blogs. I excitedly dabbed on a spot of L'Air du Desert Marocain and immediately noticed the strong smell of creosote. Yuck! That one is a no-go I thought, as I threw the sample in the trash.

About 40 minutes later I was rummaging through the bin digging that sample back out! LDDM had morphed into a magical, multi-layered beauty. Once the smoky creosote phase had passed it smelled like spicy, resinous, caramelized wood.

This scent is heavy, but there is a dryness to it that prevents it from feeling too cloying. It has an earthy sweetness that I don't consider to be gourmand. I think this is a unisex scent that is good year round. Some might find it too heavy for summer but I wear it in the heat because it reminds me of being in the Moroccan desert. In the cold weather I wear it because it is like being wrapped in a warm blanket. Applying with a light touch will still project and last all day.

Several strangers have stopped me to ask ""What is that? it smells fantastic!"". Once at a trendy boutique the sales clerk pulled out her phone and ordered it on the spot after I told her what I was wearing. It seems that people who like LDDM really like it."
02 L'Air du Desert Marocain Tauer Perfumes (unisex) ~ 2005,"['aromatic', 'woody', 'amber', 'fresh spicy', 'soft spicy', 'earthy', 'herbal']","I've just one word to sum up this fragrance: Divine!

Earlier today I was trying out sample of fragrances which were sent to my son some time ago from luckyscents and they're meant to be 13 'Masculine' scents in little bottles about 1.5 mls. Well, there were a couple of scents which I really liked, and so I decided to write a review for them beginning with this fragrance because it's most definitely my absolute favourite.

Immediately upon opening, the scents bring to mind a traveller moving slowly through the Middle East, likely the Arabian Peninsula, and having stopped at a bazaar which is filled with not only people selling and buying items but there are numerous hessian sacks full to the brim and spilling over with spices and various herbs, namely of coriander, cumin, and cloves. These three spices are smoothly blended together to make the top note of this beautiful and unique fragrance designed for both women and men. And whilst I had reservations about how this would fair on my skin as a woman, this fragrance actually smelled divine and the mix of Jasmine, one of the middle notes, along with the Vetiver, one of the base notes, give this fragrance it's ability to work on female bodies and not be overpowering nor too spicy or darkly resinous.
As soon as you have sprayed this fragrance onto your skin a few times - it has a moderate sillage, projecting and still noticeable 24 hours after the initial sprays - you instantly receive a delicious burst of citrusy freshness, reminiscent of the sparkling lemon soft drink called ""Solo"" and of the ""4711"" Eau De Cologne. This is due, I believe, to the top notes of Coriander which provides a fresh and citrusy aroma and it is this top note which you definitely scent as soon as the fragrance is sprayed on your skin. Cumin is another top note which literally gives spice to the fresh green herbaceous aroma at this fragrance's opening. There is also the scent of Cloves which, whilst is not listed in the ingredients, is strong enough for me to believe that Clove is one of the spices in this perfume.

Petitgrain, another of the top notes, adds to the flush of citrus, providing the scent of slightly bitter oranges to the fresh burst of citrus at opening. The citrusy-spicy aroma is then followed up with even waves of fragrance consisting of a smooth and syrupy Amber and Cedar, giving the Cedar, Spices and Fresh bursts of Citrus a new accent of resinous wood.

Then, about 40 minutes in, the Labdanum, takes effect. Labdanum is not an easy scent to describe but I'll give it a go and say that it is a resinous, pine-like scent with amber, earth, smoke, and leathery aspects. The labdanum adds a rich resinous and leathery note to the entire fragrance, generating a scent which is a mix of incense, smoke, woody resin, balsamic, and smoky tobacco. This creates an entire new dimension to the fragrance, giving it subtle depths and light and shade which blends in perfectly both for lovers of Amber and with the Amber-like note itself.

There's then a fresh note of Vetiver which gives the Amber-Spicy-Fresh Citrusy fragrance and its incense-smoke-tobacco-resinous-balsamic depths a heavier, earthy aroma which is similar to Patchouli with a touch of Lemon. Indeed, here the actual base note of Patchouli becomes noticeable and blends in well with the Vetiver, creating a pungent earthy scent and Labdanum wafts up in sweet, leathery dry Musk scents and gives the wearer a touch of Ambergris, continuing the Woody notes from the initial opening.

The drydown continues the heavenly blend of Amber and Ambergris with the Labdanum giving a mix of Leather and Musk accents along with Spices. Patchouli remains as a mild scent underlying the perfume. And then imagine you are bathing in a hot bath full of suds from Cashmere Soap, Jasmine petals, and Vanilla. These uplifting scents are joined by Lavender, Birch, and a hint of herbaceous green freshness again but instead of the initial Citrusy top notes it's from a mix of Birch and Oakmoss. The base note of Geranium provides a lemony green scent which is also a little peppery, mixing with the remain of the Spices that run throughout this fragrance from its opening to the drydown.

This fragrance, L'Air du Desert Marocain, is not only a divine Spicy Oriental perfume but it evokes images of travelling throughout the Middle East's Arabia Peninsula and its bazaars full of resinous spices and herbaceous Citrus spilling out of hessian sacks whilst the air is redolent wit the warming aromas of Incense being burnt on braziers, Ambergris and Amber mixing on charcoal briquettes to provide beautiful resinous balsamic and spicy aromas which now and again are accented by the scents of sweet florals like Jasmine and lemony green Citruses worn as essential oils on the skin of the many women moving through the bazaar.

This perfume evokes not only the image of a Morrocan desert on a hot evening but travelling along the Silk Road with the famous explorer, Marco Polo. Once you delight in the initial opening of Fresh, Greens, Citruses, Amber and Ambergris notes, you are vividly recalled to the spice markets and bazaars which Marco Polo, trained as a merchant as well as embarking on numerous diplomatic missions, not only wrote about but stopped at and explored. This fragrance brings to mind Marco Polo exploring these bazaars and spice markets, the resins and herbs, the beautiful jewellery and the plush multi-coloured rugs that decorated the walls and floors of the bedouin such as those in Morocco which this perfume's name indicates.

This fragrance has been written about as ""one of the most popular in the line"" of Perfumerer Andy Tauer's fragrant creations.] and this is stated with good reason. Composed of Spicy Oriental notes and inspired by Saharan deserts in the moonlight and evenings in Morocco, the perfume is suited to both women and men and its mix of Woody, Aromatic Amber and Balsamic, Soft and Fresh Spicy accords with its perfect blending of the various notes so they blend seamlessly into this absolutely divine fragrance more than justify its expense.

It is ideal to wear for any occasion but it seems particularly suited to warm evenings and winter nights by a crackling bonfire, and to being worn to special occasions because it is, after all, a unique fragrance and so suits unique and special occasions, such as celebrations (from birthdays to anniversaries and Weddings) and to make an impression at a job interview, to occasionally wear to the office, and on a night out whilst dressed both warmly yet elegantly, in a little black dress if one is a woman or a business suit if one is a man.

This fragrance is beautiful, sophisticated, classy, elegant and unique and suits women and men who are intelligent, mature, creative and imaginative and know where they're heading in their lives and careers. It's not for the indecisive, the immature, nor for those who are afraid of challenge or change. This perfume is for the creative, confident and classy."
02 L'Air du Desert Marocain Tauer Perfumes (unisex) ~ 2005,"['aromatic', 'woody', 'amber', 'fresh spicy', 'soft spicy', 'earthy', 'herbal']","Picked up a good sized selection of partially used, mostly niche samples for a ridiculously good price.

This was one of them - a tiny 0.5ml remaining - and I'll be honest, it's just amazing. Nothing too 'out there', but just a wonderful, Western-appropriate oriental that is a perfect, subtle-yet-present blend of the notes.

Think I'm going to have to scour samples - and perhaps full bottles - for the rest of the line. This is signature scent worthy stuff and I want to know what this smells like worn 'properly', whether it's masculine enough (for me), its performance etc. I can understand the cult status around this, and imagine it was really special 10-12 years ago. Less so now perhaps, but still very good.

EDIT: 13/7/20 - Coming back to this having finished a second sample and I'll say as good as this is, and as groundbreaking as it was in terms of offering a new commercial option for online buyers (effectively leading to what is the modern niche market) much of its aura doesn't seem to be related to the scent. Focusing solely on the fragrance, it's good, clearly it's good, and interesting, and a nice, dry, dusty spiced amber. I enjoyed sampling it but I didn't find it to be a top tier amber or oriental on my skin: if anything, I preferred it in the air, and perhaps would prefer it as an aroma to scent a room. Ultimately, the Au Coeur flanker is LADDM, but better, and improves one of the major failings of this fragrance - performance. I still think this is a good scent, though, and deserving of 8/10. Just not quite top tier.

02 L'Air du Desert Marocain Tauer Perfumes (unisex) ~ 2005,"['aromatic', 'woody', 'amber', 'fresh spicy', 'soft spicy', 'earthy', 'herbal']","I have been wearing this fragrance for the second time for around 5 hours and it's still going strong. I has to be the strongest EdT I have ever experienced.

The opening as well the first hour and a half are exactly what the name of this fragrance implies. It is dusty, dry, spicy and ambery. Dare I say it remotely reminded me of Roja Parfum's Enigma in the beginning. They are different but initially it had a slightly bubbly cola vibe on me. That did eventually go away after 10-30minutes and there were no similarities afterwards.

This particular fragrance has a mysterious and adventurous vibe to it, where you really can picture standing in a veranda overlooking a desert and a spice market nearby. You hear people bartering far away and the warm wind blows in your face as the sun sets. You get whiffs of the spice market as well as the arid, dry air of the desert. This is in the first hour and a half or so.

In the dry down, it is a bit disappointing in my opinion. The amber is very dominant in the base of this fragrance and it does feel quite old fashioned. It reminds me of a 80s amber fragrance with not much else going on. It's not distasteful or off-putting in anyway. It just loses the uniqueness that was present in the opening. It's just not as interesting. Dare I say it just feels a bit old lady-ish. It may be just on my skin.

Both projection and longevity are solid. Most amber fragrances are I find.

There are reviews around saying that it's not versatile and it's hard to find occasions to wear it. I don't understand where they're coming from with this. This fragrance is quite versatile as long as you don't wear it in summer. 3 season wearability is versatile to me. Furthermore, it can be worn both in special occasions as well as just casually. Lastly, I'd say it's perfectly unisex. Thus, it IS a versatile fragrance.

I would definitely recommend as this fragrance is rare in that it does transport you to another place and another time. I would definitely try before buying though. It's not exactly mass-appealing."

It's a very dusty, 80s rose....urm okay?

Either I'm smelling something totally different to everyone else, or this is just a sad case of Emperor's New Clothes....

Kinda smells like my late grandma's old closet in her garage."

I get lots of amber, some spice, some very slight animalic’s in the opening (but not harsh or skanky as I tend to hate these kind of animalic notes myself), and some woods. On my skin it dries down to a very creamy amber, and I definitely detect some ambergris. I get the same fizzy / dusty feeling when ambergris and sandalwood mix, which reminds me of the dry down in Bois Du Portugal (which happens to be my current favourite fragrance).

This is a love from me and I think I will need to pick up a bottle. The only downside is I’m not sure when I would wear it. I have asked 3 people to smell it on me and none of them like it. Its therefore not one I would wear to work, in a casual setting, or on a date with my wife. I may just have to buy it for myself to enjoy when I’m relaxing with a drink and thinking of Arabia!

Smell - 9/10
Longevity - 8/10 about 6-7 hours (out of a tiny 1ml sample atomiser)
Versatility - 3/10 (but it smells so good that I don’t care!)"

Andy Tauer 02 smells like a 80's Amber fragrance. As I´ve been to Morocco I can´t imagine anything that smells of Tauer 02 besides ppl with 80's perfume. The sweet vanilly amber is pillowed by classical woody notes like vetiver and cedar. It´s not a bad perfume, but nothing groundbreaking. It's powdery. If I want all these aspects, I use a much cheaper Bijan pour homme."

If you sniff around the metallic atomizer you will feel it!

""L'air du californian cities"" - That's a smell that I just smelled in Los Angeles.

Taking that apart, It smells amazing on skin but even better in the air.
Not a beast mode at all means. Last around 6 hours.
Funny thing is that the projection is good for about 3 hours but when it become a skin scent it kinda disappear quite fast.
It is a super distinct smell. Quite rare to find something similar in the market.

It would be a staple on my wardrobe if it last a bit longer on my skin (at least 8 hours)

Amazing scent which lasts and projects all day. Faultless on both aspects.

I've never had this one tagged as unisex though, it's very masculine for my point of view. Some lighter notes but overall it's a man's scent.

Spices, patchouli, amber and wood notes with some soft floral notes behind them just blend so magically together.

An absolute masterpiece.

Any downsides? Only one. The price. I'm not saying it's overpriced, but it will stop lots of people being able to afford it. And that's a shame, cos it's just a brilliant fragrance. And everyone deserves to try this at least.

Masterpiece."

I am on the other hand a huge fan of just about all the other listed notes in this, especially coriander and cumin (I wore my sample of it knowing I'd be at lunch in an Indian restaurant that day) which is why it's frustrating that I didn't pick up on the coriander and cumin but only the cloves.

Maybe I'm just a bit sensitive to that note.

I respect this fragrance a lot for what it has managed to do, but I won't be buying it."

I sprayed just once, then had a shower, smells the same, washed hands multiple times throughout the day. Not any weaker. Went to bed and smell it. The lasting power is unreal.

The opening is absolutely beautiful and I would wear it myself, but then it changes into masculine leaning fragrance.
It reminds me of I Coloniali fragrances, which I love. I tried to add some vanilla to make it more feminine and it turned into something like Casmir Chopard.
I think this would be very sexy on a man, but for the right occasion and applied in moderation.

When I say in moderation, I mean do it like French women. Spray it once in the air and walk through it. More and it's dangerous territory."

This is absolutely gorgeous and truly transportive. The amber is the star here, it’s intense, syrupy and dense. There is an array of a spice cloud in the background that immerses the sweet amber, but it never overpowers. Finally, there is a raw floral sweetness in the background.

In the dry down, there is a cooling freshness from the essential oils of the herbs.

Very unisex and wearable, perfect for a summer evening.

This captures everything you would want to experience in a Saharan desert- escapism, cultural wealth and an unapologetic authenticity. One thing I love about this fragrance is how all the notes are blended to perfection, so that none of them clash and emerge individually. They all combine into a beautiful blend. I love how the fragrance embodies the intense heat as it is very warm in character and holds a lot of depth.

This is what we are looking for, creative expression and transportive masterpieces.

Excellent performance."

There is a big difference between the opening and the dry down, the first 1-2 hours are very dense, dark and stormy.
I am not sure if this was big mistake or a big creation that eventually forced the title of the fragrance but surely it is a pleasant olfactory experience. I realize that in the last 2-3 years I haven’t used this fragrances and I believe that one of the reasons might be the nose behind it, let’s not forget that Mr. Tauer has a degree in chemistry and before becoming a “nose” he was a chemist. I wander if any of his creations will ever have one natural ingredient besides water but for this reason his prices remained affordable.

If you need a simple, crowd-pleasing fragrance, better stay away! For L'air du Desert Marocain is a niche fragrance with a capital N, aimed at experienced perfumistas and true connoisseurs; it's not meant to be liked by everybody and their mama.
The opening is quite animalic (read: stinky) - you'll be shocked by the smell of dirty socks and manure! Upon closer inspection (yes I'm brave), it's the combination of strong cumin in copious amounts, indolic jasmine, coriander and my enemy petitgrain that produces such an off-putting effect. But, please, don't run off just yet! Wait for another 10-15 minutes until the scent settles on your skin, and you'll be rewarded with something beautiful and mysterious. On the one hand, there's vetiver, cedar and a hint of patchouli, and on the other, sweet amber/labdanum. After another half an hour, L'air du Desert Marocain starts to resemble MFK Grand Soir, only less sweet, which leads me to conclude that labdanum eventually emerges as the strongest note. Moreover I swear there must be some ambergris in the 'Marocain' as well, because I can catch wafts of MFK's another bestseller, Baccarat Rouge, with its unmistakable combination of sweet resins and salty ambergris.
I would say that L'air du Desert Marocain is unisex, leaning masculine; however, as a mature alpha woman, I've found it to be perfectly wearable. Silage is moderate, but longevity is superb - 10+ hours."

I also smell another ingredient like anise or licorice adding another layer of sweetness

It deftly pairs the traditional amber accord (labdanum + vanilla and so on) with linalool-rich coriander and creamy atlas cedar. It's not wildly creative, nor is it especially daring, unique or noteworthy; even the name is slightly derivative. But the fragrance smells wonderful, has a mid-level sillage and tenacity, and delivers on the notes promised, for the most part.

For the price, it's a good deal if you like cistus/amber fragrances. Some people find too much labdanum/cistus turns their stomach and prefer more sweet or vanilla-rich ambers--this one isn't for you. This is a well-realised, cistus-heavy amber that is at times intoxicating and slightly addictive.

If you like the cistus and want to explore similar scents, I'd recommend Chantecaille's Kalimantan, a classic oriental amber inspired by Borneo. You can find my review on Kalimantan's Fragrantica page."

It's hard not to like it for pure nostalgia's sake and perhaps in the right setting , on the right person, heads will turn, for a moment.
Personally , I can't help thinking that smells of this kind evolved to relieve the senses of the ungodly smells emanating from the royal courts of europe. But just like the masterpieces adorning their walls, you need a chateau and the 17th century to make a home for it."

It has a severely hostile opening followed by a dry and dusty drydown, which ,as the hours pass, tends to become more approachable, softer and smoother. This is not a friendly scent, most likely it is not going to gather you compliments and is somewhat unwearable. However it is a beautiful creation, so different, so artistic. This fragrance has depth and deserves to be explored.

James is a great guy, as are all the staff, and he knows, or should that be Nose, his stuff. If you've never been to the store I highly recommend it.

Anyhoo, having previously had a 5ml sample of LDDM I was instantly drawn to try it first. Popped the cap, sniffed the sprayer, hit the trigger and soaked the test strip.....AMAZEBALLS, blown away by it. Has a frag ever been so aptly named? Was tempted to stop my sampling there and just buy it. However, common sense won the day and I went through the whole line up and I'd say every one of Andy's creations is a hit in my book, except Tuberose, but that's for another review.

Back to LDDM, having been mesmerised by it 30 mins earlier I decided to test it and Lonestar Memories on skin. 2 sprays of each, one on each hand, off to a cafe, munch some food, slurp a coffee, did a few emails etc etc and then back to Les S to make my purchase.

James asked what one I was going for and I said......Lonestar Memories, and it wasn't even a tough decision. I never thought I'd say this but you've got to tell it how it is, and on my skin LDDM is flat, dull, lifeless and totally devoid of character. I asked James' opinion and he concurred that everything that makes LDDM so compelling just simply wasn't there on me. The rich concert of spices and resins coupled with the depth it has were morphed in to a what at best I'd say was a 'Coriander-esque slightly woody skin scent'. BUT don't let that put you off as I'd still recommend this as a fantastic frag and defo worth at least sampling.
As for me I'm now very much in the camp of Andy T admireres and I guess I'm a bit of a Tauer fanboy!!"

Now, the bottle that this review is for is LDDM 2017.

UPDATE: I ordered a 2019 bottle. Not much difference. I can't even tell. It's definitely still a winner. Nice pettigrain, coriander, resins. Very dry. It definitely reminds me of a desert. 9 hrs longevity so far, moderate but respectable sillage. Way to go Andy!!! Tell IFRA t o go screw themselves!!!

P.S. I got a nice bar of scented soap from Andy and a nice thank you card with my 2019 bottle. Who bothers to do that anymore??? Nobody I know of except Andy Tauer and Olympic Orchids, Ms. Covey. Anyway, it was a nice touch!!!"

02 L'Air du Desert Marocain Tauer Perfumes (unisex) ~ 2005,"['aromatic', 'woody', 'amber', 'fresh spicy', 'soft spicy', 'earthy', 'herbal']","There is no lavender, birch, geranium, patchouli, moss or amber listed on Tauer's website. And as a previous reviewer noticed, it's pretty funny to see how the brain can be influenced, and how some may smell ""rose"" by not knowing that ""rock rose"" is a synonym of labdanum (that is: a resin extracted from the cistus flower, that smells green-ish, but not even remotely of rose). Also funny to read that some feel the ""warmth of the amber"", while there is no vanilla in this one, nor in the pyramid, nor do I smell any (amber= resin+vanilla, while ambergris= animalic/salty tincture, made form sperm whale feces).

What I get:
This opens with a strong petitgrain note, supported by spices.
Then a strong green labdanum note shows up, supported by subtle florals.
The ending is spectacular with a dusty cedar note supported by vetiver that nearly reminds me of tobacco and booze. Can't spot the ambergris.
The effect of sand/dust made by the spice is impressively real.

As for performance, I confirm the statements of a couple of previous reviewers: it starts subtle, but after an hour or so, the projection becomes average/good. The longevity is stellar, as I can still distinctively smell it as a skin scent after 24+ hours. I will not reinvent the wheel in saying that it's a spectacular spicy resinous frag, one of the few that I thought deserves its price. It's a work of art and the hype is real.
I cannot do otherwise than loving it given how cleary noticeable each single note is and how creative and unique this one is. Just keep in mind that this is a ""cuddle at home during a cold day"" type of fragrance, to enjoy while drinking a tea (best if Moroccan).

Best on Fall/Winter days, unisex, 30+"

A stereotypically Middle Eastern scent but light & inoffensive, almost airy, as if it was a light spicy scent smelled in a cool breeze, & as opposed to the usual heavy Arabic creations.

While it is a very likable fragrance, I believe LADDM is hyped up because it is one of the first to introduce Arabic scents to European & North American countries.

As an Arab, this is a very familiar & a not very distinctive smell & I feel as I've smelled this scent (or something like it) a lot before but that doesn't take away from the fact that LADDM is in fact a beautiful smell.

Also, this fragrance, as good as it is, is overhyped.

Overall, a lovely smell & a great introducer to Arabic smells. Safe for blind buying."

I don't often challenge nonsensical reviews, but I had to pick yours apart - not least because it directly contradicts your other positive reviews (and belies your own taste).

I am surprised you thought that LADDM would - or should - smell like North African desert air. Would you expect Bleu de Chanel to smell blue? What about Eau Sauvage? Do you think that smells of ""wild water""?

Your favourite fragrance is Roja Dove's Kingdom of Bahrain and you've written a glowing review of that; does that smell of Bahrain? What about another of your favourites, Clive Christian's Chasing the Dragon Hypnotic? How does that smell? Of fire, cinders and smoke? What does ""hypnotic"" smell like? Or dragons? You know they're mythical, of course - so how do they smell? (I'll save anyone else checking the Clive Christian notes: they're clove, cinnamon, and cherry.)

Although you personally aren't enamoured of LADDM, it doesn't mean that people's glowing reviews are inspired by hype and aren't their genuine opinion. Just saying."

It was as though I couldn't quite tell if it was similar to something I'd smelled before, and if not, what was different about it. Andy Tauer must have worked some kind of (al)chemical magic when he formulated L'Air du Desert Marocain, because it is truly a shape-shifter. With killer performance, this fragrance morphs depending on your body chemistry and ambient environment. For me, it smells much more floral and green in hot, humid weather; the cold, on the other hand, tends to bring out the spices, woods, and musks. Almost none of the notes are distinguishable from one another, usually the mark of an expertly blended fragrance. The result is more of an olfactory experience than a fragrant artifact to be studied and dissected. Dry, yes, and spicy too. But also soft and floral. The hint of a vintage vibe, but altogether postmodern in its composition. Not everybody is going to like this, and I can definitely see how it could be off-putting to some. L'AdDM is not a timid fragrance, and doesn't apologize for its eccentricities, but instead wears them proudly on its sleeve and invites you to share in their delights. Genderless, and could work for anybody over 20. The bottle certainly stands out in my collection, and Andy's personal touch and amazing customer service are pretty unique in the fragrance world.

Indeed, the desert has no scent. On the great outdoors the only scents that air carries are those from the trees, flowers, moss. All those things you won't find in a desert.
The desert is called desert because it's deserted.
Sand and sandstone unless you dive your head in it, won't give you much scent.
It is the atmosphere. The imagination of humans.

Though I believe if I would wake up with my face looking up at the sky, in Zion, Arches, Bryce NP etc, I would know in a matter of seconds I would be somewhere in Utah or Arizona.
Not because of a scent but because of the air and the climate.
Just a thought. Just my imagination.

On the fragrance: I also have a lot of negative experiences with overly hyped fragrances. So I try to take it all with a pinch of salt. I want a sample of this before jumping on the bandwagon."

I've just got into bed, having showered, and really just wanted to go to sleep - but I couldn't, because I felt naked without perfume (anyone else get this?).

I lay in bed for 5 minutes or so, being pestered by one of my cats who is (understandably) feeling particularly unsettled and - let's be frank, here - pissed off by the canine interloper, wondering what on earth would settle my jangled nerves (three ageing cats and an energetic German Shepherd pup do not make for a calm household, despite the pup being born into a home with 5 cats who are completely inured to the 5 dogs already there). My cats view the pup as... I dunno... an alien? They may well have been chased by neighbours' dogs, and Monty's introduction has not gone down well.

The only perfume I could think of was L'Air du Desert Marocain. To put this into perspective, I own nearly 850 bottles of perfume and at least as many decants/samples. I have no idea why LADDM soothes me, but it does. It's austere, dry, complex and... well, simply, quite wonderful. It screams quality and Andy Tauer's love, care, and attention to detail just pours out of the bottle, onto skin and into my soul. I'd apologise for the hyperbole, but I'm too tired to excuse or justify it.

It's simultaneously unlike anything I've smelled (although I detect the bones of Le Maroc Pour Elle in here), but familiar; it's classic, modern, and completely unisex.

Let me explain why. I was not in the desert, and I do not know how the desert air smells, and therefore I will not speak on this subject. I want to say about 2 notes that are not in the pyramid, but personally I feel. one . it is a delicate lime scent, when grandma whitened the walls, that's exactly what smelled, I adore this smell - the smell of lime and calcium, it is this note that I always smell in the aroma. 2 note-delicate aroma of incense + with dry wood, in combination with lime, this is just a magnificent alliance. It was he who brought me back to my childhood to beloved people who are no longer there: (and at the same time opened a new veil of perfumery revelation of the Master.

As for some comments about sweets. It all depends on what kind of skin you have. I have an ice and this flavor, for me just a delight. My husband is hot, and that's what a sweet amber appears on her. It is on the hot male skin, the fragrance has lost its charm and the scent on it has revealed more feminine and sweet! if not for the nuances of body temperature. In my opinion it is a SMELL.

In those times, I was very skeptical about the names of the fragrances and the ""legends"" accompanying them. Never before, any fragrance created images puted in the name, and did not transfer to any place, whose name it was called. But L air Du Desert Marocain managed to do it.

I sprayed it and immediately transported from cool evening in the Moscow to a desert, with hot sand under the scorching sun and dry air, burning the lungs, with every breath. The hot wind carried many aromas teasing nose. There, caravan make a camp and from the heated, for a day’s journey, leather, saddle bags comes smell of dried flowers, herbs, spices and dried fruits; and from where the nomads set up tents, the wind brings aroma of handmade, wooden figurines and smoke from burning incense.

Ordered a sample I've been wearing for a week and can't see what the hype is over this scent! It's a good perfume that opens up with cumin and citrus, not much neroli to my nose, screeching top notes that aren't of my taste. Cistus and jasmine hit next, and that's when I detect an incensy note I can't put my finger on... It stays quite linear, getting thinner and not developing into the rich, sticky, smokey aura its name suggests. It just don't deliver. I'll wear it with pleasure, but there are orientals such as Shalimar, Opium or even Obsession that performs better and are far more complex for maybe s fraction of its price."

I became so immensely happy when I found this! My immediate reaction was that I´v found my holy grail and that it smelled ""me"" like no other perfume I´v encountered.

On me, the final dry down becomes a bit to vanillary and sweet, but its still one of my absolute favorites.

There is just the right kind of smokey incense with coriander and sand. Its warm and I find it comfortable. Like my favorite worn in, but still really good looking, clothing.

And I truly love the opening of dry, warm sand!

On me it blooms in summer heat.

L´Air du Desert Marocain and Au Coeur Désert are really similar to me. They have different openings (I prefer L´Airs aggressively sandy dryness).
There´s not a big difference in the dry down on my skin, but Coeur doesn´t have the same vanillary final stage and lasts longer, so if I had to choose, I would go for Coeur. But I love both of them!"

It is midday and the sun is beating down. Warm gusts of wind pass through the medina levitating dust from the ground and mixing it with the smoky, comforting aroma of pipe tobacco drawn and exhaled by wandering old men. A few yards away from the spice stall is a cookie vendor; the essence of vanilla drifts over the various spices displayed upon sun-baked wood. A luxury 3rd world."

Starts off dry and dusty with quite a lot of spices, changing over time to leave this real sweetness. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's gourmand but it's like having a Moroccan meal, starting with savoury and spicy dishes before finishing with a sweet pastry dessert."
02 L'Air du Desert Marocain Tauer Perfumes (unisex) ~ 2005,"['aromatic', 'woody', 'amber', 'fresh spicy', 'soft spicy', 'earthy', 'herbal']","I wish I smelled what everyone else is describing! On me, this is ambergris and more ambergris. Which I like, but it's certainly not a night in Marrakesh! Happy I bought my sample, but for me there's no need to go out and spend tons of money on a full bottle. I'll probably use up my 2 ml in the hopes that someone else will be as captivated as I'm not.

Update: Surprise surprise! I put this on at 9:00 this morning. It's 4:30, and it's settled down into a spicy, woody fragrance that is a lot more complex than the linear ambergris that I've been getting all day. Still no florals at all, to my nose or maybe it's just my skin, but I like it better than I did earlier. Still not going to buy it, though.

Another update: Today I used up the last of my sample. Lo and behold, I love it! I got a blast of ambergris in the initial spray, but it evolved quickly into smoky, spicy, amber-y, woody perfection. Now, more than 9 hours after I applied it, I've been waiting for the sweet, creamy, vanilla-like notes to appear, and it never had even a touch of anything floral as far as my nose is concerned, but that's okay. I'm still sniffing my wrist and enjoying the desert wind evoked there. It's funny how the opening of salty, oceanic, animalic ambergris morphs into North African incense floating through sandy tents in a bazaar. Cool trick, Andy Tauer! But dammit, now I have to go buy a bottle!"

It actually leans more to challenging side rather than to wearable side. That is maybe a reason why it has never been cloned. And thanks to that, it stays super unique to this day.
I was in the past in Morocco. I walked the streets of Marrakesh and Fez. I climbed Jebel Toubkal and ventured through the desert of Sahara on the back of camel. I remember climbing dune in the middle of the night while the sand was still warm. Sky was full of stars. I wish I could wear This masterpiece in that very moment.
That is actually what this fragrance is about. It is about a moment, atmosphere and feeling.

Well done Andy.

With no formal fragrance training, L’Air du Desert Marocain is only his second creation, but it’s now critically acclaimed, gaining a 5-star rating as “a masterpiece”. With his glowing legacy in mind, I’ve been late getting my hands/nose onto this superstar-de-parfum.

The opening wasn’t what I expected. Such sweet labdanum (reminiscent of Le Lebo’s ‘Labdanum 18’) combined with sweet incense with amber and woody, bitter twigs from orange petitgrain with spices. It’s so sweet, I had to double check there was no vanilla in it. There isn’t, but there might as well be. It’s way too sweet for me in the opening. The dry-down becomes a woody, bitter, but highly aromatic scent that remains very strong, never relents but fades to an underlying sweetness which still projects after many hours. On me, the dry-down becomes similar to Tom Fords ‘Noir De Noir’.

My expectation of a fragrance inspired by a nomadic Arab of the desert, is perfectly embodied by Amouage’s ‘Ubar’, which would be my preference over L’Air du Desert Marocain."

Yep - it delivered! Held off for so long as the price for an EDT was off putting. It turned out I procrastinated too long.

It is well deserved in its reputation as unique. It just IS one of those perfumes.

It reminds me of a few things like:

- the colour purple
- dusk in the desert with a cool night coming on with your bare feet gripping the cooling sand and a cool wind blowing the scent of desert flowers and shrubs toward you
- a leather jacket covered in sugar
- vinyl records with sugar coated almonds nearby

Very emotive, strong but subtle so not going to knock people in a room over but strong enough that people will start sniffing the air nearby.

The amber, cumin, woods, labadnum, lavender keep it warm and the very subtle citrus and vetiver balancing it out making it cool at the same time. A weird scent with juxtapositions...

Unlike descriptions of a desert in the sun this very much reminds me of the opposite, like the time of the day where it is cold yet there is still warmth radiated by the rocks and earth... just like the marketing spiel...

Unique and definitely one of the perfumes that everyone must have or try like Serge Lutens Fille en Aiguilles or a Nasomatto for a take on the left field...

Just bought the beefed up EDP version Au Coer Du Desert... can’t wait..."
02 L'Air du Desert Marocain Tauer Perfumes (unisex) ~ 2005,"['aromatic', 'woody', 'amber', 'fresh spicy', 'soft spicy', 'earthy', 'herbal']","I would first compare L'Air du Desert Marocain to the edge of a sword: its so unified (without being simplistic), whole, it comes together perfectly, geometrically. There are two sides of it that dovetail perfectly: the 1) cinnamon bun sweetness and the 2) dry woody smokiness. The latter is transparent enough, and the former subdued enough, that the fragrance as a whole is like the nucleus of an atom with proton and neutron bonding tightly together. I believe this is a great example of what Mandy Aftel calls the ""burying"" or ""locking"" of two fragrance notes. The sweet side of it is red, and dry side is green, they are almost opposites, but when they come together, you get nothing but a white point of light. The message conveyed by this fragrance is psychedelic on one hand, and on the other hand, classical and above all, Platonic. I like Tauer perfumes because they all have this fearlessly Platonic theme."

It’s peacefulness in a bottle. Especially now in cold weather when I think the incense comes out stronger. Which is funny because it does not have any listed but all together Andy Tauer managed to bring an incense-like accord from other notes. Like that calming feeling when you enter a cathedral, a forest in autumn (or an empty stadium - ok, this might not be such an elegant reference but for those who run track in their past lives may understand the feeling)."

I admit I can’t handle a strong coriander note in fragrances as all I smell is something that reminds me of a vinyl shower curtain freshly taken out of the wrapper. This why Kouros, Bottega Veneta Essence Aromatique and Gucci Rush all turn my stomach, they all have that creamy plasticy note.

02 L'Air du Desert Marocain Tauer Perfumes (unisex) ~ 2005,"['aromatic', 'woody', 'amber', 'fresh spicy', 'soft spicy', 'earthy', 'herbal']","This is a seductive but sort of dry (as in desert winds) fragrance. I quite like it but im not sure I LOVE it. Thats subjective, and in fact its growing on me. There is a lot of cedar and a hint of vanilla. It becomes drier and what some are calling harsher. But the harsh is very masculine and Ive noticed smells different depending on who is wearing it. SO try this one first. It works on me I think, and the harsh note, which has amber and vetiver, and im guessing the rock rose.... and then later one notices the jasmine and lavender. Not much lavender actually. But cutting across all of it is this very nice cedar note. It does, as someone said, smell like a rug shop in Rabat. Its that souk smell that is so captivating. Its definitely a man's fragrance I think. Its not carnal or animal sexy, and its not a dignified Saville Row scent. Its exotic but not heavy. And perhaps more for a man in his 30s and 40s. Or older depending.Not a classic I dont think, but its very very captivating all the same. Longevity is good.....projection is decent, but its not meant to be a loud scent. Good stuff and I find myself returning to it more than I might have thought."

Have you ever visited an ancient mosque? Andy Tauer brought me back. It is not a simple shop smell but a work full of spicy and woody smells (merit of coriander and cumin). It is a scent that gives an infinite desire to isolate yourself from the world, to prostrate yourself among the sand dunes, to find your own inner oasis. Yes, it's really commendable.

Where does this scent fit? Who knows or cares, that's a problem of a lesser kind. This fragrance is a painting. It's meant to be admired not to ask where it should be hung.

However, I got my full bottle today, so I think the time is right. Straight from the get-go I get loads of cedar, cedar and more very realistic cedar. This lovely woody note is accompanied by a variety of spices (especially cumin, which subsides in a few minutes) and some sweetness pushing through, could be vanilla. Strangely it feels very nostalgic, and personal. It reminds me of my grandfather painting something in the balcony using an old wooden cabinet as a table or a stand. Basically it makes me think of a heated up wood cupboard with paint drying on a cloth canvas. As LDDM dries down, however, it gets sweeter, but never annoyingly so, kind of reminds me of gingerbread cookies. The longevity and projection are amazing, one spray is all you need, two if it's in the dead of winter when it is freezing outside.
In the end, what can I say? This is beyond special to me and it will always be one of my favourites (if not THE favourite) fragrances of all time. It really does transport you elsewhere, but to me it is not the Maroccan Desert, but my childhood home way in the past..."

Dry, green, very resinous and coniferous. A pleasure to wear. Hints of herbs and citrus flowers and quality of conifers which brightens any mood. Woods in the dry-down.

As time passes by, those bitter resins and spices get weaker (they will stay till the end tough) and at the same time scent gets sweeter and a little more powdery.
In this part scent has a little dirty and kind of animalic feeling as well but it's very mellow.
Projection is good and above average and longevity is around 4-5 hours."

In fact, it smells a bit like the shaving soap that my grandfather (a former barber) uses, so it is comforting but not necessarily something I would wear in my own skin. I bought a tester on Luckyscent, I love that we can properly test these niche scents that are very rarely middle of the road. I'd rather discover something is not what I thought than bore my nose to death with scents that were clearly designed by a committee of consumer researchers to please as many people as possible without truly delighting and of them.

This is a layered fragrance with many facets and nuances. It is a super-projector and even just one or two sprays lasts at least 9 hours on my skin. If you are a foodie like me, the first recognizable items would be cumin and coriander. A bombastic, assaulting bitter accord of oak moss, vetiver, birch and cedar follows, This is then somewhat tempered with a honeyed-resin ""amber"" accord (tons of cistus labdanum and perhaps benzoin/vanilla) and jasmine. This stuff keeps going and going. It is quite remarkable in the longevity department. An iconic oriental spicy/woody delight by Andy Tauer."

02 L'Air du Desert Marocain Tauer Perfumes (unisex) ~ 2005,"['aromatic', 'woody', 'amber', 'fresh spicy', 'soft spicy', 'earthy', 'herbal']","OK, got my 1 ml sample from Lucky Scent. When I first just dipped the dabber in the vile, and spread a tinny bit on my finger, it reminded me of a favorite fragrance, 80% the same: MFK Lumier Noire Pour Homme.
It beutifully blends patchouli, cummin, and rose, in a perfectly blended accord.

Then later I dabbed it on heavier, and it became quite a different fragrance. I got that harsh, dry desert air vib.

I was guessing I was going to smell amber, or labdanum, (rock rose resin) but not as I ever knew them. It's an amber accord, with some sharp synthetics and cumin, and vanilla.

This has a lot of virtual notes, like Le Labo fragrances. There are lots of aldehydes and synthetic notes, but done very well. Andy Tauer has a degree in chemistry and uses aroma chemicals masterfully here.
I think the dry, harsh desert air, comes from the synthetics. Then there is that soft and natural oriental accord, as in the Lumier Noire I mentioned; Patch, cummin, and Jasmine. It is a beautiful accord here, perfectly blended, to where you don't pick out the individual notes.
Like a musical chord, it has it's own identity, not easy to pick out the notes, unless your very musical.

I'm not sure I love this. I have harsh medecinal fragrances that are more wearable than Desert Moroccan, like MFK Cashmere Oud. What I like most about desert Moroccan, that patchouli floral accord, is done so much nicer in MFK Lumier Noire homme. It is more floral (rose) but the rose is well blended, and doesn't get feminine.

I can tell you this is a light oriental.
There is more Patchouli and Jasmine, and less amber than the note pyramid.
I'm sorry, but it does smell like a harsh household clenser at times, with some lavender added to soften the harshness. This is mostly just in the opening few minutes, it then begins to settle to something much nicer.

Gals if you kind of like this, but would like something a bit more feminine; I would suggest Lumiere Noire Pour Homme, or pour feme, or Narsiso Rodriguez for her.

I agree with many reviews, that it's not very wearable, but more interesting in an artistic way.
I think my rating will be somewhat low, because I think a fragrance can be very artistic and wearable.

It smells a little soapy at times. I get something like a sweet medecinal candy, like Ricola; It's nice. One of the Moroccan city smells, wafting in... Someone mentioned, root beer, that's a good comparison.
OK, it does change and develope, with some transportive exotic smells, that are very pleasant. The cummin note is a big part of this exotic accord; it is very unique.

This fragrance is getting fun. It is very unusual in a fun and pleasant way. Reminding me of ELdO's fragrance ""Rien"" in that way.

Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']",Literally smells like a baby wipe.
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","The quality of this fragrance is top notch. You get what smells like an actual fig tree. Which means you get a earthy, subtle, semi sweet scent. I think this is an incredible scent; I just wish it would do better with its performance. However, it’s one of those scents that when you get a whiff of it, you smile and know you smell incredible. 9/10"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Fig trees coastal orchard somewhere in southern Greece. Fresh sea breeze, peachy figs, milky crushed fig leaf sap, fig wood. This is a story perfume telling of realistic memories. 10/10"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","This review is for the body wash. I was hoping that this would smell like the Figuier candle and room freshener, but Phlyosikos is a different scent entirely. While Figuier is light and clean, Phylosikos is way too sweet and milky for my taste. I was too lazy to take it back so I used this up anyway. I must not have hated it."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I made friends with a Macy's sales associate... she came over during the holidays and gifted us a Jimmy Choo box full of samples.

My nose was still inexperienced at the time... The name and presentation of Philosykos and Diptyque intrigued me.

Oversprayed this on me wearing Pyjama pants and nothing else, curled up next to the fire under a blanket with my girl... I was honestly blown away at how good I smelled.

This scent introduced me to photorealistic perfumery.

I wonder if I'll chase that same Philosykos high forever...."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I swear this scent depends on your body chem. This smells like a fig tree on me, the wood and sap included and doesn’t last long. But when my boyfriend uses it, it smells like a creamy fig fruit and it lasts until the morning. I think the weather is also a factor. It smells a little better on me during monsoon season."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Philoskyos from Diptyque is a scent I don't wear very often because I am not quite sure what to make of it...and I don't know how to pronounce it, either. It is meant to be a perfumed ode to the fig tree in its entirety, the wood, the leaves and the fruit, but to be transparent here, I have never eaten a fresh fig, and even worse I sometimes get confused about dried figs and dried dates, so I'm already at a loss. What I do experience from this scent is the milky sap from a broken twig and the fragrance of spring greenery, damp from a morning rain. Despite that, it still comes off as dry, and I would expect it to also be fresh and light, but somehow it's strangely musty. I wear this on days when I know I've got a lot to think about, to remind myself that it's okay to not know everything, and maybe never reach a conclusion."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","On me this is a very long lasting (at least 12-15 hours) skin scent. It isn't screaming, as others have said, it is a whisperer. Very milky and creamy to me, bedtime scent, summer loveliness with open windows and the scent of green wafting over you! I love this."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","This scent takes me back to two years ago, on a hot summer day when me and my boyfriend took shelter in a nearby mall. We happened to pass by the dyptique store, this was when I discovered they had a perfume line. Philosykos was the first bottle I picked up, spritzing lightly on my neck, I was immediately engulfed in light and summery notes. There wasn’t an obvious alcohol scent, which was quite rare for most perfumes, you could very faintly make out the fragrance accords, but they were blended in perfect harmony. While the top grassy/fresh notes were prominent, the milky and creamy base notes were the perfect vehicle to carry the scent of figs. Honestly, this fragrance truly reminds me of a fig tree. Specifically the milky sap of the tree, brought out by light rainfall on a hot and hazy summer afternoon. It smelled so youthful and nostalgic, yet sophisticated and timeless. My boyfriend bought it for me soon after as I kept rambling on and on about how much I loved the way this fragrance diffused on my skin. It’s been two years and I have somewhat grown out of it, with only a quarter of the bottle left, I’ll leave this for a summer vacation to Europe. But the elegant philosykos bottle on my vanity will be forever emblematic of the joyful passing of time."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Super pleasant! But, not what I was looking for when I bought a sample based on reviews and the notes.

It is really nice and green initially. I would most definitely say even citrusy, my brain could be processing it that way because of the green notes + fig. I would say this scent is very soft and enjoyable. I get the fig (true, green fig) darn near the entire time.

What I wanted out of this was the tree, cedar, and woods notes. I wanted to smell like a forest walk. To me, this is all soft plant, no sturdy tree and wood. I think it’s beautifully blended and I can kind of pick out how the cedar could be attributing to that, but right now I’m on a hunt for something where the wood notes have far more presence, and on me it’s not this.

To me this is just a nice, fresh/green fragrance the whole time that had managed to not be screechy. Just not my type of thing. If you like that though, you’ll love this."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Definitely a new favorite! Reminds me of those sweet old ladies who garden, drink tea, and read a lot of books. It’s one of the most realistic green fragrances I’ve tried. Smells exactly like what you read in the description. Love it! Wish the silage and longevity was a bit better, but I am grateful that this exists. Can’t complain!"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Great take on the Original fig perfume Olivia created for L’artisan. She surpassed her original creation for this one.

Fig is one of those mute fruits where the perfume oil can’t be extracted. Olivia’s genius work to imitate the fig tree from her selection of olfactory notes is impeccable. I would go with the EDT, EDP is heavy on the coconut and cedarwood drydown!

If you are curious about her work for diptyque check out oyedo, feu de bois, muguet, freesia, John galliano and mimosa."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I’m not a particularly big fan of green scents. I expected the fig to be a little juicier and sweeter and was let down. This isn’t bad, it’s just not for me. Extremely green opening, literally smells exactly the way leaves smell when you rip them. The fig is more of an afterthought, especially in the dry down in my opinion. I get little to no woody notes. This is a really grassy and outdoorsy smell. Would be good for spring. It’s very mature IMO."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']",Very interesting scent. I like reading everyones take on what it smells like. As a kid growing up in my parents house we had a garden with lots of plants. One in particular was a jasmine bush. When i would play outside i would pick the leaves from time to time. It was always interesting to me because this white milky substance would drip out the leaves once picked. It had sort of a green coconutty smell. That scent mixed with wet cement is what i smell with this perfume. I know it sounds weird but its actually nice and pretty unique.
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Tried this on my skin today for the first time, and I'm amazed at how beautiful it is. When sprayed on paper I get fresh, green fig, which smells great, but reminds me slightly of room spray - whereas on (my) skin, the coconut note blooms underneath it all, lending a soft, feminine, creamy quality to the scent, making it whole.

Perfect summer daytime scent, although I can also see it making a great scent to wear to bed, with how calming and soothing it is.

When I picture who would wear this and in what scenario, I see an attractive woman in her 40s with tanned olive skin, black curls, simplistic makeup and a summer dress.. reading a book in the shade of her lush backyard garden.

Great job Diptyque."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I want to love this but unfortunately it is my least favorite scent from Diptyque. I don’t HATE it but sadly all I smell is Comet, the green powder in a can that’s used to clean bathrooms."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I came back to this today after not having smelled for a few years. Today is almost a spring day, sunny and relatively warm compared to the snow and ice of the past few weeks and I wanted something green to wear. This fit the bill perfectly. It smells like fresh green plants sprouting up in a newly warmed sun. Bright and happy and fresh. I’m so glad I decided to wear this today."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","This is green, green, green fig! Imagine that the fig grew on a plant instead of a tree. Then imagine breaking off a lusciously plump green stalk and watching the white milk sap slowly ooze from the plant while you're surrounded by tempting not-quite-ripe figs all around you. That's this fragrance.

Sillage isn't huge on me but the longevity is good...we're at 6 hours and I can still smell it although it's a skin scent. Maybe applying to clothing will improve the sillage!

The coconut rounds out the green notes from becoming too sharp or bitter, and this is as close to a real green fig scent than you'll ever find. Not too sweet and really on point with Mother Nature. A real treat for fig fans!"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Fig is one of my favorite fruits. So I blind bought this. 100% happy with the purchase!

It is a lush fig tree with some figs sprinkle here and there. Green, juicy, woody."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","This is The One that started it all.

It was probably around 2002. I was still living in Boston, young, early career and broke. My signature scent at the time was mostly Givency Amarige and sometimes Mugler Angel in the winter. I always loved perfume but tended to have 2-3 max. One day I was in Neimans in the Copley mall and stumbled upon the Diptyque section. Loved the bottles and aesthetics! I think Philosykos cost about $88 for the largest size at this time and I thought it was SO expensive. After sniffing Philosykos, perfume was to become an obsession for me. I was used to perfumes smelling like 80s-90s mainstream designer stuff; mostly synthetic and “like perfume.” Philosykos was a whole scene, a whole experience, so new and different. I was mesmerized by Philosykos. Figs, leaves, branches, the whole freaking tree! I left Neimans with that bottle thinking it was so pricey I wouldn’t be able to eat the rest of the month. I loved wearing every spritz of that bottle. Thank you, Diptyque, and thank you Olivia Giacobetti, for making this amazing fragrance. 💜"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Just WOW.

Beautiful, clean, natural, and perfectly captures the green fig tree in summer where you can smell a subtle sap from the leaves.

THE BEST FIG PERFUME. I've compared it to l'artisan and acqua di parma, and this is hands-down the best. It mimic the green fig tree the best, and not overly sweet. Just something you'd wanna keep smelling and don't get tired of easily."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Got a sample from a Diptyque store here in LA. I'm late to the party. This is the most realistic fig fragrance (and the only one I've put my nose on so far). Philosykos is so milky and juicy, the coconut note sealed the deal for me. This is one of my top targets for 2021, and I can't wait to own a bottle. It only lasts about 5-6 hours, but those are the best 5-6 hours you'll experience throughout your day. Performance might be average at best, but the scent is to die for. Projects somewhat heavy for the first hour-hour and a half. Very unisex. Anyone can wear it. It doesn't smell dated at all. Has stood the test of time, and I'm glad it did. Best for warmer weather, more causal that formal, and more of a day scent than a night scent. Literally, anyone can wear this."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","This is so fresh, clean, green, creamy, milky and sweet! It’s amazing. This is a good signature scent because you can wear it all year round.
In the winter Layer this with Diptyque Tam Dao! It’s amazing!"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Gia1913 has it spot on. I feel the exact same way towards Philosykos: sometimes I enjoy it to the point I want to call it my favorite perfume ever, but the next day the idea of wearing it again seems crazy to me. Smelled up close, the green notes remind me of freshly crushed tree leaves, which is highly vegetal and almost bitter. This sharpness is reminiscent of some kind of plastic I can't exactly put my finger on. But smelled from a distance, Philosykos is delicious. It's one of the only ""cozy"" green fragrances I've smelled. Take your time with it and hold on to your sample."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Conflicting perfume. I love it some days, and I hate it on other days. It could smell like the most fresh, green, sappy fig leaf with beautiful drydown of milky coconut fig, or it could smell like plastic and give you a headache. It also depends on the weather, the skin or fabric. It's addicting when it is, and disgusting when it is."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I need to contextualise this review. I am generally not a fan of green fragrances. Herbaceous, grassy, and the like is usually enough for me to avoid a fragrance. Green Irish Tweed by Creed is my idea of waterboarding. I love Philosykos by Diptyque. I love the fig notes. Fig notes that are multidimensional and include the leaf, sap, fruit, and even the bark. I love the initial. I love the dry down. I love the subtle coconut and the woods (that pay homage to the fig tree) that linger. The artistry displayed in the development of Philosykos is writ large. You can not sleep on anything by Diptyque, but this one is remarkable."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Smells, lush, green...wet. Its really sexy if you understand it.

The fig makes it juicy and sweet and makes the crisp chewy greens and in the far far away distance, fresh coconut.

This reminds of Greece.

Its balanced, warm, singular, fresh but rich. Perfect for autumn or summer evenings."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","If you spray this on you you will literally smell like a tree. It's so ""green"" it's like splashing green paint all over you. After about 20 minutes a touch of woody notes come alive but nope, it's still green. At the end I can pick up a faint coconut note which sweetens it up a bit but at that point I don't care anymore. I am convinced I am a fig tree.
That said I have a lot of admiration for the uniqueness and craftsmanship it took to make this perfume.
Green is just not my color."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","It opens up as if you just crush some fig leaves between your palms, very very green and milky (in a leafy sense not in a dairy sense). When it dries down a bit, it turns out to be something still quite green, fruity and sweet. If Tam Dao makes me feel like a walking temple, Philosykos makes me feel like I am a tree and I can actually photosynthesise under the sun but in a good way. A must have for me."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I was very excited to try this one out. I was disappointed. The opening smells exactly like green nuts before they ripen. If you have had green almonds or pistachios, then you know what i'm talking about. The dry down is nice with a milky coconut accord."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","What I like in Philosykos: realistic green notes which smell literally as if you were crushing green leaves in your hands. Nice. Also, some airy freshness, like the wind moving through branches of a tree. I love this bit. Overall the scent is very smooth, clean and somehow noble.

The green notes don't last very long. It becomes more woody and also fig and coconut notes are prominent. I keep testing fragrances featuring fig or fig leaf notes and I absolutely adore them one day, and dislike on another. There is something in Philosykos though which made me put it on my 'love' shelf and it's staying there for now."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I really disliked this. The top note is very sharp, bitter and grassy. Coconut makes this cloying and headache-inducing. The combined scent smells like Playdoh. I had to wash this off. I was very disappointed."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Nature in a bottle.

It evokes memories of running through a field after rain. Climbing through leaves on tree tops. Lying in the mossy undergrowth of a forest. Freshly cut damp grass.

This fragrance provides more of an experience. It's an amazing achievement to have this in a bottle.

This is something I would wear by myself for myself, a little bottle of memories, to wear on my own for comfort. Possibly while out for a walk in the cold crisp air through a forest, I'm not sure. It isn't one I would choose for an event or night out.

All in all, very pleasant. A nice experience. Expensive for something that I wouldn't get a lot of wear out of. I will be donating to a friend who will hopefully get a bit more use out of it."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","This is what hooked me on niche fragrances and I've never looked back once, more than twenty years ago. This needs no review from me, I'm just here for a tip for fellow frag heads. I discovered that Philosykos, topped up with Black Saffron by Byredo is the most divine combination. I'm not a fan of layering. But these two together- WHOOOO boy- it's a trip."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Too green for me. This is fig leaves, even though the notes mention the fruit or other notes, I don't get these."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","This is very natural. I find it comforting. The opening is green, fresh, and realistic. Someone said it smells like the inside of split open branch. I definitely get that. Then you get a hint of coconut and fig. And the dry down is my favorite—soft, creamy woods."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Sample this for about 2 days. Basically, if you want to smell like a walking Fig Tree in a green place (I did) this is the scent for you. It is the smell of clean greeness. It's not very long lasting, so make sure you overspray this, and spray on clothes too. I did that I kept smelling it on myself all day, in a pleasing way. I like it, but I like Tam Dao more."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","A natural, unisex, happy fig scent for anyone in any season.

As many have said before me, this is a lovely realistic fig, tree and all. So expect green rather than fruity gourmand fig. I don't really get the coconut or cedar, just the fig. I find it quite linear but I don't mind as I capital-L-Love fig. I can wear this any place, time, or season. It's a good stand-by for when I can't decide on a scent--it's very calming and inoffensive."

Branches and leaves still lay on the grass beneath. Fruit is near ripe, awaiting harvest, releasing their fragrance gently. You pick off a fig and white sap gathers at the top as you breathe deeply.

Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Everything that other reviewers have stated concerning the pros of this product I would agree with, with one caveat. On my male skin, it turns to a powdery and floral aroma that is too feminine for my liking. The dry down lessens that quality but I still smell too much like a florist’s assistant for my liking. For those that like this fragrance, the longevity and quality are undeniable. A recommended purchase for those of a different skin chemistry."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","This perfume totally changed my mind about perfumery and got me hooked for ever. This is an artistic fragrance, a great representation of the smell of the fig tree. I got very good comments, everyone liked the fact it smelled so natural. If people can notice it on your skin they will love it. It's so original, very unisex dark mysterious, simply wonderful !
I have an issue with performance, but it did well on others skins."

My first Diptyque as well. I sampled this a year ago- and it had a strange effect on me-- like ""baby in a crib"" happy! I was aghast at what a LARGE bottle this ""niche"" entailed! Happy happy on that point! (I'm more used to 2.5 ml. on most). Single alpha-Men & younger men in general will probably hate this as it has the said ""baby's crib head"" vibe. So not a safe BLIND BUY for A-Men. Women - especially over 40 will cling to this like it's a built-in function. I shall not bother to explain the notes and specifics: rather the feel is , so mellow and free. Like you have the whole week off and this is day one! Or it's Spring and that last day of school is tomorrow. This is an ""anti-perfume"" that evokes feelings likes it's nobody elses business. The ""milk"" aspect makes this lean female by nature. Again , MEN may not be happy with this as a ""blind buy"". I shall be making another Diptyque blind buy soon!"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Philosykos is my first Diptyque. The quality is good but it is very expensive.

I would say Philosykos is a unisex perfume and a moderate projector. After two hours you need to move about for it to project; it's a skin scent four hours in and mostly gone after five hours.

The first blast gives off a smell reminiscent of grass and fresh earth after the rain with a touch of woody notes, a hint of coconut and a touch of fig. The fig in question is not the fruit but the leaves and the fig tree. Around an hour and a half later the grass and fresh earth has changed to a more herby smell and a slightly different set of green notes. It's still a creamy fig smell over it. I don't get any cedar though.

I would sooner have Hermes Un Jardin En Mediteranee for a fig leaf scent than Philosykos or perhaps the Monotheme Mediterranean Coast. They're both considerably better value and the Hermes is a better perfume. Nevertheless, anyone interested in fig as a note should give this a try.

Best creamy fig perfume."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Tried out the EDP, which smells like a dead ringer for 痱子粉 (Chinese baby diaper rash powder) and crushed leaves on me the whole time. I do smell the coconut note, but overall baby rash powder, which trust me, is not what you want to evoke for others. Very linear for me, did not get any woody notes. Sickly potent and strong sillage for a good 3 hours before fading bit by bit, gave me a headache and I was trying to wipe it off all day at work. Definitely goes on the no purchase list."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Well made green fig scent, which smells quite natural. Opening is green and watery, while later stages become a bit more milky and woody because of the added coconut accord. Fairly basic in its execution but for someone who is new to fig based scents a good one to start out with. In typical Giacobetti style, it's ethereal and pleasant, lasting mere hours. Perfect for spring and summer. Suitable for nearly any occasion but I'd leave it for day wear.

7/10"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Philosykos is a coconutty green and wet fragrance. I see myself wearing it more on a rainy summer. It is the most unique smelling fragrance I own as expected from a niche brand.

On paper, it smells like crushed grass. Better test this on the skin or it wouldn't do you justice. To me, it smells like a room fragrance that I would want to wear. I love this... if it were for the TERRIBLE performance. You will get more out of it if you spray on your clothes.

Will I repurchase? NO. Longevity sucks."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I have never seen or been close a fig tree, so I cannot comment on to the realism of this fragrance. Although Olivia Giacobetti created Premier Figuier (1994) two years before she created Philosykos (1996) I'll take Luca Turin at his word that Philosykos is ""the first proper fig in perfumery."" This review is for the EDT, which is the original formulation. The EDP (2012), which Giacobetti also worked on, is slightly different, with more emphasis on the milky, coconut notes.

Although I love many floral fragrances, I have found only a few florals that I really enjoy wearing in the summer. This summer I added Beyond Paradise (2003), Bronze Goddess (2008) and Waterlily Sun (2014) in my perfume collection. Each of these florals are summer personified in their own way. As much as I love my newly acquired summer florals, my absolute favourite summer fragrances are those that distinctly smell of summer, but belong to other fragrance families.

Philosykos is inspired by the smell of a fig tree, not just the fruit, but the entire tree including the leaves, the sap, and the wood. It is a distinctly woody fragrance with fresh, green, fruity notes that is so unique and refreshing for summer. To me Philosykos has a cool, dark, almost gothic quality to it. It's the fragrance I reach for on hot days when I'm wearing a black dress and dark sunglasses. Philosykos is a a modern classic, a fragrance that I'll continually repurchase. Also, how gorgeous are the illustrations on Diptyque's perfume bottles? They visually do exactly what a great fragrance is supposed to do, allow you to imagine yourself in other time or place."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I found this to be a very versatile scent but more suited for warmer weather. Here in sunny California with our Mediterranean climate it's just perfect. This was my first Diptyque fragrance but not my first foray into fig scents. Philosykos reminds me of Marc Jacobs pour homme. I definitely smell the fig and coconut which lingers prominently throughout the drydown. I can see how others characterize this scent as an ""experience"" as it is evocative of an afternoon spent under a fig tree. Philosykos is very pleasant and you can't go wrong with this choice, that's if you don't fancy figs. It was one of my preferred choices in the Diptyque line."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I agree with L.bss re: wearability. This is my first Diptyque fragrance so I'm not sure how Philosykos compares to others from the brand, but I've read a bit about the company and it seems to me they're less concerned with creating something that will make a human smell nice rather than selling an experience. That's what this is. An experience of a summer day under a fig tree; fruit, leaf, bark and warm, light air sweet with all its fragrances. This could be a room spray or a scented candle. Not to sell it short - on the contrary; it's extremely high quality. But it does indeed raise the question of wearability. If you want to smell like an experience, then this is for you. But there are people who want their perfumes to make them smell nice in a human way and that's not exactly what Philosykos does.

So, whereas witch_mum said this is unisex, I would actually call this genderless (there's a difference). I agree that Hermes' Jardin en Mediterranee is more in the 'unisex' category; I find that one to be an experience scent as well, but with a bit more of that human, 'perfume-y' quality to it than Philosykos, a bit more concerned with wearability."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","When I described Hermes' Un Jardin en Mediterranee as the mother of all fig scent, then this here is the grandmother.
A very dry fig without any sweetness and the coconut goes without the Bounty-like sweetness, too.
This is much more a unisex scent IMO as the mentioned Hermes scent.
EDT has moderate longevity and sillage on my skin."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","This is fig! nothing else! everything, you start with this incredibly green sappy fragrance (some pepper to wake it up I believe) and the slightest sweetish aroma of the fruit. Great balance btw salt and glucose. So authentic on this base of woods. very vegetal and elegant.
I am a bit puzzled by the wearability, it's great! but a bit soft and I wouldn't be sure on which occasion I could use it. Maybe it reminds me of the stickiness the fruit leaves on your hands that stops me to use it in public😂 besides jokes, it's great!"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Figs.
Will that do?
OK, bit more info needed. This is a classy scent, nothing harsh, cheap, or synthetic about it. First spray you get a lovely warm sweet creamy aroma of figs. Then the initial hit dies down a little, and you're left with a warm creamy aroma of figs. Figs themselves, fig leaves crushed, the whole fig tree. There's a very, very slight undertone of cedar, a coconutty cedar, but mainly figs.
I got about 5 hours smell from 3 short poofs, on warm skin on a warm evening. Morning after, can't smell it on me anymore. Sillage is moderate.
Is it worth the money? I would say yes, if you love figs obviously."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","This opens very green and a bit humid but quickly turns to a creamy, milky, coconut/fig. I love the drydown so much."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Disclaimer: I do not have the original perfume, I have a perfume oil which is supposed to be identical to it and this describes my impression of that scent. I will however not be able to comment on the original's longevity or sillage. If this is not allowed, I would appreciate it being pointed out to me and I will gladly remove this review. This only serves to give an impression of the scent as I experienced it.
EDIT: In the meantime, I have acquired the original EdT and am glad to report that it is indeed identical to the oil I have so feel free to disregard the disclaimer. I would categorise the sillage of the EdT as 'polite' and the longevity as 'moderate' - 'long'.

It opens green, dry and vegetal to me. It quickly softens to a creamy, soft green. It's fresh and natural, but not in a particularly 'airy' way. There's a slight zest to it, something almost minty in its nature, but it never goes the whole nine yards to become too spicy in its freshness nor too sharp in its greenness. The creamy aspect is definitely the foundation here, giving the green notes their fair share of free rein but never unleashing them entirely.

There's a subtle sweetness to the creamy aspect; for some weird reason, it makes me think of mashed banana. Not the smell but more like the consistency in a way. If consistency itself had a smell, this creamy base would be it. It's warm but not suffocating, a bit like sunscreen in terms of warmth. This works beautifully in heat and/or humidity but I could see it being cosy enough for spring and maybe early autumn as well.

It's a strange mix of a clear yet opaque scent. I'm not sure I'm expressing myself correctly or intelligibly, I apologise. What I mean is, there is something crisp and fresh here but it's as though there's this slightly milky haze enveloping those notes, like a light summer mist in a lush garden.

For some reason this evokes the imagery of dark summer shade to me which is probably the fig. Even more than that though, it makes me think of water. Dark, deep blue water, cool and fresh and quiet. Balenciaga's L'Essence and Calvin Klein's Truth, both of which I have and love, do much the same thing to me. Maybe it's just me, but I get a similar base vibe from all three, executed in different ways. L'Essence is a summer garden wet with fat raindrops; Truth is a dive into a pond in a forest; Philosykos is like a little secret garden on a summer's day, cool with tree shade, a bit like Elio's secret hideout spot in Call Me By Your Name.

All in all a very lovely summer scent and, so far, a real compliment magnet. Very unique but kept pleasant enough as not to offend or annoy. I'm not sure yet whether I consider that a point in its favour or not. I do like my quiet, introspective greens, but the ones I've had and loved so far have always had a bit of a risky edge to them while Philosykos never seems quite daring enough to make much of a statement that way if you know what I mean. On the other hand, this might be a good thing as it is unique enough in and of itself and very well done, no need for an exclamation mark. This is growing on me very quickly. The longer I wear it, the more I fall in love."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Top note is so green and natural scent. When dry down,this one smell like rubber (in a good way), but I can't found coconut scent on it."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Insanely realistic natural fig scent, the tree more so than the actual fruit. Well, there is some fruitiness to it but rather of unripe figs. Personally I cant distinguish the coconut or any other notes, nevertheless it is a very rounded scent that perfectly captures summer in the Mediterranean countryside.

It's the first fig fragrance I ever smelled and even though I was very intrigued right from the start, as a scent it was still a bit more green and natural than what I was used to back then, when I first smelled it. So while I'd still put some on a test paper strip whenever I walked by it, I'd still never pick it up.

Finally I ended up buying Attique by Lubin, which to my nose was similarly natural but a lot more fruity, instead.

But I am glad I got introduced to fig as a fragrance note by this perfume. It's a lovely fragrance. I'd recommend it to anyone to give it a try.

Sillage, however, is very soft. You'll get it wafting around you a little bit for the first hour. Longevity on me in very humid and warm climate is up to 3 hrs, which is a bit of a shame, so keep that in mind."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","WOW! So pretty. Just got a sample of this - at first I was already wearing a perfume so I just sprayed it on some cardboard. That didn't do it justice - it just smelled like green leaves/green notes. However, on the skin, the coconut and fig really come forward. The coconut is like real, fresh coconut milk/flesh - not cheapy fake coconut like in more youthful and/or B&BW scents. The green notes are still there but melded perfectly with the coconut and fig to create this beautiful, light, fresh, slightly sweet spring/summer scent. Can't wait to get a full size! Plus Diptyque is cruelty free, so A+ in my book!"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I love the smell of figs, but it's one of those scents that can easily be one-note or veer off into candle or room spray territory. The fig fragrances I've tried that feel like true perfumes to me are few - L'Artisan Premier Figuier, Annick Goutal Ninfeo Mio and Diptyque Philosykos. Obviously I haven't tried them all so forgive me if I've left out your favorite:)

Premier Figuier and Philosykos both have an earthy, green, woody opening that evolves into creamy, coconutty, sun-ripened figs with a hint of leaves and branches. I find Philosykos to have more depth and last longer on my skin so I went with it over Premier Figuier, but in my opinion they both have very similar personality.

Ninfeo Mio is more like walking into a giant garden and strolling through the fig grove. It opens with an almost bitter green and citrus top note. Ninfeo Mio stays airy and crisp but it develops with warm woods and fig to round out the sharpness.

I get moderate projection and staying power from both Philosykos and Ninfeo Mio. Wearing either of these fig scents is a mood-lifter and I enjoy them year round. Philosykos is a little sweet for the hottest summer weather, and Ninfeo Mio is a bit fresh for cool weather. To me they represent the two ends of the fig perfume spectrum - green and sharp to creamy and ripe. I love both!"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","This smells exactly like a fig leaf or a branch that you have broken in your hands and sniff. I don’t mean it “sort of” smells like that but it smells perfumey or powdery it smells EXACTLY like crushed up fig leaves with a little bit of milky green fig. I don’t get any other notes other than those 2.I don’t know if I really want to smell like a photorealistic green leaf. Personally I prefer Premier Figuier it smells incredibly similar but it’s more nutty, smooth, and more well rounded with the other notes but still ver leafy, figgy, and green."

Today I just buy it and have time to learning together again, the top note is a very fresh cut fig leaf for me, so amazing I feels like I am walking in the morning inside the fig garden, wearing t-shirt and in my hand it was a wood sculpture that I don’t know why I hold it in my arms. Yes! it was a great combination between the greenary with woody scent! always warming and relaxing. I really love this fragrance eventhough I prefer floral scent more, but this one always remind my memory when I first sniff the fragrance from Diptyque."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","The nectarine/peach comparison is spot on. Literally, spot on. It's like when you're well in to eating the fruit, in the wet, fleshy heart. It's a fruit that's undeniably nice but it's not necessarily a pleasant experience (in my opinion). It's not really a 'moreish' fruit - and in this sense, nor is this fragrance. It can be nice, but there's always something about it that is in danger of jarring and becoming annoying, even cloying.

Other than that, it's fresh, fresh greenery - fig, yes, but a smell of wet greenery if you can avoid thinking about peaches.

Honestly, I really like this. Not sure I'd want to wear it, per se, as although it's undoubtedly unisex as it's almost an aroma rather than a perfume, it feels jarring on my skin and too feminine.

A lovely, bright, fresh, natural-smelling fragrance...but not one where I want to buy a full bottle.

Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Sweet figs and creamy coconut morph into dryer woody (but still figgy) notes. There's something a bit aquatic in the drydown as well, which lends even more to the Mediterranean atmosphere. Unique and wonderful."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","This smells pleasant, and is easy to like and even to love. But does it work as a wearable fragrance? I agree with those that say it smells like a fig tree or a fig branch. Yes.. that's a nice smell. Is it something I particularly want to smell like day to day? I don't know.

Smelling this brings me imaginary thoughts of strolling through an orchard of fig trees in the spring time. It's definitely not an offensive smell. It's a light, pleasurable scent. But it doesn't really smell like a cologne/perfume. It smells like trees. Literally, like trees.

After reading about this, I was almost about to pull the trigger on a blind buy bottle. But I'm glad I didn't. This isn't a bad fragrance at all. It's very enjoyable. It's not boring either. Nothing else really smells like it. But I don't really have much interest in smelling like a grove of fig trees. There are some green notes that LITERALLY smell like that smell when you split open a tree branch. It brings me back to my childhood, having play sword fights with tree branches. It's an engrossing and beautiful scent. But do I want this as my cologne? I can't say that I do. I can think of several green fragrances I'd take over this if I want a green scent.

Does this make it a bad scent? No. Just definitely not for me. Is it for you? I don't know. But this one is definitely not a blind buy. You might love it and want it right away. You might hate it. You might love it, but still can't bring yourself to want to wear it, like me. Only you can decide.. and that's why it's not a blind buy. It's something you'll probably at the very least LIKE if not love. But like, love, or not... this one's different enough that you'll probably benefit from trying before buying."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']",This a very unique fragrance initially I was drawn to it because I love coconut notes and you can really smell the creamy coconut note but then my sister mentioned that it smells like raw eggplant and now I can’t get that out of my head it kinda does smell like that
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I purchased Philosykos EDT just before Christmas 2019 and love it so much! It is a very green and fresh scent with a hint of coconut. I can't get enough of it! Unfortunately the silllage is very poor and I have to spray a lot of it and even then it doesn't last very long on the skin or on clothes. I have since purchased the EDP and bring the EDT out with me to top up throughout the day. Between the two, I still prefer the scent of the EDT but they're honestly very very similar. Philosykos EDP is just more green and naturally stronger and longer lasting as it is a parfum. I thoroughly enjoy having both in my collection, but will only repurchase the Parfum once this runs out."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Went through a 1mL sample and bought a bottle immediately.

Wearable in all occasions. Totally safe for work or being around sensitive people.

Absolutely sings in the spring and summer, but I still enjoy wearing it in the colder months because it is very creamy.

A true work of art!"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","This is a review for the solid perfume in the little, heavy, embossed black case. I honestly don’t know if this is the EDT version or the EDP version. It was a gift from a friend who knows I’m obsessed with fig notes, and because we travel together, it’s the perfect perfume to take on a trip. No worry of spills or breakage.

That said, I’m not a fan of solids. I can’t tell if it’s the perfume or if this really has zero projection. Skin scent from start to finish. I can smell fig and some woods. Lovely but very light. I can not recommend the solid, go for the EDT or EDP instead.

I will need to do a proper EDP review in the near future."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I own several fig scents and this is really the cream of the crop so far, very realistic and super fruity. On my skin, it opens up with the characteristical fig tree, but soon warms up into a coconutty fig and stays that way for as long as it lasts. The projection on my skin is quite strong with only one spritz, but as I love it, I can't complain. If you like green, fruity scents, this is signature-worthy all the way. I will try to use it with Jardin Mediterraneé from Hermés to see if I can amp up the dry aspect of it, to make it even better.

2/27 Update: I'm trying it in combination with Un Jardin en Mediterraneé, and I have to say the astringent notes of UJeM just blend exquisitely with the creaminess of Philosykos. Glorious. If you have both, give it try; you won't regret it.

Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","A masterpiece, honestly.

There's a fig tree near the marina where I work, and I recently picked an unripe fruit and got the milky sap all over my hands. This is exactly what that smells like.

Unlike the L'Artisan Premier Figuier, this is much less sweet, and I'd say even a little bitter, and so woody.

I honestly don't get much coconut in this one, which I'm thankful for, as most coconut fragrances are endlessly nauseating to me. They always smell synthetic and so unlike real, freshly opened coconuts like the ones I grew up eating in the Philippines."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Nice review by modernwarpaint below.
She says it smells like a split open branch.
That's what I wanted to emphesis. I put this as my signature for Fall.
It is so clean and natural.
It smells like when I was young and peeled the bark from a green branch. This is a fig branch, with the green wood.

When I dont know what to wear, this is a great go to frag. It will never be offensive. Almost a natural non-fragrance kind of smell."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Philosykos was my introduction into niche perfumes. I told the SA that I was looking for something green, grassy, nature-inspired, and she handed me this.

It opens with a green, astringent, split open live branch. It's fresh, hyper-realistic vegetal note that immediately conjured up a lost memory.

The memory of me walking around the fence perimeter of my childhood playground. Listening to Pearl Jam's Ten in my Walkman while the rest of the kids played on the jungle gym.

Yes, I was the weird, introspective, artsy kid.

In the corner of the playground, I noticed some sappy fruits peaking through the fence from a fig tree. At the time, I didn't know. My curiosity was piqued and I picked the fruit and opened it up. The branch produced a milky sap. I recall the forest green leaves, like sandpaper. I tasted the mildly sweet, jammy fruit without reservations.

This was the age of innocence, curiosity, adventure, and when the entire world was at my fingertips...the carefree days before technology became commonplace...the days when children played outside and not behind a screen.

To me, this perfume is that memory in a bottle."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","This is the second perfume I ever bought! I spritzed it on my arm when I was in the store and was thinking I should at least wait a couple of hourS before making any purchase decisions. I could not stop sniffing my arm in the first 10 minutes and then I went back to the store and bought it!

It starts with a very green scent, like crushed leaves and then the fig and creamy coconut start to emerge. It smells like a Greek garden. And to me, this is what heaven smells like. :)

The only thing is it sometimes smells a bit too sour on my skin. But that maybe just my body chemistry. I spray it in my hair instead and it does not have any sour notes.

Longevity was not long but decent - in Asia it is usually quite hot so it fades in a couple of hours. I do not mind reapplying and smell the green again. Spillage was also quite okay - I got waves of figs, leaves and coconut when I move my head."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","A tropical candle but in the best way possible. I get a creamy coconut milk and fig leaf scent. It's fresh, green, a bit sweet, and most importantly it doesn't smell cheap. This smells like a candle but in perfume form. It smells like its meant to be worn on skin and not synthetic like some perfumes can be (like they would be better suited as a candle/room spray). This smells like a summer safari in the rainforest but such a memory that could be accessed any time of year without smelling out of place. I'd want to wear this any time of the year, even in cold weather where I may need a bit of a pick me up to remind me of sunny days and the beauty of nature when all our trees are withered away and the wildlife is hibernating.

I can't stress enough how ~Natural~ this perfume smells and feels. It's one of the most high quality tropical scents I've ever experienced. I'm currently on a no-buy but once that is finished and a few more bottles leave my collection this is at the top of my must purchase list, and a big bottle at that."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","The ""clone"" from the Body Shop does not even come close! Don't waste your $19.99 on it."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","The more I try other figs, more I appreciate Philosykos.
I use to climb fig trees as a child and this is the closest one to the real deal. And the only one I can tolerate in the long run.
I'm not sure it should be longer lasting, the fixatives used just blur the naturality of the fruit or even worse, leaf. Feuille de Figuier from Roger & Gallet is great example, the benzoin, almost tonka-like, mellows the aromatic sharpness and that green bite, but it gives surprising longevity. It's also the question of taste. And priorities, I suppose.

And for those who complain about coconut, the fig leaf sap really smells milky and coconutty and also very green, aromatic, woody and it's an intense love or hate story."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I sampled this at SpaceNK. I initially enjoyed the scent but within an hour I had to scrub it off my skin as it made me nauseous. Even though there are ""green"" elements, I found the overall scent to be too warm/sweet. I felt it didn't have a deep enough basenote to balance the fig or coconut."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","WOW, really green. I get bare a hint of fig and coconut, it is all green leaves and wood. I bought this because it was close in notes to Fico Di Amalfi but you could not get a more different outcome.

-----

I've played with it a bit more now and the top notes are a deeply wet green which is refreshing, and given time the creamy Coconut comes through to round it off. It's a lovely scent, absent anything floral or citrus, and very natural/true to life. It's really growing on me, for those times that Fico Di Amalfi is too citrus sharp and Italian Summer Fig is too synthetic floral."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","This is not a safe blind buy to my mind.I get some peach in it but mostly smells like a bunch of dandelions with light coconut,reminds me of childhood. Not sure if I want to smell like dandelions.Very green though."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Lovely scent that disappears in a couple of hours, smells similar to premier figuier extreme but with less performance and higher price tag. Too expensive to be spritzing all day"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Finally got chance to try this at Barney's. After having read so many positive reviews, I was very curious to do so. And I must say it lived up to the hype. Very lovely. Maybe it is because it shares notes with my favorite perfume, Hermes Un Jardin en Mediterranee. Both have fig leaf. Here, the the fig leaf is accompanied by the fig fruit and fig tree (now THAT is a lot of fig!) I would like to have some extended time with this one. If it has better longevity than the Hermes, maybe it can take over first place in my heart (nose?).. Fig lovers ought to like it a lot."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","This fragrance touches my heart and my eyes fills with tears when I smell it! Maybe it reminds me of good memories from my chidlhood? I dont know. Philosykos extremly beautiful perfume. If someone don't like it, maybe they are in trouble? It is just sentimental."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Extremely green and very fresh and leafy. This has to be the greenest fig - not at all fruity, compared with the Artisan Parfumeur's fig. A classic, but not for everyone. If you like green notes just grab it thought, you are not going to regret it."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Green, transparent, clean and creamy. Could be a rainy day scent, very similar to quadrifoglio without any of the herbal dewey notes. I'm not a fan of coconut but this one is done nicely. A woman would smell lovely wearing this."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","A benchmark green fragrance. Ultra realistic. A soft and short affair but undoubtedly beautiful. A must-try.

Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I'm sorry for myself to believed all these reviews saying its a great perfume. I put my high expectations & blind buy this. But, I dont like the smell. it's like living in a jungle. I dont wanna smell like jungle in the office. Who would? Nice bottle thou. That's all i can say."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","""Yo dawg I heard you like figs. So I made a perfume with fig leaves, fig tree sap, fig fruit, and with pictures of figs on the bottle"".

If you've grown up near a fig tree like me, you've probably been told not to go very near the tree because the leaves and the figs can make your body incredibly itchy. Needless to say, I had my little misadventures near the lovely fig tree. Followed by a thorough scrubbing under the shower from my mother.

This is such a realistic and 1:1 recreation of fig that my body phantom pains the itchiness to itself when I put it on.

Personally it's not really my cup of tea. I'm not a fan of ultra natural smelling fragrances in general. But hey if the ""Yo dawg"" statement above applies to you, by all means go ahead and enjoy Philosykos!"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']",Very realistic fig scent. Opens very green and then turns sweeter smelling. Very fresh and enjoyable scent. Longevity and sillage are not impressive. I've tried both the EDT and the EDP. They smell the same to me and the EDP lasts a little longer and is a little more potent than the EDT. I probably will not purchase a full bottle because the performance is not that good. Womanity and Fresh Fig by Lauera Mercier are two other fig scents that I really like that have way better performance.
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Philosykos was my gateway into the world of niche perfumes. I don't know how diptyque does it but they manage to pull off the most organic, natural smelling scents. So far I've tried Eau Duelle, Do Son, and this.

This one is my favourite, such an interesting green scent. The opening is really fresh, you smell the woods and the leaves mostly. Then the drydown seeps in and it's all about jammy sweet fig with milky coconut. SO lovely and natural smelling you almost forget it's a perfume, I will definitely be grabbing a bottle in the near future."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","The best fig fragrance because it is actually not a straightforward fig fruit but rather a more earthy, woody fragrance. For me it is a smell of sand, some sun, some fruits. So calming and beautiful and very grounded. One of the best fragrances ever made. I have Premier Figuier which is sweeter, sharper and more like green unripe figs. I don't even think you can compare the two as they are in fact very different."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","If you think you've smelled the best green scents out there, try this.Probably the most realistic green scent you'll ever come across.
It literally smells like green leafs on a cold summer day. And not in a floral way either, just plain green leafs. So realistic that you smell like you just crushed some green leafs in your hands and rubbed it all over you."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Will keep this short and sweet.

Very green fig fragrance with a hint of woods in the background. Its linear and very simple.

Performance - low sillage with moderate longevity. Hard to overspray this one or be cloying. Hard to see this offending.

Verdict - Thumbs down for me. What I enjoy most is the slightly woody base coming through rather than its key player fig note. Although I like greens I dont like this take. For the price I would look elsewhere.

Disappointing but I'm glad it was only a 5ml decant and not a full bottle purchase."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I always thought this perfume was too sweet in the wrong way. So right now I layered it with eau duelle, which is sweet in the right way, and voila! Great mix of their 2 modern classics!"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Perfume is so much about memory. Different notes strike different chords and trigger different associations, linking past and present.

For me, this fragrance is so discordant, two totally different scents, two totally different associations. Each by themselves interesting but together, like an orchestra out of tune. Maybe if you've spent time in a fig grove this scent makes sense to you, or is possibly even genius, but to me, I'm totally baffled. I've tried it three times now over the course of six months.

The top note is the problem to me. On one side we have the bitter smell of ripped leaves. I love ripped leaves -- it transports me to my youth, hiking through mossy damp forests, building forts out of large sticks, making clover bracelets, smelling a sweet dandelion, stumbling upon a random rhododendron bush, finding a wild blackberry bush and eating everything thats ripe. If you're not the hiking type, imagine ripping up arugula or kale and crushing it with your hands (but not so spicy), and then rubbing it all over your body. Ripped leaves range from sweet to bitter -- these are far on the bitter end. To go with that, I'd like some moss, some rose, some dirt, some pine, some salt and musk.

Not here. On the other side of this, we get a sweet blast that's like a coconut vanilla lollipop. Way too sweet, and maybe should match with pineapple, or lime, or something acidic. I eat figs, I like figs. I've eating a variety of figs in different countries around the Mediterranean, little figs and figs as big as apples. Good figs are like expensive honey, not like coconut. I do not get fig fruit at all. But whatever, fig, coconut -- whatever it is, it's just okay.

But I cannot put these things together in my mind. Ripped bitter leaves and this sweet smell do not harmonize to me. Ripped leaves are so close to my heart, and the sweet note is like dumping corn syrup on the forest floor. Of course more people like corn syrup, but why would you ruin a beautiful forest smell with it? Like an out of tune children's orchestra hurts your ears, this top note hurts my nose. I wondered what the guy next to me on the commuter train was thinking, like, ""this person is insane.""

Two hours later it is settled enough to be inoffensive to me, so I won't wash it off. A very standard, powdery, slightly French die-down.

I'm sorry, Philosykos, I want to understand you, but I can't! Next time I'm in a fig grove, I'll rip up some leaves and reconsider. (This review is for the EDT.)"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","This perfume is very irritating to my nose, it smells just like nectarine/peach stones. It's as if I've just finished eating a nectarine - I keep feeling the urge to wash the smell off my hands. It's funny to see so many positive reviews of this perfume, crazy how our sense of smell can differ so extremely. Unfortunately, Philosykos was my introduction Diptyque perfumes; however on my next trip to the Liberty store I came across Eau Duelle and Do Son.. happy to say I love them and got FBs of both!"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Hallelujah. This became an instant signature fragrance the moment I smelled it! It's a realistic, naturally sweet and juicy fig scent with a hint of brown sugar and fresh cut grass or branches. I struggle with green notes sometimes, but the greenness in this one is so fresh, light and sweet, I just feel like 1 million bucks when I wear this. It's so refreshing for the summer, but there's a depth to it also that would make it perfect in fall and winter. So, good for all seasons if you ask me!

I was lucky to get a generous sample of the EDT at Nordstrom's from the SA. I want it to be just slightly more substantial, so I'll be going for the EDP I think when I buy. This has become an instant staple in my collection - and I don't even have the full bottle yet!

I'm not sure this is a safe blind buy as the fig note is very specific, but I definitely recommend it as a must-try. It's incredibly beautiful and unique."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Funny how we experience perfume so differently. It never fails to amaze me! I tested the EDT yesterday (no idea what took me so long, I know) and the first blast is very sweet and very coconutty. I was a bit surprised because based on the reviews I expected a more green and also a bit more ""bitter"" experience (along the lines of Un Jardin En Mediterranee). Granted, they both feature fig leaf but Hermes does not feature the fruit itself.
However, this is a lovely, unusual summer perfume that's not overexposed and the coconut eventually does mellow out on me. But I cannot help but wonder if there is little Tuberose hidden somewhere. It's a sweet, fruity (realistic) fragrance that translates well from day to night and does capture that holiday essence. I don't get much wood though, completely lost with my BC. I still have a little left and will try it again when it's warmer."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Unfortunately, this reads strongly green on me. I don't get any sweet juicy fig on my skin (which is what I was hoping it would be). Had to scrub it off.

Projection and longevity are excellent."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Phylosykos is definitely a must-have, must-try fragrance of a green FIG-category (along with L'artisan Figue). Green, crushed-between-the-palms fig leaves, you can feel the juicines of the fruit...and it sooo perfect.

That being said, I must confess that the scent is very ""quiet"". It does not give me any explosions of emotions, it is just ..Comfort. The one that you would seek during loneliness, or ocean walk, or Sunday lazyness… I have the same feelings about Vetyverio. Because of that calmness, I wouldn't wear it every day.

Safe blind buy if you like green or fig frags."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']",This perfume is gorgeous and unusual. The opening is lush and green. It reminds of freshly cut grass and leaves and rain. It dries down to a very green fig scent that is earthy in the best way. This perfume is not sweet and I often layer it with Diptyque Eau Rose for added complexity.
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Delicate green fig, airy notes, possibly other types branches and ferns... Nothing heavy or dark here. While I was reluctant to try fig scents after everybodys polarizing views on Womanity this is clean, natural and in no way offensive. I really am going to enjoy wearing my sample on sunny afternoons."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I apologise for wasting space, here, with a non-review (again!), but I feel this is an important message in regard to counterfeit Diptyque fragrances.

I’ve been duking it out with a seller in Russia because I noticed that they are currengtly selling brand new Diptyque items for next-to-nothing, and when I purused their multiple listings’ photos, I noticed that their Diptyque products were all made in TURKEY; ALL Diptyque is exclusively manufactured in FRANCE. These are very well-made counterfeits, but not Diptyque, and the way that people are bidding on these bottles, I’m afraid they’ll end up being re-listed by their buyers, on eBay, for a lot more than their purchase price. Sadly, this seller still has decent feedback, 99% of it from buying, not selling (I wish eBay would stop this practice of feedback for buyers..it’s ridiculous. “Seller paid for item that they purchased.” Yippee, 5-stars all around, for actually buying something you bought. Stupid false-validation, 5-star culture grumble grumble. Yeah. I’m peevish). Unfortunately, a lot of buyers won’t bother to look at detailed feedback, so blinded by low prices for a “new” Diptyque fragrance, and they also don’t bother to look at details beyond the boxes front, and the bottle’s label. Maybe some even know they’re counterfeit, but so desperate to own and display a boutique fragrance, they purchase it anyway. That good old Collection Envy. ugh.

PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT COUNTERFEITING! It compromises brand integrity, raises brand prices, and hurts sellers of genuine (and pricey!) fragrances.

I don't hate it, but it didn't seem to me it was worth all the hype; certainly, not the big price tag. Initial hit is grass (people say fig, i guess) and the dryout is fresh, a bit sweet and overall it is mild and all throughout it reminds you of fresh cut grass.

My take, I wouldn't pay over 200 to smell like my freshly mowed back yard, Mind you, it is still pretty out there, the sun just rose and its first warming rays are caressing your pillow face,there are birds chirping, you can take a deep refreshing breath and feel confident and calm... unless you remember you just spent 200 bucks on a bottle of Phylosykos...."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I tested this because I read it would be like Hermes Un Jardin in Mediteranee, which I love. I found that this was missing that green spicy bite that Hermes has...it's much smoother and I could see it appealing to a wider audience. It's distinctive but not quite interesting enough for me to buy in a bottle; it didn't do much after I put it on and faded within a few hours. Meh"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I love most fig scents, but I believe that while this is a quality scent, it is overrated. It is decent and a good scent for sure. But, it isn't the end-all like some say it is.

While it is a green fig scent, it isn't green from added green ingredients like Noble Fig or Figuier Eden. The green is the Fig tree and has an Ivy vibe similar to Ninfeo Mio by Goutal (but without the cat-pee vibe that Nifeo Mio has). It also isn't too overly coconutty like L'Artisan's offerings.

I think it is worth smelling and seeing if it is right for you! It is a quality scent, and is a good reference point for fig-based fragrance.

But if you are just starting your fig journey here, there is a nice big world out there for you to enjoy. Don't let Philosykos be your final fig destination."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I love fig notes. I love the contrast between the more milky and the greener facets of the perfume. It's subtle, with very little projection, but acts as a skin scent, gentle and inviting. The fragrance evokes an unripe fig, dripping with milky resin. Sweet but not quite edible. Quite natural, but tame and clean. I find it performs best in warm weather, the milky aspect is more pronounced with heat."

On me this is plant fig. It isnt the fruit. This is the plant. dry woody green. the coconut adds some smoothness but does not make it tropical at all. Its a very non fragrance fragrance. Like walking through a tree garden in summer.

It is nice but just not me. I think I would like it more if it was a tiny bit more fruit forward. Or crunchy forward, like the fig seeds.

Very nice fragrance though. Perfect for summer picnic type days."

Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Buy-ability rating: 8.5/10

This is brilliant. It’s so fresh but creamy, smells not like any other fig fragrance. It smells of green if that makes sense - the fig leaves and the trees.

One of very few scents to transport me to a place - I just get the Mediterranean, sat in a vineyard sipping wine overlooking the ocean.

The smell is divine.

Projection wise, it’s not going to grab the attention of people walking past outside if you’re layered up with a coat. However, if you stood a couple of places behind someone wearing this in a queue at a coffee shop, you might just smell it.

I get decent longevity with it, although you might need a top up if you planned on wearing it for a full day at work for instance.

Not an evening night out scent. Definitely more of a warm weather scent (although I wear it in the office sometimes regardless of the time of year - it can be a great pick me up when it’s wet, cold and miserable outside!) . I also love to wear this just chilling st home. Anywhere really. But you wear this one for yourself rather than because you want others to smell how great you smell.

In summary: amazing smell, one of the best, not the strongest, but you wear it as an almost skin scent for yourself, decent longevity, not the most versatile as it is a warmer weather daytime fragrance predominantly, but could be worn in doors any time of the year, not overly pricey either for smaller bottles.

An 8.5/10 on the “buy-ability” scale. The smell is a 10/10. The price (and the slightly weak performance) knocks a point off the buy-ability scale though."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","So, after wearing this perfume for about a month, I am here to review the EDP.

This is a masterpiece. It is beautiful. I even bought a full bottle!

Philosykos (what a beautiful name) is fresh, green, juicy. I want to stress the wet aspect of it. This is really humid, juicy, watery - but not watered down! And I love all this dampness, it feels alive, it feels like it has just rained, and now it is sunny. The air is still humid, and you are under a couple of fig trees, water drops falling on your face from the leaves, while you eat a juicy, sweet fig alone and in peace.

The main notes that I smell, are those you can see above. A lot of fig leaf and tree, quite a bit of the sweet fruit with a milky and wet aspect. I don’t smell that much coconut actually. To me, it is the fig leaves that have that coconutty/herbal/slightly bitter feel. But it doesn’t remind me of coconut.

This is really photorealistic fig tree/leaf and also fruit. If you have never smelled a fig tree, then take my word for it. This past summer I went to beautiful France (cote d'azur) and it was full of fig trees everywhere, so I learned their particular and unique smell.

The performance is good: longevity and projection are both moderate. This is a people pleaser that won't offend anyone ever. It is light but not a skin scent either! It can (and should!) be worn in the summer without choking you.


Comparison with the EDT:the EDT is wayy lighter (i.e. does not last 2 hours. I am sorry) and sweeter, but not in a sirupy way, it just has more of the fruit I think. The EDP has a way better performance, it's more wet, and it has a bit more of the bitterness of the leaf. I prefer the edp."

Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I was recently offered Philosykos as trade for my bottle of Angel. Despite the notes not reading much like anything I currently wear, I decided to go for it based in part on its cult following, and also the fact that I just wanted Angel far, far away from me.

I haven’t explored Diptyque before. I subconsciously associated the brand with the type of person who’d post a photo of themselves on social media in their impossibly white living room (furry throw rug optional), looking all faux casual and real smug, feigning deep thought with a caption about “self care” and “gratitude” and “being true to yourself” while they drink a $15 Moon Juice.

Sorry, my issues are projecting themselves all over the place. Point is, this perfume ended up being a perfect example of something you expect to dislike becoming an instant love.

Philosykos comes off so simplistic and clean, yet there is something deeply comfortable and reassuring about it. How can something be so crisp and creamy at the same time? Green, but a juicy, fragrant green that suggests both the tree and the fruit itself. This fragrance makes me feel very put together and approachable, and wears like an expensive cashmere cardigan over a cheap t-shirt and worn in pair of jeans.

I guess this is my initiation into the cult of Diptyque."

Imagine cold indian summer morning, sun is slowly rising, a woman is drinking her hot tea with coconut milk while looking at the sunrise through an open window, while cold breeze brings in the smell of freshly cut moist grass.

Now I don't know how fig leaf smells like, so the freshly cut grass is probably the fig leaf. Tea note is not present here, but the contrast of warm milky coconut and cold wet greenness is. As the sun rises and the smell evolves, it gets warmer. A masterpiece.

Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Friend of the fig. Judging from the notes, the fragrance seems meant to embody the entire fig plant - from the soil to the wood to the fruit to the leaves, and even the dew on the leaves. I have never been around a fig tree (and probably never will) but I believe Giacobetti did an astute job of capturing the essence because I now believe I am having the full fig tree experience.

The opening burst is all coconut, dew, and fig fruit to me. Did you know fig fruits aren't considered vegan because of the wasps inside? Quite a zing. The zing is apparent in the opening; what many would consider sharp and green, but rounded out by the sweet fruitiness. The coconut and the fig complement each other well; the coconut bolstering the creaminess of the fig.

Heart-wise, I tend to wish that the woodiness in the back wasn't present. Overall, though, it adds to the fragrance feeling like an organic, natural fig tree experience. Again, I smell this without having experienced the fig tree. But I want to. The fig -- the sweetness and dewiness -- continue throughout the drydown. All of the ingredients seem extremely high quality.

Overall, definitely worth experiencing and probably worth buying. I wear this on days that are warm and sunny and I am not feeling warm and sunny to make me feel warmer and sunnier. Very beautiful and realistic. It may not always be the most opulently dewy fragrance one wishes, but you'll always find it intriguing and refreshing. And it's just sweet enough. Kinda like Jeff Goldblum."

This review is for the eau de parfum. At the opening I smell a strikingly realistic fig leaf; woody, green, leafy and vegetal. After about an hour fig and coconut become more prominent with a gentle woody backgound; maybe a hint of figgy sweetness. It may sound strange but at the opening I was reminded of a freshly plastered and painted room.

Lasted about five hours with average performance. Philosykos is usnisex leaning feminine; for fall, spring and maybe summer; not especially sexy and fine for work. I enjoyed this scent quite a bit. It's pleasant and easy to wear all while using less common notes. I will admit the fig leaf was a little off putting at first but it doesn't stick around to long. The realism of this note is impressive. Philosykos is often referenced online as a model fig scent and I can understand why. Everything smells natural and high quality. I even like the bottle. It could perform a little better but it's not outrageously priced. Nice scent from Diptyque!"

But this is gorgeous as a hyperrealistic rendition of pure fig and coconut. Like something that tastes delicious. And gives me access to smelling gorgeous without the discord of not wearing a dress to go with it.

So for that uniqueness in my collection. I'm very happy to have a bottle. I like to wear it to work out or to take a walk or for lounging around the house.

It's very natural smelling. Mouthwatering.

It doesn't last all that long. 4 hours on me. But for this type of scent I can just load up the sprays and it's never overpowering and I don't mind the shorter longevity.

This is a juicy, buttery and delicious mixed scent of fig leaf and slightly unripe fig that makes you want to eat it. Seems very natural and authentic indeed.

In the drydown it turns slightly woody with cedar or even sandalwood as a co-star. A little sweet as well, but not overly so in any way. Very green and totally unisex. A little too heavy for hot summer days, but perfect for slightly warmer spring or fall days.

Sillage is moderate and longevity unfortunately not much better. Projects for 1 to 2 hours and the skin scent is completely gone after 4 hours.

This one is sweeter and more fruitier than the EDP one (as i remember)

I want to mention something not mentioned yet in the reviews of this fragrance. In every fragrance's explanation on Diptyque's site, there is this ""olfactory accident"" expression - it is a term the house created and as i understand, this is the effect of what the perfume reminds of every now and then while sniffing. For this fragrance, black pepper is stated as an ""olfactory accident"", which i can totally agree but on my skin it is more like pink pepper or white pepper, without harshness of the black pepper. This is the effect appearing for the first half hour.

Afterwards, soft woody notes like sandalwood appears. And it leaves skin losing the green part and letting the soft woods play their role.

Yes, Jo Malone Wild Fig&Cassis is more about fig leaves and not-yet-ripened, green figs; its floral components make it much softer, well-rounded scent. But Diptyque has it own style and sharper appreciation of fig. When i smell Diptyque's, i think of the tree even with its roots, and Jo Malone makes me think of the little fruits in between fig leaves.


Today i also tried layering it with Byredo Blanche, they go well together, it becomes a clean and fruity green scent. The musk and florals in Blanche break the ""greeeeeen"" screaming effect of Philosykos. Also the pepper part combines really well.

Fig was a ground-breaking note a while back. This perfume is an original. Its a milky, green fig with a bit of sandalwood and coconut. I have the EDP and can't really comment on the ETP. This one performs awesomely for a fresh scent. I couldn't get over the compliments I received on this one. Most people who approached me said something to the effect of how different the fragrance was. All feedback was positive. I don't live for compliments, but I confess I enjoy getting them.

I've literally never smelled anything as beautiful as this scent. It's my favourite and I treasure it. I never knew I loved the scent of fig until I bought this lovely perfume.

It lasts well enough on my skin and longer on clothes. For me, the scent is close to the skin but it's fine because I don't mind perfumes with low sillage.

I will always love this perfume.

This is a really fantastic green fragrance that smells exactly like an unripe green banana peel. I was quite astonished and amazed at how evocative the scent of this fragrance is to a banana peel (not the banana itself, but the peel). Perhaps fig leaves smell like that? I actually don't get much fig at all in the fragrance. It's just very green smelling. Sillage is moderate (on the ligher side) while longevity is also moderate (nothing special).

My only wish is that it doesn't disappear completely but it really does. It's gone completely by the end of a working day.

It reminded me of the beaches of Herzliya, Israel. The smell of memories on sand as a child in one of the most beautiful places.
I had to buy it, even though I wish I got some of the discontinued Diptyque fragrances that were still available at the time.
I find Philosykos to be complex, and it changes quite a lot. It can be fresh and light, and it can become somewhat heady and heavy in its own way. It is fruity but also woody, it has some sand notes and coconut, but I also always detect some metal notes in there that I like.
It stands the test of time, and manages to be better than Giacobetti's other fig concoctions becasue it is less straight forward and less linear. Beautiful and eternal."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Philosykos is a three stage experience.

The opening is a green, sweet, and hyper-realistic aroma that will forcibly put you smack dab in the center of a lush wood; leaves on the ground beneath a canopy of branches, saturated in last night's rain. Every time I spray this I'm taken back to a single, otherwise untouchable moment of my childhood. It might not be your thing, but you'll probably love smelling it either way.

The second stage of Philosykos is delicious coconut, which is a smooth transition that still carries remnants of the initial opening. The smell of rich coconut draped in fig is heavenly.

The third and final stage of Philosykos is a disappearing act, and it comes too soon. Just like that, in the second or third hour, it's gone. Vanished without a trace. It is the only disappointing aspect of this fragrance for me.

Of course, that's the kind of problem that can remedied with more sprays, as I often do. It is a wonderful perfume packaged in a beautiful little bottle; a bottle that, if you enjoy the scent as much as I do, will end up draining way too fast for comfort."

I started with a sample of the EDT, in harsh mid-winter, and fell deeply in love with the scent as it transported me to green springtime.

My bottle of the EDP arrived in mid spring. Not the same fragrance - and I don't think I've had the EDP long enough to fully appreciate it. I’ve only worn it 4 times in this warm weather. On me, it is ice cold, and there is a sharp, icy/freezer burn note that remains through the drydown. I would best describe it as a melancholy version of the EDT – darker and less green. If the EDT is a warm spring, the EDP is a bitter winter. However, the sillage and longevity are markedly improved – yet it’s far from a powerhouse.

If you loved the EDT but want improved sillage and longevity, the EDP is an OK fix – but there are some definite differences. I would strongly suggest sampling both before buying."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Philosykos EDP starts off with a sharp, fresh, green accord. It has a lush, wet vibe to it with an earthy element like a fig grove after a spring rainstorm. As it develops it becomes warmer, creamier, and the coconut comes to the fore. There is a little spice in the base and it lasts fairly well, but not a silage monster by a long way. This a spring and summer fragrance, and if you want a summer holiday fragrance that has coconut without being sweet then this might be the one for you."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","This one is for the EDT.

I'm so dissapointed because I don't get any single greeness what so ever!!! All I get is coconut. Coconut milk to be specific. Kind of like a coconut scented body lotion or something, but without the sweet vanilla note its often paired with. I don't really know what fig smells or taste like so I can't comment on that specific note whether it's evident or not.
I'm not sure if i'm anosmic to green notes or my skin doesn't pick up green notes in perfume, beacuse I had the same experience with L'ombre dans L'Eau (EDT).

I may test this again to verify because I can't belive what I'm smelling.

Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","For EDT and EDP, I would prefer the first one. Compare to one is fresher, the other is warmer (both just a little bit, they're almost the same.) I favor Philosykos' refreshing opening more over the drydown. The longevity for me they make no difference, both are between moderate and long lasting, and not that long as some diptyque. Here price is the most important factor, for EDT 100ml is still far more not that expensive than EDP 75ml.

I won't say DP's performance is good enough, still it's my salon signature, the after shower first choice.

Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","TOO ""green"" and smells almost like ""pot""/""weed"" on my wrist :))) because of the UNBALANCED ratio between the ripe fig VERSUS fig leaves, fig tree, green notes and coconut. Many people told me that green fig can smell like marijuana. I did not believe until I actually experienced it myself. The large percentage of fig leaves, fig tree, green notes and coconut in here actually takes away the sweetness of fig itself and turns this juice into something VERY ""green"", ""aromatic"" and rather ""herbal"" to my nose, which is a big NO for me :) It actually reminded me more of Victoria's Secret Bombshell In Paradise.

I LOVE the fig in Jo Malone Wild Fig & Cassis Cologne the best! And this one does NOT even come close to that discontinued ""legend""! The fig leaf in the discontinued Victoria's Secret Dream Angels Halo EDP is also very feminine and fresh (with soft, gentle, and non-offensive green notes)."

The bliss of earth´s natural fragrances.
Philosykos Diptyque captures about 30% of what a real Fig leaf and Fig fruit smell like. I know it in my heart. This is not a real fig fragrance in its entirety. This synthetic product definitely hints around its advertised theme but is far from it."

Philosikos (EDP) was my second fragrance from the house and at first I didn’t love it. It seemed a little thick, but fleeting. I was wrong, pleasantly so.

This opens so green, like the leaves of the fig tree, but soon develops into the fruit along with some coconut. It is rich and lasts a long time. I get whiffs of it all day when I wear it. I feel like it sits close to the skin, but I like that with a scent like this.

All in all I think this is a great Spring scent."

Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I am obsessed with Philosykos. The few times in the past when it has been recommended to me, it never quite caught on —- I think because I couldn’t get past the super green opening notes. It always smelled too herbal or leaf-like.

However, when I tested a sample recently of the EDT, I fell in love. It really warms up on the skin and just blooms. There is a fresh fig, with a milky (lactonic?) quality about it that is just so soothing. As others have noted, it does also have a coconut smell to it — not like a pina colada, but like fresh coconut. It is just so fresh — and makes me yearn for spring and summer.

There is a resemblance to Marc Jacob’s Men, but the MJ has a somewhat synthetic, cloying quality that Philosykos does not have.

My only complaint is the lasting power is not too long when sprayed on skin, so I actually just purchased the EDP, and will give that a go as well.

Perfect for all occasions. Love!

ETA: I love the EDP even more! It is less “green” and a little warmer — just perfect for the tail end of winter. Love it!"
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I tried tonnes of fig perfumes, mostly because I love fig fruit, especially when it comes freshly from the tree. I know how it smells. Before I get Diptyque Philosykos, I thought ""This will be the next horrible, non-fig smelling fig scent"", but you know what happend? First time I felt the fresh ripe fig, exactly that one I love to eat from the figtree. After I sprayed I smelled grass, or crash leaves, it was very green, and I smelled fig and coconut. After 15 minutes I feel the fresh fig, less green and less coconut. Its a beautiful composition, a positive disappointment. My new love. Now I understand why many people love it!"

Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","If I had to succinctly describe this fragrance, I would say that it is the scent of fig tree leaves and branches - bright, woody, green. It does not gender signal at all in the usual and lazy way most mainstream fragrances do. That is to say Philosykos doesn't resort to one of a handful of familiar aromachemical combinations that one would associate specifically with male or female marketed fragrances in order to reassure you that you are in the correct gender aisle at Sephora. It is unisex. Whether you find fig tree leaves and branches to be masculine or feminine is entirely on you.

In my opinion, Olivia Giacobetti's particular magic is found in her ""green nature"" creations - fragrances which evoke dewy leaves and grasses, woods, earth, and water... without dunking them in a muddle of perfume-y affectations. She finds a way to make ""nature"" wearable. Philosykos, along with Preparation Parfumee Andree Putman, are really top notch examples of such work."

I got it recommended by a friend to try it out. Came to this page, saw people said it is similar to the ""The Italian Fig"", went to my local Body Shop and smelled it. I liked the smell of it on my skin but was not entirely sold. The next day I see a Philosykoks EDP on sale and said to myself that it might be a big upgrade so I did not know what to expect from it. I directly go with a blind buy because of the good price and good reviews here, I spray a bit on my neck and scarf.

The scent disappeared after only one hour. Was a bit sad but I said maybe because of the cold weather outside. Once I got home sprayed before sleep and disappointed to say that the scent disappeared more quickly than I fell asleep.

Tried again in the morning before work. Got only one hour out of it. I like the scent, it gives the feeling of ""rustic"" and takes back you back to a place where time stands still and the sun burns with passion. But the performance is very low on my skin and even clothes. Sillage is very soft on my skin and performance under one hour. Would not recommend for blind buy or for those who would like to stand a bit more out of the crowd. Keep this one for personal uses around the house or gardening."

Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","The coolest think about this is how starkly realistic it smells.
Because of that the previous reviewer said it's not very wearable.
That's a good question. I think it's more wearable and enjoyable for men perhaps.

L'Artisan Parfumers makes the most creamiest fig that leans feminine by B. Duchaufour, it's called Caligna I believe.

My review is further below. This has a lot of fig wood smell, and a nuance of coconut softens the stark dry greeness of Philosykos. It's just a good refreshing smell for me.

Diptyque has become my favorite house recently, I'v gotten to know most of their fragrances.
Philosykos is one where it's very worthwhile to get the EDP. The scent is about the same with edt, but longevity is frustratingly short. EDP longevity is solid.

I'm genuinely impressed by the ability to capture the smell of a green fig. It reminds me of shopping at the farmers market and brushing up against a crate of figs at the outset of the season.

That said, I enjoy the experience in a clinically interested way, as someone who loves to cook. I don't want to smell like this."
Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","I spent 2 weeks in the Abruzzo region of Italy this summer, visiting family. Everyone was feeding us figs (white/green and purple/red), there were too many to eat. We were in heaven and wished we could take them home --- good figs are super expensive where I live. There were bowls of cold figs in my aunt's refrigerator every morning. An older man came up to me and told me that he was my 2nd cousin, and he hadn't seen me in 20 years, and that he had figs to bring to us later. We were swimming in figs.
So imagine sniffing through the duty-free shop before flying back, sad to leave central Italy behind, and you casually pick up this little black solid perfume tin that is so much heavier than it looks...and you open it and packed inside are bushels (that's why the tin is so heavy!) of fresh and almost-ripe but still-a-bit-green figs. So I was able to take the figs home after all!
The coconut note is barely discernible to me and only serves to warm the scent a bit, or add a dash of cream to it. My only complaint -- this fragrance disappears too quickly."

Initially, I get the burst of green when spraying it in which a bit too quickly turn into sweet creamy coconut smell. I was expecting this to be fresher and woody but what I get didn't disappoint me at all. Definitely unique fragrance to add to my collection, the drydown is absolutely lovely.

And as everyone probably mentioned my only complain is the longetivity of this frag. My skin naturally eats up scent but this one only last about an hour then it's completely gone."

I don't tend to like overly sweet perfumes. This has a clean fresh scent, with sunny green leafy notes, that glide over a nutty and buttery undergrowth - which the woods and coconut add to the blend. I was surprised to see coconut listed, as I didn't quite pick it up the first few times I wore it - but it's understated and works so well with the other elements of the fragrance.

A gloriously and curiously harmonic perfume."

I have a large collection, and wear fragrances maybe too often, to where you start to get tired of them, and they become more unimpressive.

This has a refreshing anti-perfume effect for me. It's transportive to where I feel I'm in the woods and just peeled the green bark from a fig tree and put my nose in it, wonderfull!

But this is wonderful, evoking fresh green leaves as well as fruit. Likewise, coconut can be too tropical--pina coladas and suntan lotion--but this is to that as coconut water is to Coco Lopez cream of coconut, if that makes sense: light and refreshing rather than cloying. On me this starts out quite aquatic, and then the fig and coconut start to emerge, but it remains fresh and green. The wood is subtle, adding just a slight warmth--I guess it completes the fig tree. Overall, a wonderful surprise and I especially love how it evolves. Guess I am a fig fan after all!"

I was comparing philosykos and Cassis&wild fig (by Jo Malone) hand by hand.

I noticed a subtle calone note at the top of philosykos, whereas the Jo Malone's creation has a much more milky sweet blast at beginning. In fact, that airy calone stays on, lightening up the whole perfume.

The body of philosykos is green and...aquatic, it's almost ethereal compared with the aromatic, even balsamic undertone of Cassis&wild fig. Also there was a nail-polish-remover vibe in the whole Cassis&wild fig."

The EDP is strong, heavy fig, with more waxy coconut; I find the EDP somewhat oppressive especially in the first hour, but it may be just right for someone whose skin eats fragrance.

The other half are partially dead from the drought and heat. Exaggerating, but it seems nature is telling me not to live here.

Imagine my surprise. I was getting rid of some brush when I started faintly smelling a very real Philosykos wafting through. There was no one around me and I highly doubt my neighbors walk around wearing Diptyque. I kept smelling the air and discovered that not 10 feet in front of me was an extremely parched fig tree - small tiny green fruit with yellowing leaves.

Let me tell you: crushing those fig leaves creates a smell almost exactly like Philosykos except a little more sharp, a little less sweet, and a little more green. Beautiful, this was already one of my favorite scents even before I encountered a fig tree in real life but now I appreciate it even more!

Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","Philosykos is a wonderful evocation of a fig tree in full bloom - the bitter green leaves, the ripe milky fruit, and the sappy, woody twigs and bark.

At first, I was put off by the coconut - a note that is quite prominent to my nose, primarily because it's not one I tend to enjoy. It all made sense after testing Diptyque's Figuier room spray, however. Figuier is a much drier, woodier, and more austere scent to my nose, lacking a good deal of the lushness that makes Philosykos so beautiful. A lot of that comes down to the creaminess of Philosykos' coconut note, which evokes both sap and plump figs on a branch. It's an utterly necessary part of this beguiling scent.

The EDT projects lightly and has moderate longevity. I haven't tried the EDP so can't speak for its scent or performance.

Overall, Philosykos is a perfectly balanced, very natural-smelling scent of subtle beauty which is eminently wearable. Very Diptyque, and very, very good.

I'll leave you with some fun fig-related facts:

• Figs aren't actually fruits - they're blossoms turned in on themselves, which are pollinated by wasps that burrow inside to lay their eggs
• There are dozens of different fig species, many of which boast their own species of fig wasp
• Philosykos seemingly sparked a late 1990s trend for fig scents, my favourite of which is Dior's strange, shimmering woody-aquatic Dune Pour Homme"

Philosykos Diptyque (unisex) ~ 1996,"['green', 'woody', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'fruity', 'lactonic', 'coconut']","What the drydown overwhelmingly smells like to me....coconut?

I have this in the travel size. The scent is very put together and elegantly mixed, a modern classic if you will. However, I'm not sure if this is what I would want to smell like or would care that others smell like. This is not a scent for me to show my personality. Rather, this is a scent that I think I'd wear for myself to escape from reality.

Despite the green scent that comes from the smell of fig in the first 3 minutes, I would classify this as an early spring / fall / rainy day scent. Although the scent easily reminds me of being on an island with its heat, it also smells very dry just like it. So it doesn't blend well with wearing it in the summer.

The coconut is what I smell most which layers on top of fig, which I really like as I love the smell of coconut. It is not a light, fresh coconut but one that is more dense and milky and even oily."

Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","Initially, Coromandel is nose-prickling, aldehydes, bright and sharp and sour, like a bitter citrus slice of moon on a night when winter is sparingly giving way to spring. It's also brimming with curious camphorous woods and strange subterranean echoes when the first spritz settles on your skin. Soon though, it is inexplicably a dark, floral sprinkle of black pepper atop a mug of palest milky cocoa, smooth and rich and creamy on the tongue, but tinged with that underlying musty bitterness. The strange interplay between those primordial notes and that velvety decadence offers dueling impressions of opulence and austerity; imagine enjoying a delectably elegant beverage…on the damp, cold floor of a mossy limestone cave."

RIP my bank account. For life!!"
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","This seems to be everyone’s favourite. People adore this one. Unfortunately I’m not one of them. 😔

Coromandel has many notes, but is basically a patchouli and white chocolate scent. On most people the white chocolate is so smooth and creamy and velvety that the patchouli becomes creamy and almost a bit chocolatey too. But not on my skin. My skin amps up the patchouli and gives it a really sharp, sour and bitter quality. It’s like the velvety creaminess of the white chocolate accentuates the bitterness instead of smoothing it out.

I love Chanel, but this is not for me. 💔"
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","My bottle of Jessica Simpson Fancy Nights went bad, so I bought a replacement only to discover that it too, had turned. I then decided to stop messing around with Fancy Nights altogether because it's out of production and seemingly impossible to find a fresh bottle online. Instead I bought Coromandel and I couldn't be happier. It's everything I needed from Fancy Nights only fancier, lol! This isn't a serious review but I do think this is a great, multifaceted and thoroughly enjoyable, classy substitute, and it has a sparkling shape shifting character so sometimes it's white chocolate, sometimes patchouli, sometimes rose, wood, or musk... It's really well blended but sometimes individual things flicker momentarily in the light like a dark opal. Thanks for going bad, Fancy Nights! You nudged me in the right direction!"
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","This is so beautiful and I am not a huge lover of patchouli. It's blended so wonderfully, yet it is complex with different nuances weaving in and out throughout the wear. You get citrus, you get creaminess, you get earthy touches, and so much more. Great fragrance!"
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","Dior Patchouli Imperial (2018) vs Chanel Coromandel EDP (2016):

Dior opens up with a wet, cold mold - semi-dry one. Then it slowly sweetens up with tonka bean and amber.
Chanel opens up with a mix of aldehydes (a lot of them), flowers and a pinch of white chocolate (hidden far behind). I cannot smell any singular flower (rose per se or any other). This dries down into patchouli (rather not raw, but not very mild on the other hand) - sweet, cozy and warming; resins and incense (this is in the background but is detectable). The patchouli here gives you chocolate'y vibe so all combined together might smell for some like there is a milk chocolate with cocoa.

In general - Dior is simpler, but its patchouli in general is more ""in your face"" and it is straight patchouli. Chanel is more sophisticated and much more complex.

If you want patchouli as its essence - choose Dior. If you want a more complex variation - choose Chanel."
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","Went to a Chanel boutique and checked out my darling Coromandel, the juice is much lighter than the 2016 first EDP issuance, I still have the 2016 and I'm concerned if the performance has been diluted just like the juice appears to be, I'll probably end up buying the newer lighter juice anyway and cherish what is remaining from the 2016 older bottle. disappointed."
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","What a stunner Coromandel is. So very unisex. If you love patchouli you are in for a treat with this beautiful citrus amber scent..it's full of decadence. It's rich, sophisticated. It's full bodied and dense. Adding the special touch of white chocolate with incense makes it a beautiful gourmand treat done in the best possible way. This is not only a must try but a must buy. It's one of the most beloved fragrances made by Chanel and well known by the community for good reason. It takes you on a journey wanting more and everyone around you will feel the same. Get ready to splurge on this one..don't even try to fight it it's inevitable you two will eventually meet and remain together forever lol."
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","Creamy and earthy and smoky, oh my. Coromandel is warm and enveloping, beautifully out of reach but friendly. The heavy dose of patchouli gives this almost an artsy touch: this is the scent of your elegant but quirky aunt whose house is filled with objects collected during her travels.

In the late stages of the drydown, the patchouli mostly has disappeared and I am left with a lot of white chocolate and benzoin. At that point I do miss some depth, which I why I'll probably make do with the decant I have, but the first five hours are magic."
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","If anyone had asked me which of the Les Exclusifs I would enjoy the most before trying any of them, I would have used Misia, which I do like, but find a bit too rooty and carrot-like to be a love. Because of the large patch note, Coromandel would have been near the bottom of the list. I haven't sampled all of the Les Exclusifs, but I have tried a majority of them, and hands down, Coromandel is my favorite.
I am not sure what alchemy they use to make me fall so deeply in love with a fragrance so loaded with patchouli, but even though it's there and I can clearly smell it, it must be the combination of other notes, especially the incense, oil barnum, benzoin, and the touch of white chocolate that transform this into a supremely elegant and sophisticated perfume, that a full bottle is in my future.
In the meantime, I will have to satisfy my desire for Coromandel with the 4 ml mini, the generous decant I received from darling Ana, and the lot of 12 carded samples I just purchased. I consider this to be a masterpiece, and while there are some who may find the former EDT to be superior, I really don't see how there is room for much improvement!"
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","Coromandel opens so nicely, and I thought I had found a keeper. Alas no, in about 1 minute it turns scanky and musty. Dirty smelling. Someone below said it smells like rotten, damp wood, and yes, is does. If I could find this frag minus that scank it would be full bottle worthy because that creamy white chocolate is just dreamy. Such a shame."
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","Coromandel is a perfume that has the most beautiful opening and lasts beautifully maybe half an hour (beautiful white chocolate), unfortunately later it turns into the smell of a moldy basement (probably dirty, earthy patchouli with benzoin).
I give Coromandel a lot of chances but we didn't find each other, that mold (moldy) bothered me a lot.
Many people love Coromandel, weird and heavy and that is why it is very attractive to perfume enthusiasts.
Very interesting, while wearing Coromandel I got a lot of compliments.
But there were also negative comments - ""that something stinks of mold"".
The performance is outstanding.

I see that many compare Coromandel with Xerjoff Richwood, these are completely different perfumes that have no similarities.
People rely more on the pyramid of notes than on their own nose.
Often perfumes have the same ingredients but smell completely different.

I just realized, it smells like the incense they light in a Thai temple when you're praying for something. If not that, then one of those essential oil or incense sticks they sell in Asia. It's a unique and odd smell. I can't imagine myself wearing it and I can't really figure out who would wear this and in what situation."
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","When I first sprayed this, for a few seconds I thought I'd found my signature scent. It was just beautiful. But this beauty lasted for no more than a few seconds. Then suddenly a strange smell emerged that was both familiar and elusive. Maybe it was the patchouli, I'm not sure. It smelled slightly musky, slightly plasticky, at times almost like paraffin. This effect came and went in waves but each successive wave was more potent and less pleasant. At one point, my son came into the room and said, ""Why does it smell of poo in here?"" It does have a somewhat earthy smell, but I'm not sure that was what troubled me.
It went on like that for hours: pleasant, rich florals and creamy sweetness interspersed with spikes of that peculiar, plasticky musk. I still don't know what to make of this, but it's clearly not for me."

And my aunt’s obsession for women. That’s what I get from Coromandel. To my nose-mind the memories of those overshadows...
I wore it all day and night to give it a good try. And it lasts amazingly well. Just one spray and it dominated all day and night. I did have to wash it off that evening to get away! There’s a classier, more expensiveness to it, but the obsession...can’t do it! lol"
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","This is a very, very interesting fragrance, complex with a multi-fold character. And has a slow development, in the sense that it unfolds many sides of its personality during the time you wear it. And therefore, can match many different tastes.
It starts off aldheidic to me, and right after warm and spicy – I can smell some cinnamon, cardamom also something like pepper or nutmeg? But these spices are “clean”, not so much like the ones you would put in food while cooking. It also has a fresh, almost balsamic note that reminds me of juniper or better sniffed, cedar.

The heart is powdery (iris) and flowery and then there is the patchouli note. I instantly got the same effect as in Voleur de Roses…. Earthy, moist, rotten wood…. Like in wine cellars. The moist cellar note is prominent. That's the green side of patchouli and the rotten side can be disturbing to some.
In Coromandel this mossy moisty hearthy note is not so stingy and pungent (in Voleur de Roses was unbearable to me, had to wash it off).
The combination of the spices, lingering all along the development, are mixing so well with this mossy wooden note that makes me sniffing and sniffing again my hand... it is really gorgeous and such a combination I would love and applause on a man.
Does somebody remember the very first Versace L'Homme (the one w/the tan box and black/silver lettering)?? Well, Coromandel has a very similar connotation in the drydown, for the spices, the mossy/earthy/patchouli note.
To me Coromandel is rather a masculine fragrance, although a lady can wear this as well.
It has also a sort of animalic attraction, that makes it very sexy, in a subtle, unscreamed way.
A masterpiece fragrance, with a huge personality and loads of sophistication.

PS: in no way this is close to Prada (amber)."

And Fancy Nights... which is a favorite of mine. I'll dodge the stones heading my way. But Fancy nights is stronger. Darker. And sweeter. Coromandel is lighter. More complex and smells like a symphony of notes. Whereas in Fancy, I smell a one note hammer bonking me in the head. But Fancy is strong and I like it. My boyfriend thinks Fancy Nights smells like a dentist's office. He prefers Coromandel. He thinks Coromandel is smooth while Fancy Nights is screechy. Yes. And Yes. But I like both. I prefer Coromandel when I'm dressed up, wanting top shelf drinks. Fancy Nights is for when I wanna cozy mixed drink. Bottom shelf. Cause this late in the night. No one cares, or is sober enough to remember. But If anyone asks, I'm wearing Coromandel"
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","I received a sample from a fellow perfumista friend here. Thanks Elisabeth! For the longest time I was very curious about this scent and what all the hype was about, but I wasn't in a rush to get a sample, mainly because I'm not a big fan of patchouli. Still, looking at the other notes, I was very intrigued. As soon as I applied it after my shower last night it hit me that I know this fragrance. Either someone I know wears this, but I can't think of who, or there is another perfume that reminds me of this, but I can't think of what. Of course, I'll probably remember right after I finish this review. LOL.

Anyway, this is a dense, chewy fragrance where the strongest notes to my nose are the sweet creamy white chocolate, a vanilla tinged amber, and an earthy, slightly mentholated patchouli. My immediate reaction on smelling the patchouli was that I was grateful it wasn't that hippy patchouli so common during my youth, otherwise it would have been an immediate NO for me.

Right after the opening salvo of bright citrus and neroli top notes, it quickly evolves into this delicious, sweet, slightly aromatic, musky concoction. I am barely picking up any floral notes, aside from the very clear neroli opening, and only getting a light incense on the dry down. Otherwise, there's not much evolution, but that's okay because this is nice and cozy as is. There's something very comforting about this fragrance that gives me the urge to relax and unwind.

Silage is not overwhelming, but very present, and longevity excellent. I woke up this morning with the scent still going strong. A big plus and somewhat of an anomaly for Chanel perfumes. I don't know whether I'll purchase a fb or not, but I still have a few wears left in this sample that will give me time to decide. But as of right now, I really, really, like it.

Oh, I just remembered the perfume, actually two, this reminds me of. Elie Saab's Le Parfum Intense. Both share the same earthy, mentholated patchouli note, but in Coromandel it is much tamer. Also Shalimar Extrait. The amber vanilla base smells almost identical to me.

Edit - reading through all the reviews and someone mentioned Prada Amber. Yes, I also think this shares a similar earthy patchouli note, though it is not aromatic in Prada."

It's CREAMIER. Like the cream on a red velvet cupcake. And it lasts forever. I actually woke up in the middle of the night, sleeping with my wrist near my nose, and smelled it. It has been at least 9 hours since I tried this on. I'm actually typing this from bed.

Going back in the morning to get it.
Makes me wanna write a book with an old typewriter, in big brown glasses, a soft blouse, and my favorite little yellow-gold earings. Sipping a strong Black tea with sugar, or a deep Red Wine. ♡

I LOVE."

Unfortunately to my nose it smells like a dusty, earthy (probably the patchouli?) perfume with the tiniest bit of incense. No white chocolate, no expensive ""money"" smell or any of the other notes. The dusty smell I get reminds me quite a bit of Elle by YSL, but in Elle it is in much smaller doses. Lasted more than 6 hours on my skin and days on clothes, so the quality is definitely there! I just whish I got the amazing white chocolate scent everyone else seems to get :(. For the price it is probably better for my bank account that I don't like it."

Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","It’s a love from me for this fragrance. I mostly get a dominant patchouli note which has a perfect very very gentle and soft wet soil note which blends with the other notes perfectly. The neroli and bitter orange add a cleanliness to the scent while the resins, mainly the benzoin provide a vanilla-like sweetness. I also smell a powdery rose along with these notes. To me those are the most obvious notes and add up to an amazing fragrance. It’s very sophisticated with a ton of depth. I’d also argue incredibly unisex. I could easily see both men and women pull this off. I think as soon as people smell a powdery fragrance they immediately want to classify it as feminine. Try this one on skin and wear it through a day and I’m sure you’ll reach a different conclusion! It’s very potent for the first couple hours and then becomes a moderate projecting fragrance for a remaining ~6 hours."

Sillage and longevity are strong. I am not a pach head as pachouli-dominant perfumes often get musty or screachy on my skin. This is my style if pachouli!

Frankincense and dustings of high end white chocolate with an undercurrent of perfect pachouli. I can't imagine someone not liking this scent. Equally delicious on men and women, any age. I would avoid in hot weather, but otherwise an all occassion scent for me.
The one downside is a synthetic note in the current edp that can be irritating/headache inducing if I over spritz."

Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","Chanel Coromandel EDP opens with a strong projection of sweet, citrus, green, floral, ambery, and smoky notes. The opening is classy, projecting, elegant, intense, and pleasant. The sweet citrus, and the patchouli, and the opening dominant notes. The bitter orange, neroli, and citrus notes come across as mildly sweet and sour, with a light white floral touch, fresh. Quickly, the patchouli climbs to the top of the pyramid with its very intense, earthy, musky, herbaceous, green, mossy, and persistent accord. As the citruses start to vanish, the floral notes develop creating a pleasant note, just one step behind the patchouli. The combination of these notes creates a powdery, sweet, aromatic, and white floral accord. Towards the dry down, the amber, and benzoin make the fragrance sweet resinous, these resins seat by the side of the flowers. Similarly, the white chocolate creates is a sweet touch but its gourmand aroma is overpowered by the intense patchouli, and floral notes. In the final stage of the dry down, the musk and woody notes develop. The musk is a projecting mild powdery accord, inoffensive, noticeable, but not as much as the incense, and olibanum. The incense is a smoky note, but not churchy, it sharpens, enhances, and projects other notes; the olibanum add its fresh, incense-like, resinous, green pine, woody, and spicy touch. The woody notes are there to provide support, noticeable but not featured. The fragrance has little but noticeable opening to dry down changes, the opening is mostly citrusy sweet, with patchouli and floral touches; as the fragrance moves to its dry down, the citruses take a third or fourth place, the patchouli takes the first, the second is occupied by the floral notes along with the now fully developed sweet, dark resins, the musk, and the mostly sweet white chocolate. At its dry down, the fragrance becomes dry and slightly powdery. Once Chanel Coromandel EDP has reached its full dry down, it can be summarized as a strong projection, green patchouli, sweet, resinous, dark, floral, and musky fragrance with woody accords. The fragrance feels bold, casual, classy, commanding, complex, dated, dark, delectable, dense, dry, earthy, elegant, exotic, expensive, fine, floral, formal, fresh, green, harsh, heavy, herbaceous, high-quality, intense, mature, musky, nocturnal, old-fashion, old-school, mildly persistent, powdery, resinous, refined, smoky, special, sweet, unisex, woody, and pleasant.

Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","This is known as the patchouli Mecca for patchouli lovers for a reason. It’s spicy, earthy, rich, and deep with the white chocolate adding that creamy richness to the composition. It still retains that powdery base and sparkle that Chanel is known for. This reminds me of a spicy, smooth, creamy dessert. It’s very well balanced and powerful but still soft and you have to love Chanel and appreciate the sophistication of a grown adult fragrance like this. Tastes change as you age. I still appreciate many fragrances of my youth but I’m growing into more serious fragrances but might not want to wear a grown up fragrance everyday. I save this for certain occasions."

I sprayed the sample on my forearm and let it sit to see if it really changes up to a more amber/woody style but, it didn't.

This one reminds me of the other powdery stuff, like Feve delicious ( for example ) but this one in that regard, is not as baby powdery, but still powdery and soft.

It's nice & pretty and is a little too mature for my liking. Reminds me of an older mans aftershave of sorts.

A woman, I think, could pull this off better than a guy.

You have to like this style of fragrance to really appreciate it because for me, it's a pass.

I went to the Chanel store, and surprisingly they gave me a free sample. I sprayed it, and thought this is such an easy wear. The opening is classic, sort of earthy, warming and just ""easy to wear"". The notes blend very well. The projection is mild. This is next level niche. More than anything, it's just an easy wear, and there isn't anything in this fragrance that is annoying or sharp. If you love a well rounded patchouli, this is great. Special occasion frag like a wedding. For me, Coromandel is a close encounter type of fragrance."
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","*sigh* Coromandel.... where to even begin. 4 years ago I purchased my first 10mL decant of this creation. My initial reaction was confusion.... why were there so many glowing reviews? Where was the white chocolate? This smelled like dirt. Wet earth and lacquered wood. I didn’t get it at all. But I was intrigued and kept sampling it.

Well, 2 decants and 2 mini bottles later I am committed to a full bottle. I crave this scent every time the weather gets cold. It’s amazing that no one else seems to comment on the realistic lacquered wood smell that the citrus top notes and the patchouli combine to make. Truly a work of art. The opening is a literal Coromandel screen. My grandmother had one when I was a child, and I recall the scent distinctly. This wood/lacquer/wet earth initial blast is the part that has been the most challenging for me to love, but also the most addictive. There’s truly nothing else like it.

After the top notes fade, I get the most glorious white chocolate amber mix with just a hint of incense. This is not quite gourmand to me, nor is it boring by any stretch. There’s character - a framework of sturdier notes to provide depth and richness to the white chocolate and benzoin.

I’ve attempted other patch-chocolate-gourmand-ish scents, and nothing can compare. I truly wish I’d have saved my money and just committed to a bottle of Coromandel immediately. Coromandel treats me to a sensual, elegant, and rich fragrance experience. Highly recommend!"
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","What can I say that hasn’t already been said? I owned the Prada EDP and Jessica Simpson's Fancy Nights and this STILL won me over. I initially thought they smelled identical but Coromandel has something really addictive, captivating, and creamy from start to finish. Compared to Coromandel, Prada EDP seemed very dry and chalky while Fancy Night seemed very screechy and sharp. So the mid notes and dry down of this frag are really what makes it special.

I love this but it took me a while to learn how to wear because I am always self-conscious of clearing out a room with my bombastic fragrances. You can wear this and get noticed without badgering people over the head with it. I like to put it on an hour before I leave and avoid my neck and wrist area. Trust me, people will be able to smell you."

I just found a small sample vial that was gifted to me last year but I had not yet opened it until just a few moments ago. I wouldn't normally review a perfume so soon after trying but my fingers felt the urge to fly to these keys after the first few intoxicating sniffs. The Patchouli is prominent from the get go but it stays mellow and is only a tiny bit scratchy. It's grassy and almost fizzy and floats above the rest of the notes like an earthy cloud. Below that the Benzoin, Olibanum, smoke and amber lay on a bed of shaved white chocolate. A subtle muskiness melds it all. None of the citrus notes stand out and the floral is subtle and balancing but nothing screams. Coromandel is just my cup of tea, balmy, dark, mysterious...vampiric. I need to start saving up for a bottle. If you don't have the funds, as another reviewer noted, you can find a close bargain version in Jessica Simpson's Fancy Nights...not nearly as smooth but a close bargain alternative."

I could get fancy and try and untangle the notes, but really I can’t - it’s that well blended and unlike anything else that I’ve tried. This is what I want to smell in heaven. A complete ride or die.

Totally unisex, and I wear it whenever I want, I find it comforting, warm and elegant. I’m under 30, who cares."
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","Coromandel for me is a very interesting fragrance that represents a milestone in my fragrance journey so to speak. It is the first fragrance I have bought that is relatively expensive and it is also my first blind buy.

What really made me curious about the fragrance was both the story behind it and the white chocolate note, ever since I was a kid I have loved white chocolate and as such I knew I had to try this at one point.

I must admit that upon my initial spray I was not particularly impressed and was a little worried I had made an expensive mistake. My mother, who is a big Chanel fan, has always told me that Chanel fragrances need time to settle so with her advice in mind I reserved making an immediate judgement. The initial blast opens up with a very sharp note, which I suspect has something to do with the bitter orange/citrus.

Fast forward about 1 hour and the sharp note that I disliked had dissipated. Further the fragrance started developing into what I was hoping for in the first place, a more creamy woody scent that was rather comforting. The incense note also became increasingly more noticeable and reminded me of a church somehow. It is never overpowering but really compliments the buttery aspect of the fragrance nicely.

Is Coromandel what I was expecting when I bought it? No, it is actually better in my opinion. I was expecting a fragrance but instead got an experience. Coromandel has changed the way I look at fragrances no joke.

Since my initial wearing I've gone on to wear it a number of times and each time I am left with the same comforting feeling. My mother has also worn it multiple times and I love it on her just as much as I love it on myself.

I do not recommend blind-buying expensive fragrances as this but if you have even a slight interest in Coromandel do yourself a favor and get your hands on a sample, I'm certain you won't be disappointed."
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","I'm not sure why I get a Tom Ford Beau de Jour vibe initially and a bit of Nasomatto Pardon as well. I don't really get any white chocolate personally. I get some citrous notes in the beginning with aldehydic notes. Then in the dry down I get incense and musk with a hint of sweetness. This was not what I expected prior to trying it. I could see that this is a very versatile scent. Could be worn all year round in most occasions. It's personally not my kind of scent because I'm not a fan of aldehydic scents, but I can see that it could be pleasing to many people."
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","The impression I get from Coromandel:

You have been digging up a patch in your garden with your friend/significant other, so you could plant irises next to your rose and jasmine bushes. You take a break and sit at a table, drink some fresh orange juice and have bits of creamy white chocolate ever so slightly melted by the scorching sun as a little snack.

There is a last bit of a treat sitting on the plate, you hurry to pick it up but your friend wants it too and holds on to the plate as well; you engage in this cute little squabble and continue to pull the plate back and forth until the treat goes flying and lands on the very patch that you have freshly dug up.

You both realise what you’ve done, run towards it, fall onto your knees. The sun has been shining quite heavily, so the chocolate, soil, iris bulbs are all warmed up with the kiss of a sun – this is what Coromandel smells like.

The patch mixed with orris root is this earthy smell of fresh damp soil, which is very strong and can be overpowering at the beginning, and juxtaposed with the sweetness of the benzoin quite confusing. In the drydown it is mostly ambery/benzoiny almost vanillic, with delicate accents of patchouli, orris root, maybe rose and jasmine, however they are very distant.

It is a long-lasting scent, however, the projection is only strong at the beginning, then it becomes a delicate reminder of a sweet aftertaste of white chocolate. If you like Mugler's Angel, this is probably a step-up in quality you might want to consider."

A refined smooth blast of patchouli kicks things off followed by the most gorgeous frankincense accord that I have smelled in a fragrance. This is followed by white chocolate and a beautiful rose note. These notes are a marriage made in heaven.

The lovely enchanted blend is quite strong for a few hours with the incense leading the way for dominance over your nose. Eventually the beautiful scent calms down and the incense takes the backseat as the white chocolate and patchouli gently take over.

The projection and sillage are decent and I get about ten hours longevity.

Picked it up again today and POW it hit me how delightful it is. Not exciting, not challenging, not ""artistic"", just delightful. This is a very pleasant fragrance, and sometimes that's exactly what I need.

Smooth like cashmere. Spicy, but neither hot nor invigorating. Warm, balanced, and charming. The white chocolate note is not as toothachingly sweet as Guerlain's Elixir Charnel Gourmand Coquin. The patchouli doesn't hit you over the head like Angel, and the sweetness isn't as over the top as Angel Muse.

I'm on my third spray of the day (sample size) and the citrus notes are rounding out the spices so nicely. This one may be next on my shopping list.

Update: I drained the sample vial and committed to a full bottle. No regrets."

The EdT I also love, but I don't own that. I've discovered that the longevity issue I had with my first bottle doesn't persist here and it actually does last longer than 15 hours. I purchased this again a few days ago and gave it a good shot last night and am adoring it. May be for only special 'I want so much creamy, kinda funky patchouli' moods that can't be satiated by Coco Mademoiselle. Be wary, though, especially in the dry down this can be a bit too much and projects insanely. This is still a glorious fragrance and the quality is phenomenal, I think I just wore it a bit too much and need a bit of breathing space."

Sweet, but not too sweet thanks to the patchouli and citruses notes.
After a few minutes, I get kinda powdery vibe, which reminds me a bit of Tom Ford Noir EDP.

It gives me that cozy vibe, like a hug in a bottle. Love it!

However during the past year, I have grown to love this.

Coromandel EDP is fantastic for someone who wants to be taken seriously, but also wants to appear approachable. I find that while Chanel N.19 is a scent for a cold boss lady, Coromandel is a scent for a independent woman with great authority, but also with a warm heart.

Not the biggest compliment getter as the scent is a bit odd (in the best way possible), however once a lady said I smelled incredible at the gym, 6+ hours after applying a few sprays. My boyfriend also adores this on me.

Lovely, sweet, warm, elegant. The sweetest patchouli I have ever tried, mixed with woods, dark, old and mellowed, resins, a note like beeswax, chocolate (melty sweet mixture of milk and white chocolate, not the earthy dark one), and something like caramelized jam.

Elegant but edible, gourmand but perfume-y, both comforting and sexy. Well done!

Like a warm blanket. And I mean, the most luxurious blanket you can think of.
A sunny winter Sunday. You, your loved one and your adorable pet, on the couch watching a romantic comedy under a luxurious blanket.

I haven't smelled any other formulation than the latest one. And to be honest I'm tired of the fact that half the reviews on this website are about possible watering down and how it was always better before.

I like the fact that it isn't so strong.
This moderate level of projection suits this specific scent. If you want to project all day, get a pocket spray. And even that way you'll get your money worth. This blend is so high end, round, full, magical.
It smells like quality. Like old money.

Edit: this is the best! I want to bathe in it! I can't wait to get my hands on a 200ml bottle. Then I can feel less bad for over spraying. This it so comforting you guys!

Edit 30/08/20
I got into this in January so I've never experienced this in the fall. . I know it's still summer but today is a fall like day in Belgium. 17celcius, rainy. Coromandel really shines like this! And it projects today like never before. So happy. Bring on the fall!"

Zegna's Indonesian Oud is so strong that I start with just one or two sprays which are good for the entire day and amps up the rose, woods, and patchouli in Coromandel in addition to adding a clean soapy vibe. I then spritz Coromandel as the day progresses. I love this combination.

Have some fun with your collection and experiment by combining Coromandel with those fragrances that have notes in common in addition to adding other desirable complementing notes.

What are some of your favorite Coromandel layering companions?"
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","Direct test EDT vs EDP:

EDT opens up with a huge punch of aldehydes (which are not listed on the notes breakdown). Except the opening the fragrances are almost the same. EDT is much louder, has a quite big patchouli/chocolate punch.

EDP on the other hand opens up much tamer and smoother (what I prefer). It seems to be much more woody and smoky. There's a lot of incense hanging around. Also there seems to be more benzoin hanging around.

In general EDT seems to be fuller, more round and full balanced, EDP might seem to be more quiet and tamer, but I smell it different.

To me EDP is more elegant and much more fits as an office fragrance which you can easily wear for a business meeting. EDT is too loud for that - at least for me.

EDT seems to be more mature, 40+. IMO EDP is more like 25+. for me.

If you prefer more patchouli - choose EDT.

If you prefer more woods, benzoin and incense - go with EDP.

The EDP seems to be more unisex leaning towards fragrance for men, EDT on the other hand seems to be more like a fragrance for women leaning towards unisex. In general both men and women can pull off EDT as well as EDP."

It’s so universal, I feel like anyone between 18 and 108 could wear this, man or female. It’s classy but within reach, familiar yet not basic, great longevity but close to skin after a couple hours. The dualism of patchouli and benzoin is so comforting that you could take a bath in this. The scent doesn’t evolve much after the first 30 minutes and what’s not to love about it? Also the way this lingers on clothes is heavenly.
Expensive, yes . But worth every penny"
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","Chanel Coromandel EDP

Opens up with a mix of aldehydes (a lot of them), flowers and a pinch of white chocolate (hidden far behind). I cannot smell any singular flower (rose per se or any other). This dries down into patchouli (rather not raw, but not very mild on the other hand) - sweet, cozy and warming; resins and incense (this is in the background but is detectable). The patchouli here gives you chocolate'y vibe so all combined together might smell for some like there is a milk chocolate with cocoa.

The longevity on me is 12 hours, sillage is good for 4 hours, then i sticks to the skin. I go with 2 or 3 sprays, I don't need any more.

I can see why some smell resemblance to Mugler Angel or Prada Amber. This is a nice patchouli overall but not the best on the market. My favourite patch remains Tom Ford Patchouli Absolu."

Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","Review for the edp. First off, I love this fragrance. I’ve heard so many good things about it, and it didn’t disappoint.

Coromandel is, in my opinion, a white chocolate and vanilla gourmand with the Chanel dna. There is a patchouli note here, but on my skin, the patchouli disappeared very quickly during the dry down. It turns into a sophisticated powdery white chocolate, and stays for a long time like that. After almost 12 hours, it turns into a vanilla. It has quite the longevity, and will only be completely gone with a shower. The projection is so-so, not overwhelming. The gourmand notes are never too sweet or cloying, and I mention the Chanel dna because I can somehow detect a similar feel to my Chanel no. 5 parfum in this. I feel the patchouli isn’t overdone here, and it makes it much more versatile if you go easy in the sprays. Truly a masterpiece and a must-try for Chanel and gourmand lovers. But I advise testing this first before buying because the patchouli note may be a turn-off for some."
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","I finally got to sniff this.

My interest in this fragrance was piqued when I heard about it a few months ago. Just the name alone; its representation. Coromandel is a type of black lacquer wood, generally, seen in Asian panel/screens. Coco Chanel apartment famously feature a coromandel screen ( first seen by myself in the 90's Coco Perfume Advertisement)

I could already smell Coromandel as I learned about it's notes, and the notes are what I assume they would be--Incense, Woods, Sweet notes. I know it would be in the same line as other great Asian influence fragrances such as YSL Opium and Estee Lauder Cinnabar.

Which has me contemplating the uniqueness of Coromandel. Today, 2019, no one is doing this. I consider this to be very vintage. Actually when I first heard about it, I assume it was a hidden Chanel fragrance from yesteryears. ( it only dates back to 2012 or something).

Though I love Opium and Cinnabar, would I wear Coromandel?? Probably not. There;'s something about it that's just not me . Something very green in it that off put the spices and incense. It's strong, musk oriented---nothing soft about it. Coromandel reminds me of a harder and surprisingly sweeter Sahara Noir-Tom Ford (wasn't that hard enough)

However, a fragrance like this needed to be in the Chanel repertoire. It condones Coromandel expensive price. Chanel Coromandel is good stuff, --- the whole concept,-good stuff. You should definitely give it a sniff.

6/5/20: purchased and wearing"
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","Just received my decant and I'm really enjoying it. I was given a task to choose one perfume for Christmas, and oh, boy, what a job! lol
I went to a Chanel store and tested many of the Les Exclusifs. My intention was to choose Sycomore - which I already knew - , but its resemblance with Vetivert Guerlain is so striking that, IMO, it would't worth investing in a full bottle. Finally, above all, Channel 22 grabbed my attention, so I decided to apply in myself to feel how it evolved. Again, I found it very close to White Linen, thus... same story.
At the store, I didn't like Coromandel, since I felt it smelled like, at first, cocoa butter (the white chocolate people mention here), then wet soil, then nothing.
But with my decant at home (that I have previously ordered), now, I better understand Coromandel.
At first, it has a vibe of Angel, yes, maybe because of coumarine. Later, I feel the wet soil again (patchouli, surely) mixed with some powdery notes. And, to Finnish with a flourish, a delicious woody base notes. For me, it's a combination of sandalwood, vanilla and vetiver (I'm surprised no one has never mentioned vetiver, it's so apparent for me).
I'll use my 10 ml decant for the next weeks, and I'll update my impressions later. But this is a potential full bottle for my next purchase.
Edit: after several full wearings, is a drop off for me. I recognised a strange smell from my childhood, in the kindengarden. It was acrious, sour and pungent. In this kindergarden, there was a piscine with sand, that we delightly played all afternoons. It was only after decades later that I recognized this smell as... cat pee! Obviously, all the cat in the neighbourhood around mt kindergarden would make theis need in our field of games... go figure. At first, smelling this in coromandel was nkstalgic. But later, unbearable. Searching for comments here i find none. Am I the only who smells cat pee in coromandel???"

Tough for me to pick out individual notes, but smoothly blended.
It's not a screamer, and longevity is only average at best on me, but when you get a whiff of the scent when you move around, you realise how good it is.
One of those you wish they made a 30ml bottle of."

My first impression: it reminds me of Chanel Pour Monsieur Eau de Parfum (2016). A tamer version that is. Much tamer.
More suitable for women. Soft delicate scent and projection. Soft but solid. It does last.
12 hours later it was still noticeable on my skin. But it keeps remind me of the male powerhouse. The vanilla like sweetness.

My husband just returned from Sweden & Switzerland and made a special visit to the Chanel Boutique in central Stockholm and bought me a 200ml bottle of Coromandel edP (such an amazing surprise).

I have been wanting this for a while, but for some reason (lazy, lol) I have not driven to our local Chanel store in (not far away) Beverly Hills, CA.

The notes have been discussed by a lot of reviewers, so I will not bore anyone with more talk on specific notes. When I put Coromandel on...it is a combo (on my skin) of: Jessica Simpson Fancy Nights, Mugler Angel, Chanel No 5 and Shalimar. There is also a slight smokiness or woodiness that makes this not a sweet gourmand fragrance, but there is some hidden sweetness, that I am crazy about!

Coromandel is just incredible, and I am so happy Chanel markets this as Unisex (as ALL fragrances are)! If you like it, wear it ;) Longevity is very good, but not excellent. I get about 6 strong hours (much longer on clothes though) and projection and sillage are soft, but now weak. I am totally in LOVE with Coromandel."

It opens in a less spectaculat manner - as others wrote, there is no patchouli blast, so it seems less woody and less intense. I went for a walk around the store and a few minutes later my beloved smell was back. I asked my husband if I should get a bottle regardless of the missing big bang in the beginning. He hugged me, smelling my neck and hair, and said: well, we, at the first sight, might not seem as attractive as we used to be, but you know deep inside we get better and better everyday...

On one of the first days I wore this perfume, I had about 12 strangers or acquaintances come up to me and say ""what are you wearing...you smell incredible!""

I was turned on to Coromandel when someone told me it might be a more affordable alternative to ""Portrait of a Lady"" or ""Musc Ravageur"" both by Frederic Malle. Does it smell similar to either...yes! Is it an affordable alternative to either...sadly, no!

It's the jasmine that captures my nose (I adore Creed's Jasmin Imperatrice Eugenie) but this is ""thick"" or heavy jasmine, which at times smells almost like rose. I'm sure the introduction of patchouli is what makes this stuff smell so ""heady"" to me...not hippy dirty like heady...heady in a good way! The overall blend and balance between all the glorious notes is what makes this fragrance work so well, IMHO. And (fortunately) on my skin, I do not detect many gourmand notes (chocolate?) at all...don't even wish to think about it...the chocolate that is...a bit of vanilla in the dry-down is there for sure!

To me, at no time does one singular note seem to over-take or overwhelm the fragrance (okay...perhaps the patchouli does try from time-to-time). However overall, this fragrance is a wonderful balance of all the main notes, beginning to end.

And YES...this stuff is costly but longevity is great, silage is (obviously) superior and the overall experience is lovely.

I think I will always own this fragrance though.

Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","On my skin, it opens quite masculine with the lead of resins and frankincense, accompanied by a noticeable patchouli supporting note, as well as a hint of vanillic sweetness (supposedly white chocolate) and a hint of smoky incense.
After an hour, a dark (but clean) patchouli blooms, the resins and vanilla go in the background, the frankincense and incense fade out.

As I said before, the opening is pretty mineral/frankincens-y. Added to the patchouli, which is typically a masculine note, one may thinks it is a fragrance for men, but no, Chanel manages to keep it unisex thanks to the vanilla background. So I would say that the opening is unisex leaning masculine, while the drydown is totally unisex. Projection is good in the first hour, then becomes moderate. Longevity is above average. A very luxury smelling fragrance, best for formal occasions.

As for many of Chanel creations, it's a beautiful fragrance, but a horrible price. Will probably get a split though, because i need it in my life.

Besides the patchouli dominant note, the rest had me baffled...but the entire blend had me loving it. I can’t tell if this is earthy, or gourmand, both??? Doesnt matter, because this works on me. My wife liked this o me, but thought it was too masculine for her to wear.

This is an experience. I recommend getting a decent of this like I did and checking it out yourself. I will be saving up for a future purchase."
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","I won't lament over the differences between edp and edt. Plenty have done that already. I've accepted the change and embraced the edp as its own separate fragrance because I wanted to give it a chance. I wasn't ready to give up on Coromandel.

I didn't expect the edp to live up to the original, like I said I'm treating it as it's own scent. But man. In doing so I'm equally as disappointed in its lasting power as I'd been had I never smelled the edt. And projection? This is where it's hardest for me not to compare. It's really poor, and I say that with sadness not anger. I get 20 minutes of a beautiful opening and past that I can't smell it in the air around me anymore. I don't have a sinus infection and I'm not anosmic nor a smoker. After an hour my nose has to be half an inch from where I sprayed to detect anything at all. It lasts 6 or 8 hours, but what good is it if I can't smell anything without pressing my nose to wrist?

I'm adding my two cents to the jar. Had I never smelled the edt for reference I'd feel the same way. Chanel is laughing their way to the bank with this one. Buy yourself Mademoiselle Intense, or better yet Prada Amber Intense and save yourself the disappointment."

Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","I can compare the Edp vs Edt because I remember what the Edt smelled like when I went to Saks Fifth Ave on 5th Ave New York in 2010-11. The Edt was the same fragrance the only difference was that with the Edt it was more sparkly on the tops with the citrus opening and it was a stronger fuller version of this fragrance...This one seems watered down and more masculine because the citrus notes are missing more.. In a sense I do miss that from the Edt and that is what made it very special the sparkling citrus notes that balanced the fragrance out so it wouldn't smell like it was watered down..why they changed that I don't understand.t..I'm so sad about all these reformulations..but more than the reformulations because we know it must happen just the direction fragrances have turned lately..they don't even feel like fragrances anymore but colognes..

Now the Edp does still have the citrus but it's more toned down and you get more of the patchouli, benzoin, white chocolate from the get go. I believe men could pull this off even more now because without the sweet champagne citrus affect it is more on the masculine side but it still is unisex for sure..so both sides can enjoy this equally. As the Edp dries down you begin smelling more of the incense and it is so comforting. You can also smell more of the citrus now but that tones down too and it's not sparkly..but you can smell it. It's interesting that in the Edt you smell the citrus right off the bat and strong almost like the feel of champagne but in this one it comes in more in the dry down. I like how this develops because with all the notes it almost comes off smelling like it has honey with the mixture of the benzoin, white chocolate and incense. Mind you though I miss the Edt version and I wish I had bought this back then but I have to let the Edt version go and just enjoy this scent for what it is..As a collector of fragrances I had to have this classic in my collection but after I finish my bottle of Coromandel I am debating if I will ever repurchase this ever again because the magic it once had is gone. Don't get me wrong it still smells wonderful better than all the designer fragrances that have tried to copy it and maybe I will repurchase this if I can't find the Edt version for a fair price.. but if you think this smells amazing try getting your hands on the Edt..you will be amazed at how much more different it is from this one.

Update: I have been testing this out more and more..even though I know there has been a change in this formula...I have to admit I still love the scent of Coromandel...perhaps it's growing on me..I think knowing the EdT beforehand has spoiled me a bit but I'm trying to appreciate this fragrance more...as I test this out I get exhilarated and I realize I do still love it..if your a Coromandel fan you will love this..it's classy and pleasing..I'm drawn to patchouli scents like this..so much so I would stock up on scents with similar patchouli's like Prada Amber intense and Fancy Nights..and buy back ups..I think I need to be realistic that I am just drawn to this scent and Coromandel is in a class of it's own when it comes to a strong patchouli scent..I love Mugler's Angel for the same reason and Coromandel is still refreshing..though the Edp might be heart breaking to many of us who loved the Edt..the heart of the fragrance is still there and you will love it at the end of the day..don't lose hope in this fragrance..its just as lovely and will grow on you.I will only use this on special occasions and the other versions for everyday use since they are not that expensive in comparison to this fragrance until I can get a bigger bottle.. for now the 2.5oz will suffice."

Based on enamored reviews and promising notes, I bought a bunch of samples so I could really get an honest feel for the fragrance and wear it plenty of times before investing in it --as I fully planned to buy it. But then I smelled it.
The most sour odor of mildew and dirt hit me in the face. Yes I can smell the white chocolate which is nice, but the rest of this fragrance smells exactly like wet clothes that have been forgotten in the washing machine and left to mildew for several days. Just dank, moldy and dirty smelling. I suspect the patchouli as a culprit. I was gagged by this fragrance --and I'm no lightweight, I like Tom Ford's Black Orchid well enough (which also has a slight dank, dirty vibe).
Every now and then I spritz this on again in the hopes that I'll smell the magic that everyone else does --then I have to go violently scrub it off.
Very disappointed. I was reluctant to review this fragrance, but it serves as a reminder never to blind buy anything no matter how adored it is or what notes it lists."

but coromandel change my mind

first blast with citrus that rapid gone away in few secs
follow with heavy patchouli and woody that didnot good for my nose

but after few mins the white milky chocolate note came out
if u smell in the air it's great great blend with other note

you need to smell it in the air because
if you sniff it nearly the skin the earthy woody note will strike your nose heavily
like other patchouli frag IMO

truly truly unisex"

When I first got my nose on the sample I ordered, I was struck by its similarity to Fancy Nights by Jessica Simpson, which I also own and love. Fancy Nights does not have the decadence and luxurious tone that Coromandel has, however, they are both amber heavy and beautiful in different ways.

Coromandel is very ethereal yet striking, loud yet quiet, current yet classic; it's certainly a juxtaposed composition in many ways. It doesn't leap off the skin and fill a room but is quietly intoxicating and certainly has an inviting quality. As far as notes go, I get amber, patchouli and a tiny hint of white chocolate.

I think I need to buy a full bottle soon!"
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","I tested this at the Chanel Counter in Fenwick, Newcastle (should that be the channel coonter?) I digress.

First impressions? Lord above. Way too powerful!

It was a boxing glove at high velocity. A cacophony of notes so crowded into each other that it felt like standing at the front of a Metallica concert with your head in the Marshall speakers at 11+.

I moved away with great speed, waving the spill in a desperate attempt to disperse the perfume equivalent of a Prize Wrestler.

However, some time later, I retrieved the spill from my pocket.

Oh, regrets! I was chastened, filled with remorse for my previous hasty recoil, for Coromandel had slid, ever so gently into a diaphanous veil of incense and confection, the like of which I had never experienced before!

Not my usual balance at all. I was confused that my fragrant bete noir, namely patchouli in any other guise than on it’s own, as an oil, was in a mix, with something decidedly vannilary/gourmand, making chocolate sheeps eyes at me. I was loving it, playing olfactory blind man’s buff in this current of fragrant joy.

It is always a mark of genius when the notes become so enraptured with one another that the whole formula takes on a life of it’s own, like a colour you cannot imagine, or a sound no one has ever heard before. Something so alien and beautiful, you can barely imagine it originated on earth. I must take it as read that the notes are; citrus, rose, patchouli, vanilla, incense, orris, benzoin, olibanum, neroli, jasmine, musk and woods. Seriously. I get some beautiful, edible flower which only grows on Pandora. I have no words. To quote Ellie Arroway in the movie “Contact”; “No words, they should have sent a poet”.

In all my years of sniffing, inhaling, tasting and testing, I have never come across a successful match of patchouli and gourmand. Not ever. Not until now. I don’t think anyone else could have managed it. I suspect witchcraft. Yes. That must be what it is.

It’s an amazing perfume . I have to run away from myself for 5-10 mins or so after spraying, I still don’t like the intense bitter jetstream which first leaves the bottle, but the progress through to and beyond drydown is so worth it.

Strangely, I have had no compliments. I have to put this down to the ladies hereabouts favouring the modern fruity candyfloss perfumes which proliferate the shelves in Fenwicks (the best parfumerie in the North East), and the fellows seeking out the magnetic intensity of kebabs, craft beers and bacon sandwiches. Nevertheless, perfume is for me, so they can all get stuffed. Literally. With candyfloss and kebabs. I have Coromandel, and, we are in perfect harmony and, for the time being at least, totally in love."

Definitely unisex but there are moments in it's development where is leans more feminine and vice verse. The white chocolate seems like an odd choice of note but works really well. It doesn't take it too far into gourmand territory and it adds a nice creaminess to the whole composition.

Coromandel lasts for a long time but the projection is typical Chanel; it creates an aura around you rather than invading the space of others. And this aura is quite potent for many hours.

I've not tried the EDT but I cannot imagine how it could be superior to this EDP version.

Buy with 100% confidence as this is liquid gold and is one of the rare luxury items that is underpriced in my opinion."

I used to own the EDT which was truly gorgeous on me. The EDP, however, is a whole other creature. Holding out to own it again, I'm always going into Chanel and annoying the SAs by squirting a bit on my knuckles or gloves. I've been quite depressed lately and this is really lifting my spirits. The warmth in this is just so irresistible. I sprayed some on my gloves yesterday and I can still smell the patchouli and chocolate. Its lasted longer than the EDT ever did and I need something like that for a fragrance like this. Its blended so meticulously that it's hard to describe it by any other way than 'love'. Woodsy, possibly birch, amber, orris & benzoin are what I get from this mostly.
This is a rare case of me much preferring the EDP to the EDT. It's heady, but calming and a true 10 out of 10.

Where the EDT was like Fancy Nights, the EdP doesnt strike me as similar to anything. There is this gorgeous supple rose in the dry down that I almost faint when I smell it.

This is Chanel elegance, and this is superior to any scent I've ever tried. 8ve have had many fragrances and seen even more come and go, this always holds a place in my heart even though I can no longer afford it."

Well blended and well behaved woody oriental: smells expensive and refined. The woods and incense base last past the 6 hour mark on me. That said, due to the cost I will not be adding to my collection.

I have several that I love in this price range, so even though I really like it I will be passing. If I had to sum up the reason why, I'd say that it smells a little too perfect, and mature. Like this would be an excellent choice for a beautiful woman in her 60s or 70s. I know that might seem abstract, but that's the over all feeling Coromandel gives me."

I’ve been a bit worried about the reform and have wanted to try the edp to compare, and finally had my chance today. So here’s my take: it has changed and it does smell different in the opening. It has a strong medicinal tone to it that caught me off guard, but it does slowly morph into a recognizable form of fragrance I know and love, even if it isn’t totally replicated. The notes are perhaps better blended which for some I suppose is a good thing. I personally prefer to be able to pick out the individual notes through the life of a fragrance. It also doesn’t seem as smooth and creamy- if the Fragrantica pyramids are correct, perhaps the vanilla accord used in the edt was creamier toned than the amber that replaced it for the edp.The verdict: yes, it has noticeably changed especially in the opening, and the scent seems to me to be more linear and less multifaceted. Yes, it is still good. Yes, I will be able to replace my edt with the edp without therapy, because it retains that patchouli meets iced gingerbread thing that drives me crazy and keeps me over spraying (get over it, coworkers)."
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","I'm ashamed to say I've never really smelled the EDT version.
However, I've recently been sampling the EDP & today just acquired a 200ml bottle. So far, I'm really digging Coromandel EDP. It's right up my olfactory alley.
Coromandel is an oriental perfume that packs a very serious punch. And I mean this in the best way possible. It doesn't come off as loud or powerful on the first spray, but rather subdued. However, the aroma only intensifies as the minutes go on, and by the 30-45 minute mark, Coromandel is finally at it's peak intensity (on my skin anyway). It smells powdery, smoky, nutty, and balsamic. The ingredients all blend very well together, and the more pronounced notes, such as the patchouli, stay at the top even through the latest phases of the dry down. I apologize if I am sounding too technical at this point, but Coromandel really is the type of scent that commands scrutiny.
To sum it up: FUCK YES.
This is soo sexy on my skin and even sexier on a woman. It is not made to be liked by the masses, but it is so good that most would like it. You probably won't run into someone in public wearing this either, just because of it's exclusivity. Compliments are just bound to arise when you're wearing this out and about. It smells so scrumptious.
The sillage is very pleasant and persistent. It is never overwhelming. The longevity is really amazing. People will be able to smell it on you until is is washed off, basically. I go with about 6-7 sprays to satisfy me. Why not? This could be worn in any season, but I would wear it dressed up or at least when I'm not scrubbin' or just hanging out.
Overall, Coromandel EDP is an excellent offering from Chanel. It is luxurious and intoxicating. It is the highest quality juice in my collection, and is top-shelf worthy. I'd call this a masterpiece.

This leaked a little in my bag and I was in olfactory heaven, a slightly earthy, rich and warm fragrance that would be the absolute antidote to the cold wet weather we suffer in this country. An enveloping air of warm happiness enshrouding you.

I had never smelled such a beautifully blended perfume before and both myself and my bf loved it.

On paper and on my BF it is fantastic, however for some reason on me there is a profoundly sour note. It is just as one commenter mentioned below, my skin seems to turn one of the notes.

The good news is that this eventually dissipates, or at least, becomes much less pronounced after say 20 minutes. It is however very off putting and once noticed is impossible to ""un notice"".

I think patchouli turns quite sour on my skin, its the same with Sisley soir d''orient however the effects are much less pronounced and don't last as long.

It is still a beautiful fragrance, a masterpiece really, starts off incredibly strong with sillage turning to moderate after 30mins, on my skin moderate longevity."

I have a mini of the EDT version and I love how it smells in the bottle and on paper, I still like it on me but my skin makes it a little funky.

Before my skin does a number on it, it smells cool and crisp with a delicious white chocolate note. The drydown is much better but I would love if the top notes worked on me too.

This is it.
I tried Coromandel EDT many times and pondered for years (literally, YEARS) whether:
1) is too feminine for me, a man?
2) is it too pricey?
3) wtf is this sour ending note?

Now all my doubts have vanished.
The new EDP reformulation is just stunning. The patchouli is much more rounded and the base notes are powdery and warm, not slightly sour as in the EDT, which I also loved btw.

It is pricey but it’s also long lasting so I feel like it might not be such a bad deal after all.

Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","I wasn't sure what to expect from this when I purchased a mini bottle. The white chocolate note intrigued me, and the orris root made me think this might be similar to Britney Spears Naughty Fantasy Remix. It kind of is similar! Naughty Fantasy is much stronger though and doesn't have many notes that this one does.

...which is why it surprised me that this is not as strong as I thought/hoped. Not to say it isn't a gorgeous fragrance. It smells SO good. It's not an edible chocolate, but just something that warms up the composition even more. It's a cozy, warm, skin scent, but lasts forever. This is obviously much more complex than Britney Spears, and isn't even comparable beyond the white chocolate & orris root combo. The patchouli and incense make this slightly smoky and herbal. All around a wonderfully blended scent that is very elegant and classy. Perhaps I don't find this to be so strong since I have a dabber bottle and find that many scents perform not as strongly when dabbed vs. atomized/sprayed. I hope I didn't get a fake! It definitely is strong sniffing out of the bottle. I think it just melds so well with people's skin chemistry that it isn't an IN-YOUR-FACE fragrance, but one that envelopes you in its warmth and exudes an aura of comfort and refinement. I think I might decant some of it into an atomizer to see if that helps."

I had a huge trepidation trying Coromandel. I heard it was close to Fancy Nights, something I down wright loathed and put Coromandels exploration on the back burner. Come to find out, they arent related at all.

I feel everything has been pretty much accurately covered regarding the nuts and bolts making up Coromandel, so Im going to take a birdwalk to expand this a bit in a few different directions.

I first sprayed Coromandel, It felt slightly familiar. Matriarch's CoCo Blanc came to mind in its milky chai vanilla wood feel. 1932 edt also resonated with me with its sweet woody vanillic base once again is used in Coromandel, as is the orris note. Angel sprung to mind with its chocolaty patchouli.

Coromandel is indeed beautiful and well done, and it strikes me with its oilbanum, patchouli, orris, and musky woods as a very creamy base driven scent. I might get a full bottle not only for the fact this absolutely blew my doors off as a great scent, but I suspect there is much more to it than this..I think it could also be a tremendous layering component to those that do like to layer and blend their fragrances. I cant wait to layer this under my orientals I already have in my collection."

I get far more olibanum than benzoin, tonnes of patchouli, sweet creamy vanilla which I guess is white chocolate and powder. But, of course, it's more complex than it sounds. Rich, balsamic, heady. It's the perfect scent for me. It's like Obsession but far more refined and fresh and of course without the spiciness which is, in part, what makes it so refined."

However there is a strong camphorish, minty, almost mentholated note that is never too strong or medicinal but definitely present and dominating in the heart notes although it is tempered very well with light woods, amber, and rounded off by a non-sweet airy powdery vanilla. It's a very well balance, elegant, and ""full"" fragrance. I sniffed the tester wands for several of the Chanel Les Exclusifs line and was very impressed by all their offerings, the whole collection struck me as masterfully done.

Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","I did not want to try EdT (now discontinued), because I thought it was too strong and sweet. And I do not like patchouli, so it was a no go for me.

Then I heard that the new EdP was softer, more rounded and patchouli in it was not so strong, so I tried it.

This is a really nice perfume, although I do not think it's too original. Reminds me of something already seen, some perfumes from the past with a typical ultra-elegant Chanel signature. As somebody said, that could be some new Coco Blanche, and I certainly smell in it echoes of Shalimar, Opium before the reformulation, but also mild, much more wearable Angel. It is a true unisex perfume, although you do not have to worry that it is not feminine enough. Durability is very good and sillage is sensational.

I am glad that this perfume for me is somehow a time-track through the past, reminding me of some of the most beautiful perfumes from the golden perfume era, with a modern, elegant Chanel touch."

I felt the incense smoke and benzoin were bursting too sharply well pass the opening. I also found it leathery in a harsh way.
But hours later I felt the drydown was pleasant.
Wearing it again, I didn't find the incense so strong and felt it was quite pleasant as well. These notes (incense, benzoin, leather) give this perfume an originality that is lacking in all the mainstream products and even in other Chanel Exclusifs.
The drydown this time came sooner in a powdery, sweet (but never tiring nor cloying) way.
I also felt the white cholocate note.
This is gorgeous, I guess the first time it just surprised me in the opening.
I looooove the drydown specially, and I will try to get a bottle ASAP, despite the steep price, I feel it's worth it.

Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","I'll get the blasphemy out of the way first: I DO see some similarity to JS Fancy Nights. On the bottle and upon first spritz, I bemoaned that I had in my possession a $200 clone of a $10 celeb scent that you can find on clearance at just about any given TJ Maxx. And yes, that would be an ironically appropriate penance for someone who blind buys shit this expensive, but...

It doesn't stay that way for long, and even while it does, it is so, SO much better. Coromandel is a reference patchouli scent, in my opinion. As we all know, patchouli has a deserved reputation for smelling like a musty hippie shop; Coromandel, on the other hand, is patchouli done in the most luxe possible way. It smells, as many Chanels do, like the epitome of good taste. Or, if you prefer, like MONEY. The fruits in the opening are bright and interesting in juxtaposition to the smoooooth, somewhat dark patchouli, but Coromandel's money shot, for me, is that smokiness from the base. I don't really smell anything that I would identify as white chocolate until the far drydown, but my nose is certainly no expert.

Coromandel is a timeless smelling oriental that leans to the feminine side of unisex; women that love orientals but find that some of them turn quite masculine have nothing to fear here, and men who enjoy sweet scents will be in heaven."

Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","I am very, very disappointed in Chanel for messing with this masterpiece. It is still great quality and beautifully blended but, to me, one the characteristics that set Coromandel apart from other orientals was the contrast between the earthy patchouli in the opening that gradually turned into a sweet and warm amber. Not only the patchouli has been relegated to the background, but this composition is linear from beginning to end, so you never get a chance to fully enjoy it. I am not even sure I would still classify this as an oriental woody anymore. Maybe an oriental vanilla?

I am also quite disappointed in the performance. The previous iteration was unbelievable. If I sprayed Coromandel EdT on a card, the card would smell for MONTHS! And if I sprayed it on my skin, it would still be there until I took a shower the next day. I need several sprays of the EdP to get any kind of longevity, which really shocked me seeing how it is supposedly more concentrated, and it still doesn’t even come close to the original.

I do not know if there is such a scarce supply of patchouli that Chanel was forced to reformulate this fragrance and then decided to change the concentration so that the ""tweaks"" would not be so noticeable; or if all this was just an excuse to charge considerably more per bottle. But, in any case, it is an utter shame.

Again, it does NOT smell awful by any means. Far from it! I own a bottle of the EdP and will continue using it. Also, from what I have read in the comments, many people actually prefer this version and have not experienced any hindrance in performance. I am very jealous of these people because, unfortunately, I can't help but feel extremely sad."

Those who know me know my complete love for Coromandel edt - it's one of my favourite fragrances and I confess I'm addicted to it, I wear it often and know it very well. I know every note, every angle, I know the bones of edt to the point that if I catch a whiff of it on someone (which rarely happens) I feel compelled to put some on as soon as I can. It's a delight, rich, sweet/sharp and note perfect.

The edp is good, very very good and I will undoubtedly buy a fb at some point but whilst it's extremely similar to the edt it is not in the same league as my beloved.

The Edp is smooth, it's obviously Chanel and it shares a lot of the edt DNA- but for me edp is a sister, not a twin.

Still fb worthy though. And yes I do love it, I'm just not IN love with it - that special love is reserved for my edt."

Original has more patchouli and to me a patchouli that is similar to A men. Plus more wood.
This is softer, more feminine yet not as sweet.
It is smooth yet powdery and has a distinct bitterness.

I feel that this smells more like a ""chinese lacquered screen"" than the original does.
Love it just as much.

It is similar to Shalimar with less incense, no leather and instead white chocolate and Benzoin. The white chocolate adds a more modern feel but this fragrance still has that vintage oriental feeling.

It almost defies words how beautiful I find this fragrance. For my tastes, this is the absolute ideal perfume: saccharine sweet, woody, and balsamic all in one. It is somewhat of a lovechild of my two favorite fragrances---Shalimar and Angel. What more could I wish for?

I'm completely enamored by the prominence of benzoin, which in other fragrances of the same family I find myself in love with, but Coromandel more so than others. The white chocolate, however, is the most prominent note to my nose, which I find makes it so unique---certainly the most outstanding from all of the Exclusifs in my opinion. I absolutely adore Chanel's exclusive blends, but to me Coromandel is one of the rarities which actually smells like it's worth nearly $400."

It seems to be a bit rounder, fuller then before. I do miss the complete shift from opening to drydown of the EdT though. That was really amazing. I kept sniffing my hand to see at what stage it was.

Therefore I'll treasure my nearly finished bottle and backup bottle of the EdT. By the time these are finished I'll be happy though to purchase a bottle of the EdP. It's the first EdP of the Les Exclusifs I've tried that's worth the insane pricetag.

Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","If you want a standalone review of this fragrance, just read all the reviews (including mine) on the EDT page. All I'm doing here is offering reassurance about the new EDP, because I guess if you're reading this page, it's likely you're trying to find out if the old EDT is still recognisable within the new, refo'd EDP.

Well, worry not, it most certainly is. As a long-time wearer of Coromandel, I have just tested the EDT (newish version, bought last year) against the new EDP, one on each hand, identical amounts. Verdict? Extremely similar, and both very definitely Coromandel.

The best way to explain what little difference there is, is to say that the EDP is simply slightly richer. The EDT projects its top minty-patchouli notes quite a lot in proportion to the rest of its composition (so in comparison to the EDP it appears to have less depth as it dries down). The EDP's minty-patchouli top notes are as strong as the EDT's, but its mid and base notes are more pronounced; this means the top notes can sometimes feel proportionally weaker.

I also found that the EDP definitely lingered longer than the EDT. I've always found the longevity of the EDT to be pretty good, especially for a Chanel Exclusif, so for the EDP to out-perform it is actually quite good going.

So, all is as it should be in the land of Coromandel: the top notes are more noticeable in the EDT, while the EDP has a deeper, longer-lasting drydown. But both have the same notes and follow the same progression / development, in my opinion -- any differences are infinitesimal... although, fragonerds that we are, we are always happy to spend many hours dissecting these differences anyway. ;-)"

Although they were (and still are) many skeptical opinions about migrating Chanel Exclusifs to the EDP concentration, at least in this case we are talking about a significant improvement.

Compared to EDT version, EDP is more ""reserved"" and abstract, something that characterizes Chanel culture.

If in EDT the notes of white chocolate, patchouli, rose and citruses are, somehow, succeeding one after another, EDP is an abstract composition, and perfume is linear - all notes are present simultaneously in all stages.

Longevity is impressive - similar to EDT, but the projection was much lower (patchouli note was a bit in excess in EDT), a situation which gave the impression of some reviewers that Coromandel became a mainstream product.

I think the current version of Coromandel could be even more successful and in the near future would look good in the ""Coco"" family, as ""Coco Blanche"".

Perhaps it’s the “white chocolate” that does it. I don’t really get that much of the patchouli; perhaps it’s also in there with what I mainly get: a “tonka bean” kind of scent that’s rather too strong to be wearable except in close quarters.

To my nose the EdT was more watery, weaker, more transparent, as if it was a body spray or hair mist edition of the real stuff. I am also acquainted with the old formulation of the EdT, and the EdP is much closer to that version than the latest EdT. Thus, lovers of the old formula of Coromandel: rejoice, it is back in all its amazing glory."

However, after they settle, the similarity is at least 95%; the EdP is more resinous--thicker & warmer--while the EdT has more patchouli & white-choc, and feels more young-ladylike."
Coromandel Eau de Parfum Chanel (unisex) ~ 2016,"['amber', 'woody', 'warm spicy', 'patchouli', 'balsamic', 'citrus', 'sweet', 'earthy', 'smoky']","I find this very similar to the EDT, at least after the first 10 minutes. The top notes are oddly different (I may like the EDP more at this stage), but the heart and base are more similar than different. Once it starts drying down, the EDT I had (version from a few years ago) has more of the patchouli pungency to it than the new EDP; whereas, the EDP is more ambery. I do miss the extra patch (although it sounds like that was already toned down in the newer EDT versions), but it's still recognizable as Coromandel and ""scratches the itch"" for me. I do think the EDP is slightly weaker than my old EDT, but I'm not sure if that's possibly just due to aging/evaporation in my old EDT. Maybe this will deepen/strengthen as it ages? All in all, I'm not disappointed with the new version and am just happy it's still smells pretty much like the version I fell in love with.

(Edit on 6/11/18: So far, no deepening/strengthening of the juice in the bottle, which honestly has left me pretty disappointed. It’s not that this isn’t a lovely perfume, but it smells more “mass market” to me than the EDT did. I feel like the new guard at Chanel is perhaps sacrificing personality for wider palatability. I had slowly been collecting most of the Exclusifs prior to the EDP reformulation, but have stopped. They’re still well-made, just no longer to my taste...I need to see a bit of off-kilter-ness to really love something.)"

Then the part I like less is more masculine, and the heart reminds me of my grandfather ' s cologne, he was a banker with refined taste, and the smell stays refined, but more clearly masculine..I would swear I smell lavender too...it has also a strong soapy undertone...luxury soap of course...I admire the beauty in Coromandel, but I couldn't pull it off, it isn't what I like to wear, but I really find it vacillates easily and charmingly between feminine and masculine throughout its development..I has also a definite yet classy sexiness...nothing too much out there, just a hint...it isn't easy to wear and it isn't for everybody...

First of all it's not different. At least not to my nose. So there might be slight changes but I don't know it well enough to recognize them. I had the Edt years ago and to me this is the same smell. Again it might be tweaked but I wouldn't know this. Says , going by fragrantica , that the musk aspect is higher here and that there is no vanilla !? And that it's more woody as well that now amber is present. Well amber to my nose was always one of the top notes in coromandel along with patchouli , how was it not listed before ? I don't know. None of that is true in my opinion. I do have samples of the edt as she sent them along with my EDP bottle. I am wearing them side by side. Maybe the EDPis a little more intense and lasts longer. I bet that might be true.

About the fragrance , it's a stunner ! You have to like patchouli in order to love coromandel.
I find it very classy yet it really suits a very cool chick , leather jacket and boots , attitude and all. How is this possible as classy doesn't go hand in hand with a cool chick !? I don't know but it's just how it is. Maybe a classy cool chick. A rich girl that grew up to be a rebbel at heart but leads a high class life but has a rebellous side to her. Maybe a hidden one.


Coromandel reminds me of Calamity J by JHAG , another favourite of mine. Another rebbel perfume. Also reminds me of Patchouli imperiale by Dior. As well as prada Amber and Inez and Vinoodth by Byredo and yes yes i do agree with some of you ,,,ANGEL !!!! Never thought of this before until I read it in quite many reviews. A classy Angel , without the fruits. More refined , wealthier , a little more class. Like someonone mentiones ,,,sisters , one that grew up to be wealthy , married into money and attends charity fundraisers. And then the younger sister Angel who is still nothing but a rebbel , but has a good heart ....

Coromandel is a very well blended , well rounded patchouli amber vanilla fragrance , it smells a little medical , which I quite like. I think of bandaids here and there but in a good way ! Also I think of mint leaves and chocolate , I will add to this review after wearing it for a few days strait.
Stay tuned !"

I sprayed it on a piece of paper less than 5 minutes ago and it's already gone.

It's difficult for me (untrained n00b nose) to pick out the individual components of the fragrance, but I do definitely get citrusy. It's really really nice.

It stays on my dresser now, wouldn't be without it's fabulous, light, summer memories of Detroit, and Germany in 1965. I have the small purse bottle too!

4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","I bought my 100ml splash bottle during a visit to the eponymus flagship store in Cologne while looking for the Farina Cologne Museum - for some reasons I took the former for the latter and was disappointed to see a scentless eau de cologne fountain as the sole attraction!

4711 is the shortest-lived fragrance ever, I think - if it lasts more than 15 minutes on my skin, it's a lucky day - but those 15 minutes are really glorious: a blast of citruses, truly invigorating, mixed with the dark floral sweetness of rose and jasmine, and rounded up with some subtle earthy notes (which I think come from the oakmoss, that even at IFRA concentration, must be über-strong compared to everything else).

Useless as a scent as many intend it today (super projection, everlasting longevity, possibly choking everyone else in the room), the original 4711 is a wonderful fabric scent, or a superb olfactory comfort when you need to smell something nice, clean and invigorating. Strong like also considering its incredibly cheap price. I would love to try some of the flankers in their line and maybe owning one of the 800ml bottle just for the sake of it. If you plan to use it for real, though, do yourself a favour and buy one of the spray bottles - not the splash ones!

Little known fact: Mr Farina and his family were originally from Val Vigezzo, a narrow valley joining the upper tip of Piedmont in Italy to Locarno in Switzerland; there, another local herbalist, Mr Feminis, is said to have invented the first original formulation of a cologne, then called ""aqua mirabilis"", by using locally sourced herbs and flowers, before Farina took it to Cologne and, from there, then across the continent. Val Vigezzo's capital city, Santa Maria Maggiore, hosts a small perfume museum where the story of eau de cologne is explained, and they still sell in the town the original ""Acqua di Colonia - Feminis-Farina"". I bought a 25ml splash bottle and it has a pronounced herbaceous and aromatic (rosemary & lavander) opening mixed with tuned-down citruses, along with a soapy/powdery facet coming up immediately after. It's in a way more masculine and old-fashioned than 4711, but still with similar longevity problems. If you ever happen to be there, it's worth trying - also, the valley is just magnificent."

I’m a bit preemptive to that summer weather as I write this, but I have a feeling of doubt my thoughts on this fragrance will change unfortunately. We shall see... but for the price, I have very low regrets on the purchase and am sure I’ll find a use for it."
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","My ex bf in college wore this. His father was French and lived in France, and he'd visit his dad every summer. I mention this because there is history and nostalgia for me in this scent, but also because French can be snobs about perfume (rightfully so in many cases), and it passed the test in the case of the old bf's family... and this is a German-born scent!

I have the jumbo 27oz bottle for $40 on Amazon. It will last a looong time. But this is a classic and it will be used!

I love the neroli, which stands out nicely, and is softened by everything else, of which nothing else really stands out for me. As others have mentioned, it's not super potent, and, IMO, it has better longevity in the summer than winter. This is a true toilet water, the old school kind, like aftershave splash. I don't consider it the same class of parfum/cologne scents popular today. This comes from another time, another era (early 18th C), when dousing yourself in smell was improper/sacrilege? IDK the history of perfume, but I'd imagine that scents were worn more heavy in the 16th C than in the 17th C when people began to bathe. Anyway, read the wiki article on it, there is an interesting history.

I don't consider 4711 in the same category with my JM Basil Neroli, or my Chloe Eau de Fleurs Neroli, which I consider feminine, nor would I align it with the more masculine TF Neroli Portofino, nor Creed's Neroli Sauvage. Why? The oldest of these scents is from 1994! Hardly a realistic comparison to a 300yo perfume!!! These newer scents are all more potent, more expensive, and more readily relevant for our contemporary use/trends/needs. Most people leave a scent trail once they pass you these days. I don't think that was the intent or reality back in the day. If you sat close at tea you could smell another person, and it would cover any stink, but you know, it was another time. Love 4711 for what it is."
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","Atypical review, as I don't really wear this as a fragrance.
I came upon 4711 a few years ago, looking for something Neroli-Portofino-Esque. TOO MANY people name this as a suitably similar bargain option and I firmly disagree. If that's what you're looking for, I highly suggest getting a dupe fragrance oil instead. There are some really great ones available, with longevity that puts Tom Ford to shame. But I digress.
4711 is a summer staple for me, but I apply it under my arms along with crystal mineral deodorant, or later in the day after I've sweat a bit but am not ready for a shower. The citrus and alcohol content in this is incredible at inhibiting bacterial growth and neutralizing some of that ""hot weather musk"" that may develop with a more natural hygiene routine (read: no chemical deodorizers or antiperspirants). 4711 also has the added benefit of many other pleasant fragrance additions and the overall effect is one of refreshment. It's very sharp and tart for a few seconds and then fades off to a pleasant near-nothingness, so wearing this as a traditional cologne is sort of futile. But under my arms it smells a bit like froot loops for some reason, and that makes me chuckle.

Don't buy this looking to quell the craving for Tom Ford though, and don't buy this if you're looking for something with any kind of longevity. But if you want to splash it under your arms or all over after a shower for a quick wake-up pick-me-up, definitely go for it. I don't plan on ever being without this one."

Pretty straightforward, beautiful yet fleeting. I might have purchased because of the hyped up nostalgia and the beautiful bottle ( and I do agree with the previous reviewer that although cheap,---compared to other fragrances, I could have purchased a better EDC with better performance)

Once my refill bottle is empty, I shall refill it with another better performing cologne (LOL)

Don't get me wrong! this is definitely a classic and a must have for collectors in their archive ( but it isn't a necessity hehe, did I just contradict myself?)

I'll test this on clothes if it lasts longer.


OK UPDATE:(3/30/21) PLEASE DISREGARD MY PREVIOUS, SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE REVIEW.

I am now obsessed with this! I've been wearing this 2 days straight ( probably for the entire week-- the weather in Manila now is scorching) , and the simplicity of this is just uplifting.

When sprayed underneath and on clothes I get slightly longer wear and this delicious airy effect which I look for in colognes. The basic construction of this cologne is where it's beauty lies. It doesn't scream, it is subdued and sultry and just refreshing. It leaves my skin smelling naturally clean. No acidic-pee-like drydown which I get from some concentrated EDCs.

I also spray it on my hands and inhale as indicated on the box and it's a just a simple luxurious treat! I feel more positive and energized and inspired.

Now let me order an 800 ml. I will never be without this forever."

First, yes - it does smell similar to TF Neroli Portofino, no doubt. But the scent is gone in a few minutes. My bottle doesn't have a spray nozzle either, so this is going to be used as a hand sanitizer most likely.

Where I live, this is not as cheap as many of the reviewers say, so I really regret this purchase since I could have gotten a better fragrance for the same price. You live and you learn! I have no nostalgic connections to anyone using 4711 in my family or amongst my friends, so the sentimental value of this is not there for me. Once this bottle is done, I will never buy it again :)"

When I was a little kid I vividly remember a TV ad that aired every summer. The hook-line & theme, 4711: ""It's as Cold as Ice"".

It was deliciously politically incorrect by today's norm.

It featured various over-heated characters exalting the virtues of the brew.

There was a trucker leaning out the window of his truck, dripping in sweat, saying; in reference to the heat: ""When I can't take no more""....then he'd use 4711 'wipes' on his face & neck,

Another was a busty, Benny Hill-esque young woman saying she kept hers (4711 purse spray) in the fridge. She would spray it on her very camera focused decolletage & 'giggle & jiggle' whilst exclaiming: ""ooooooh!"".

I think every kid in the industrial world encounters a bottle on their Mum's dresser. And many an ancestor going way, way back.

I like to splash it on first thing in the morning or on a warm afternoon to freshen up and revive myself.

I’m also a fan of applying to a handkerchief or bandana on sweaty days. The fresh scent is invigorating and restorative for someone like me who sweats profusely and doesn’t care for humidity.

4711 is a citrusy EDC, so don’t use like a men’s cologne and expect a long-lasting fragrance. It’s all about freshening up, and it does the job well and at a good price.

By comparison, I also have a bottle of the Guerlain EDC du Coq, and it’s basically a more linear version of 4711—pure citrus, with even less longevity. So, 4711 holds its own in this specific fragrance genre.

I believe generations of Europeans have been using this stuff to freshen up in the afternoon with a splash or a dab on a handkerchief, and they really know what they’re doing. Anyone interested in fragrances should start here and get a feel for an original—the reason many of us call it “cologne.”"

This EdC isn't for anyone other than you. If you've never put on a fragrance just for yourself, but only so that others can notice you, this might be the moment where you either have a paradigm shift and embrace what 4711 is, or you turn around and dismiss it as ""underperforming junk"".

Many here rightly say this is a great warm weather after shower splash. I on the other hand tend to use it right when I get out of bed: while I'm making coffee/breakfast, starting my work day, everything before my daily workout preceding my shower. It transitions the body from its dormant phase overnight into where you need to be to get things going for the day ahead with a bright hit of well blended citruses. There's approximately 1 billion notes listed here on Fragrantica for 4711 but the top notes are where the game is played because this doesn't last long enough to fancy the heart or base much.

And it not lasting is not a problem because 1) 4711 comes in huge god damn bottles and 2) those bottles are ridiculously inexpensive.

Don't be afraid to pour a couple rounds into your hands and put on your neck, wrists, wherever. It's inexpensive for a reason, because it's meant to be a transition scent. If this were the cost of Dior Homme Cologne (in and of itself a price point international travesty) you'd be well within your rights to not go anywhere near it. But it isn't, and you should.

4711 is a fresh start, or restart, to the day whenever you need to snap out of a fog. It does this job admirably, and because its duties are very intimate and personal, I would recommend getting the splash bottles over the small spray bottle. Make your experience with 4711 tactile, let it run over your hands and apply its refreshment personally wherever you want with them.

Treat 4711 as a daily ritual, much like the winding of a handwound movement in a watch. You'll be the better for it."

It evaporates pretty quickly so it's not a day-long disaster if you put on too much by accident (which I've done with other perfume before, ackk!).

Its Good, refreshing, light summer scent but does not give a premium vibe like TOM FORD NEROLI PORTOFINO. Its more like Ferrari Bright Neroli
Its very affordable low cost cologne but what i dont like about this Fragrance is its Silage and longevity. Its a close to skin scent with only a longevity of maximum 25 Min as it vanishes from your skin or clothes after that.

Based on this down point, I would rate it 5.5/10"
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","Refreshing, bright, and summery. I like this post-shower especially after a workout in the warmer months. No longevity beyond the first half hour. I have taken to layering it with Escentric Molecule 01 (use your ISO E Super of choice) which extends the longevity a little. Already have an extra big bottle. At least it's cheap and well made. A true classic cologne."
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","My favourite after shower cologne during the summer months. It’s incredibly fleeting but so refreshing! It’s also very inexpensive, so treat yourself this summer, spray away and enjoy it!
Highly recommended!"
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","This is absolutely gorgeous but so ephemeral and fleeting I don’t know if I would repurchase. I ended up using this as a linen spray (I have the 3oz spray version). It’s quite similar to Florida water. The white florals are bright and fresh but there is a very alcoholic blast at first. I like it for what it Is, but am also longing for it to do more. If you want a longer lasting bright white floral, I recommend Fragonard Fleur d’Oranger."
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","4711 is a weird one and I like originals. I can see why some think it reminds them of bag spray cause that contain citronella compounds as well.
To me it gives a good feeling, there are other smell that should be bad odour but I love: Bacuri butter, tea tree. Maybe it's heartiness or their good properties. An articule in fragrantica suggested that maybe we'll get a bleach-kind of scent next, because its association with cleanliness and we used it more lately, that we end up liking it!

On me it's a very fresh oakmoss. Citruses never project off of my skin so it's mostly oakmoss, basil, vetiver and the jasmine makes it more unisex. It doesn't really go either masculine or feminine to me, it's just clean and fresh. When I smell it I get the image of someone in an old fashioned bathroom applying this after a long steamy bath! Lovely."
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","I've been wearing this the past couple of days, trying to get my head around how I feel about it. It certainly has a lot of fans. Expectation can be a dangerous thing and following a lot of reviews I was expecting something fresh and at least a little citrusy. Unfortunately all I'm getting is a typical aftershave woodsy aromatic sent. As so many people mentioned neroli I looked this up and yes, that could be what I'm getting. It's meant to be a fresh spicy fragrance but I'd say it's more warm spicy. Barbershop scent? Yes. Longetivity and sillage are poor but that is balanced out by the very affordable price. All in all, despite everything, I really quite like it."
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","This is what the Rhineland smells like in my memory... My partner was spending their mornings and afternoons going over videos for a biennial with a bunch of other curators and I was trying to lift a post-graduate school depression by hiking up the drachenfels, poking through churches and kunsthalles and drinking way too much beer... This scent, all bright citrus kick and alcoholic spice backlit that beautiful trip - a little ass-kicker of a fragrance, cheeky and invigorating but still utterly classic! I'd douse myself in the stuff before heading out for the day, keeping a package of the tissues in my purse for a mid-train ""refresh"" between cities and towns.... Aachen, Bonn, Düsseldorf, Oberdollendorf... or a hike into the mountains to track down that winery or this beer hall that was only reachable on foot..."
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","In July of 2018 we had one of the worst heat waves to hit that year. Our AC blew out late in the evening and temperatures were still over the 100s. While my significant other ran on an emergency trip to home depot to replace it, I stayed behind trying to stay cool. In the middle of trying to meditate myself into a popsicle four numbers came to my mind, 4711. That night I put my bottle in the freezer and every five minutes I would spritz myself. I keep a bottle in my fridge ever since.

This is definitely the most refreshing scent in my collection. This reminds me of a cold glass of lemon water. It is zesty and watery, it’s not sharp or sweet making it soothing. Longevity is pretty nonexistent making it easy to use throughout the day to freshen up. There is a beauty to it when it’s been on the skin for few minutes.

A decant of this goes with me everywhere."

I was given a couple of bottles by my grandmother when I was about 10. One was the round traditional older bottle and one the newer flask version. I remember her telling me that she wore it when she had a headache. I guess it was a detox from her Blue Grass. I still have those bottles.

I think of Eau de Cologne as the gin of scent, something you use when you need to perk yourself up. Such a super refreshing unisex scent, super cheap too."

4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","I'm sorry to read so many negative reviews on this one. Yes, of course the formulation has changed a little over the last 200+ years, but what hasn't? I think one needs to understand the history of cologne to really appreciate that this is one of the originals, not a perfume, and certtainly not ""newbie garbage""!
The formulation itself was medicinal, herbs and citrus, and follows closely its medieval predecessors. Though its own not-unromantic origins are in the French-occupied German city of Cologne in the late-eighteenth century, it was perhaps the first widely-circulated name-brand of its kind. The popularity of the formulation is attested in that so many contemporaries boasted similar ingredients. One example is Geurlain's Eau Impériale, fabled to have been mixed for Empress Eugénie to treat her migraine.
No longer meant for ingestion, 4711 is fresh and alcoholic, dissipating quickly after giving its effect, similar to that of modern aftershaves. It can be used to cool perspiring skin, say, after a workout, as a bracer after a shave - both men and women - , as a spray to refresh a room, linen, clothing, etc., or as a very effective astringent."
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","Despite its respectiful history, today 4711 original smells like the products used to clean the floor or the windows. I tried it several times, but unfortunatelly this impression repeated every time. Overall, ignoring that association that might not correspond to the majority of users, 4711 original presents a sour smell, citric, fresh and watery, that wouldn't be appropriated for winter or colder nights. Moreover, it is linear along the time, for those that liked it from the beggining, won't have any bad surprise later."

And what a glorious note it is. Secondly, for an EDC, I'm getting surprising longevity as a skin scent compared to some other 4711 offerings.

There is a reason this has been around for centuries. It's a straight up masterpiece! Sure, it would be cool to have it in a stronger formula, but maybe that's kind of the allure--its fleeting nature makes it that much more precious.

So, spray lavishly. Mr. Muelhens has given us a timeless gift!"

4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","Growing up in Austria and Germany in the 1980s, I remember these bottles of 4711 Kölnisch Wasser (that's German for Eau de Cologne - or rather, Eau de Cologne is French for Kölnisch Wasser, he he) being EVERYWHERE.
Whenever you stepped into someone's - anyone's - bathroom, there would be one of these. The miniatures were popular gifts for children, especially from elderly relatives, and I had quite a few of them.

Back then I thought the 4711 Original Eau de Cologne to be slightly sour and bitter. It is not strong, so I did not much mind it, but I was not a fan.

This has certainly changed! I am super-impressed by this light-weight now. I get a delicious blend of citrus fruit, a tinge of flowers (the roses, I think), and a bit of backbone - probably the vetiver. It is extremely refreshing and well-blended.

Poor longevity and sillage, but then it is not an Eau de Parfum, but a Kölnisch Wasser ;-)"

I'm not qualified to make medical claims, but it's probably an extra step against germs and viruses, and more importantly, it's a soothing olfactory cap to what has become the slightly stressful process of sanitizing oneself after coming home. 4711 is the original Tom Ford Neroli Portofino - a close relative of most modern fresh, aromatic-citrusy fragrances. It's a gorgeous, uplifting classic. The potential disinfecting properties of the eau de cologne are really just a bonus."

4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","This is an aftershave, not something to place high expectations on for longevity. After a shave, splash it on, enjoy the shot of freshness and have your TRUE scent ready to go for the remainder of the day. Again, use as an aftershave and top it with a fresh summer or spring oriented cologne. This will not have a huge impact on what you choose to wear, but I would avoid mixing it with something expensive or not in line with a citrus fresh orientation. This is a good inexpensive mood lift, but I do agree our body chemistry can influence a direction a fragrance will take, as this lacks projection it could easily swing badly for some. Enjoy the inexpensive price, use as intended, appreciate the old world charm it represents."
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","One of the things I love about perfume is that inexpensive purchases can be just as cheering (if not more so) than expensive ones. While I love many high end fragrances, a perfume need not be expensive to be high quality and beautiful. 4711 Original Eau de Cologne is often recommended not only as a must try classic cologne, but is also one of the very best inexpensive fragrances.

I prefer to spray rather than splash so I ordered a 90 ml bottle and was delighted to discover that it is refillable. This is a classic citrus cologne, indeed it is literally the original eau de cologne, at this time just shy of being in production for 230 years. There is a medley of citrus fruits in the top notes, followed by fresh (but not overly feminine) flowers, on a base of woods and mosses with touch of musk. I agree with other reviewers that there is pleasant medicinal quality to it. Using it gives me the same healthful feeling as washing my hands when they are visibly dirty.

This has almost no sillage and lasts less than an hour but I'm more than okay with that, I love it. You wear this for yourself, and not for others. I'll be carrying this with me into spring and certainly all summer, spraying with abandon to refresh myself in a hot, humid city. Throw a bottle of this into your handbag and cheerfully get on with your life."
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","Some of the criticism of 4711 has me laughing. Sure, the longevity and projection is very weak and grannies may like it. This isn't a cologne for others to smell on you; it's a splasher, a cool boost for the face whether it be on a hot day or after shaving. It has that slightly medicinal vibe that is just so fresh and feels like it's doing you good. Lush! If you want it to last longer, decant some into an atomiser and spray. It settles down a little more slowly and remains as a skin scent for a couple of hours."
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","This is lovely. I have so many good memories of this. We always had this in the house when I was growing up (I'm 20 btw) and I recently gifted another bottle to my mum for Christmas. It sort of surprises me how many notes are listed because to me this is not an overly complicated scent. It's very citrusy but I don't find it sour or sharp it has some sort of a green quality to it which I think is most prominently basil (without any bitterness). Such a lovely refreshing summer scent that mellows out into a fresh woodsy yet still citrusy fragrance. I wish it lasted longer as it disappears rather quickly. It's not a complete sin as the price tag is rather reasonable.

Reminds me of trips to the zoo in the heat (minus the animal smells) when I was little or playing at the playground in the heat of the Budapest summer."

4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","It is citrusy and sharp at first but a short time later there's a creamy sweetness that develops. It's one of the best fresh, green scents I've tried. It's a skin scent, not much projection and it really is gone in a couple hours, but it's so inexpensive you just apply it liberally as often as you want. Buy the 800ml bottle and go beast-mode on it! It's about the cost of a 100ml bottle of most other fragrances. Perfect summer fragrance."

I love the fact that it is still commercially active and available at almost every decent perfume store.
Vintage looking bottle adds some interior design points to the bathroom and I love spraying it all around me after work to lift off the stresses of the day and get ready and recharged for the evening.

The new TF Metallique reminds me of it somehow.."

4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']",I was interested in 4711 as it was often referred to as a dupe for TF neroli portofino. I blind bought because of all the positive reviews and its cheap price. Now I know I am a fan of neither. Scent wasn't too pleasant for me. Reminds me of some medicines and it was too old fashioned for my liking. I especially dislike the powdery scent that's left once all the citrus scent evaporates in its first 5 minutes. The longevity is on a whole new level. Few sprays will last less than 30 minutes (at most). Just to experiment I washed my hands with it and it didn't last any longer. It only left ickiness on my hands like after using a hand-sanitiszer. Regret buying HUGE bottle even with its cheap price. I guess it will be sitting in my display cupboard for a decorative purpose.
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","Think.......what other fragrances can be had in 800 mls? The bottle shape and labelling together make this worth buying. This is one for the moment of application not for longevity. As the packaging states, use generously, breathe in, breathe out and relax. That said, it has been around since 1792 so must have found sustained favour over those passing years. On me it lasts a little less well than another classic EDC; Acqua di Selva by Visconti di Modrone. If you want the freshness to repeat then fill a pocket atomiser and use regularly throughout the day. One final comment on longevity: there are many EDT's and EDP's out there nowadays which also disappear almost before the bottle is re-corked. The difference with 4711 is that it has and will continue to endure because it smells so damn good!"
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","Anyone serious about fragrance should keep a bottle, as a reference, as a detox diet even.

Really a honest thing from another time… bergamot… lemon… lily… jasmine… cedar... go for a big bottle as this is to be splashed allover. It’s not about lasting, it is about resetting. Happiness of the moment, always gone and just enjoyed in the present without much thought and certainly no judgement. Something so simple, when time is right, is a luxury."

I've not smelled 4711 for a very long time. I remember seeing it on my nana's bedroom dressing table many many years back.

I understand that 4711 is an EDC and that it is, and is supposed to be, fresh and refreshing. And as an EDC is not expected to have longevity.

What I'm curious about (and I'm no expert here) is the fact that it has oakmoss, patch, cedar, vetiver etc listed in the base notes, so I'm wondering why it doesn't have better longevity than it does? After reading some of the reviews, I was quite surprised to see those notes listed at all. I haven't read any reviews referencing any notes particularly other than the citrus."

Well for my family it’s this thing.. Lol. So my wounds always smell of 4711.. I suppose they did for the alcohol content and even though I fully realize how ridiculous this is, it’s comforting to do!

The only issue is the longevity is not good. But that should be expected for a splash cologne. Although the scent only lasts 30 minutes.

Yes this does not last at all but that's reflected in the price. In Germany I believe this is not traditionally used as a perfume but to feel fresh. They sell this in wipes, soap, shower gel and deodorant. If you're looking for a citrusy soap then definitely worth buying some of it in soap format I have had compliments on my soap. I have an 800ml bottle which I decant into a little atomiser. In my line of work I am in an enclosed space where sometimes we may get people that have a terrible lingering odor I spray this then as a kind of air freshener to mask the odor. You may ask why not just use air freshener? Well this smells better than any air freshener you can buy, it's inoffensive and it will linger around long enough for the bad odor to pass."

While my tastes have grown over the years, I still think this is such a fun one to have and hold. And yes, I do think the Tom Ford NP is very similar.

It wasn’t until I got here that I realized that 65 of you feel the same way. Of course I’m talking about Ferrari Bright Neroli. Here’s the thing, I hate Ferrari Bright Neroli. To my nose it’s has a citrus moth ball type of thing going on that just repulses me. However, that being said I love 4711, so they are not the exact same, but FBN goes in a different direction that just disturbs my nose, where as 4711 is a better refined version, but a hell of a lot weaker. To those wondering how to make this stuff last longer, it’s not for the skin, it’s for the clothes, at least that’s my trick. If you want to take a risk Ferrari Bright Neroli lasts a hell of a lot longer than 4711, but to me just doesn’t smell as good. I wish there was a product that could increase weak scents. I have molecule 1 and even tried that, but in my experience the whole layering scents with Molecule 01 is a myth. Besides on my skin Molecule 01 is too woody, I have a version where it’s turned up to almost an EDP. Anyway, if you’re looking for a way to extend, be generous on you shirt while spraying and you should get a 6-8 hour scent that lasts for a work day. Cheers fellas..."

A hot weather essential.i buy the largest bottle and decant into 1 or 2 ounce glass sprays for portability. And for keeping in the refrigerator. As others have noted this is not, on its own, a traditional “perfume”. Sometimes you want a lift for yourself ,without sharing it wth the world.
I will add a few drops of peppermint oil or neroli oil to the smaller sprays. This is very zingy!
This is a multipurpose fragrance; after shave, after shower splash, dab on temples for headaches and lightly scenting the interior of handbags.
This lasts longer when applied to moisturized skin."

However this is a great and extremely cheap cologne that I really enjoy using as a traditional aftershave after a good shave. Splashing some on after a shower during the summer would also be perfect for that extra bit of refreshment. What I love most is that because it doesn’t last long by the time you are ready to leave the house if you decide to wear another fragrance this will most likely not clash with anything as it’s closer to wearing off by then. I plan on replacing my bottle as soon as my current empties.

Because of this it’s good for working out and spraying like a body spray when getting out of the shower, laying around the house, or before going to bed. It’s unique for sure. Don’t know how true it is but I heard it was John F. Kennedy’s favorite cologne."

Everybody seems to think that it lasts five minutes and has no dry down, but this is absolutely untrue. It dries down beautifully. My grandmother had only one perfume, and it was this one.

No its not a perfume..what it gives you is a blast of refreshment on a hot summers day and its now a family must have x
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","I grew up with 4711, and frankly it's hard to think of it as a fragrance. It's more of a staple than a perfume in many German households, used to refresh and clean one's hands and neck in hot and sweaty situations. I've a particular fondness for the icy roller ball and sponge tip applicators and scented tissues, they were delicious to use. Instant heat relief! Also great to cool down mosquito bites!

The scent of 4711 is iconic, fresh and sharp, nearly pure alcohol and a tiny bit of fragrance. I love it!

There are a number of flankers available, none of which I'm familiar with. It would be interesting to try out some of them, but I'm on a budget. :(

It's worth to make a blind buy for the original 4711 and keep it around for the summer heat. Keep cool with Koelnisch Wasser!"
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","Unlike most here, this doesn't bring back memories of the days of yore - my relatives were never really into fragrances, and being on the opposite side of the world from Germany, we never really had 4711's products sold here.

However, I managed to get my hands on a bottle this week. I was expecting a spray bottle, so imagine my surprise when I realised it was a splash! I've never used one of these before, so it was new to me.

The surprise, nevertheless, was actually the smell. I didn't really pick up any citrus or neroli notes on the first whiff, actually; the moment I smelled it, I instantly recognised it as the scent of the antibacterial soaps and hand cleansers used in public hospitals here! I must say, I'm pretty surprised that I had been using 4711 every time I visited warded relatives!

It took a few more tries to slowly differentiate the different notes - what hit me immediately was distinct notes of bergamot and petitgrain, which I noticed smelled drier upon application to the skin than when in the bottle. The drydown is a clean, sweet, pleasant floral scent reminiscent of neroli, which doesn't stay for long - about an hour - but at its price, I'd say this cologne is absolutely worth it! It's also good as a refresher to perk me up during dreary work-days, as many have mentioned here, and its short life helps it to fit this role perfectly."

4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","No scale on Fragrantica to put on this one. Longevity is 5 minutes and absolutely no projection, oh well maybe like 5 mins as well. Good cologne you can use right after the evening shower to refresh and at the same time calm yourself. Using as a day scent is completly pointless, because it just doesn't smell at all. I got 90 ml bottle for like $5 or less, just to check it's vintage roots. It's more for collecting purposes than for everyday use. I believe that these 42 people who chceked enormous sillage and 17 ones who put ""very long lasting"" are spraying 4711 every 4 and a half minute, haha!"

I think a lot of people mistake it for a fragrance that is going to stay on their skin for hours, but more so it's supposed to be medicinal - to have medicinal properties for the mind and spirit. On the box it tells you to splash some on palms, rub together, breathe in, breathe out, and relax. And it is relaxing, as well as invigorating. It's a beautiful, calming, citrusy, herb garden in summer. It's fresh and re-energizing. If you're feeling tired or stressed in any way it really does help. It's like opening a window to your inner being to let some fresh air and sunshine in. Just lovely.

Edit: I also find layering it with Green Tea by Elizabeth Arden works nicely. The scents hold enough similarity to compliment, mix, and sit well with one another."

I don't have a ""nose,"" but even I can tell this is citrusy and bergomatty. It's as refreshing as Jean Nate, but maybe a bit more sophisticated. It has been around for hundreds of years, too."

A display of this cologne was featured, and I remembered reading about it a while back on Fragrantica.com. What better place to try it and purchase it than Cologne!

It's actually a fantastic summer cologne for men. Not too feminine to my nose but light and very citrusy and bright.

I've been using it like an aftershave (and it lasts about that long).

Given that the formula was created 226 years ago, it has amazing staying power (though very poor sillage)."
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","Super interesting to read all the reviews here treating this as a full fledged fragrance.

Yeah, it is, true enough, yet in Germany hardly anyone really treats it that way... at least judging from people I know.

I got introduced to this as a child by my late aunt Mary, who used it all her life mainly to freshen up during long train journeys, which is why we always had a bunch of travel size bottles to toss in our purses.

If you were stuck with insufferably sweaty people in a stuffy train compartment you'd dash some on your handkerchief and sniff that. If you really had a long journey without a real chance to wash you'd at least retreat to the wash room briefly, splash it on your neck and wipe some around your arms.

(Mostly older) people who really like it might use it after shaving or their morning wash up too for that extra boost. But I don't think anyone would really expect it to last throughout the day. It's just supposed to give you a feeling of freshness.

As a German I grew up with it and really rather know it as a universal affordable on the go way to freshen up or brave smelly situations during travels. And that purpose it serves very well since generations.

I'd never be able to discuss notes in this though. It's an established Eau de Cologne since generations and when I smell it I just know it's 4711 unmistakably. It's fresh, initially quite sharp, but turning to just a 'clean' smell quickly.

Classic blend, glad that still many people seem to be enjoying it."

It's fresh and sweet (just a little) a bit like a citric candy. Probably a bit better for me in a spray bottle than a splash, but I'll take any form of this I can get.

Not to be worn as a fragrance, per se, but more to be used during the moments too hot to wear fragrance."
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","Quite possibly one of the best smelling concoctions ever invented.

Many others below, have described the fascinating history behind it, as well as in depth analysis of the fragrance and much better than I can ever do, so I will stick to a few basic facts.

Strong Neroli and citric notes. The basil is there, but never dominant. Aside from these three, the other notes will demand serious concentration to discern and are as I see it, complimentary notes which are there to balance out the composition.

I use the shower gel daily, but as a fragrance its useless unless you fancy respraying yourself every hour.

Go for Ferrari Bright Neroli instead. Essentially the same smell that has slightly enhanced citrus, comes with better longevity and is equally cheap."

4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","This is the same formula as the first eau de cologne ever produced, back in 1792 in the city of Cologne, Germany. It is one of the oldest perfumes still in production continously. It is theorized that the emporer Napolean Bonaparte would use an entire bottle of this every day. All modern colognes are based on this blend, particularly so with Tom Ford's Neroli Portofino which is basically a copy of this with added strength. The opening is very soapy and smells a lot like neroli (orange blossom), but I also detect strong notes of lemon and lime. The notes smell very natural as well, and not synthetic at all. On drydown it smells mainly of soapy neroli; it is extremely pleasant. The fragrance does not lean masculine or feminine - and I actually bought a bottle of this for my mom as well. The sillage is weak leaning moderate while the longevity is also very weak (lasts about 1-2 hours max), however - but this was the case with traditional eau de colognes which were meant to freshen up and not as long-lasting perfumes. I bought a large 200 ml splash bottle of this and simply decant it in a travel atomizer that I carry with me, which I spray before I'm meeting people at times. For this purpose, it works very well indeed. Overall I absolutely love the scent of this although the sillage and longevity are fleeting - though there have been alternatives made in this neroli-citrus style like Mugler Cologne, Ferrari's Bright Neroli, Bond No. 9 Eau de New York, Acqua di Parma Colonia Essenza, and Tom Ford Neroli Portofino Forte. Being a neroli fanatic, I own most of these already but still appreciate 4711 EDC. It is one of two 'historical' colognes I have, the other being Pinaud's virgin island bay rum.

I even carry it in my purse in a little spray bottle for hot weather and flashes. ;) The massive 27oz/798ml bottles are wonderful and last forever.

My BF gave me my current gigantic bottle - he chose it because he loves wearing it, too!

On the box it writes: EST. 1792, 86 VOL. ...More than just a fragrance! The unique composition of 4711 Original eau de cologne has a positive effect on body, mind and soul and has been appreciated across the globe since 1792. To experience the superior quality for yourself: splash 4711 generously onto the hands, rub together, BREATHE IN, BREATHE OUT and relax.

I have to spray it once every 3 minutes and repeat it 3 times on the same spot to find the scent exist, but for 10 minutes. (The truth is it's still there but difficult to recognise.) It's like an air-pleasing than cologne. Maybe after-shower usage, best for office purpose, it won't offend anyone anything including the perfume you actually wear, just spray as much as you are please. It's cheap, classic and refreshing. I even use it as a dry hand wash (after the breathe in breathe out pratice;)

4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","Well, I've found yet another splash to shamelessly horde and keep in every one of my bags. I don't have much to add to the choir singing 4711 praises, so forgive me for reiterating what's already been said.

Neroli Portofino's perky, herbal zest and neroli were blatantly cloned from 4711, the reviews aren't kidding. I haven't worn NP but have tested it countless times at the mall, always disheartened by its crazy price tag. So imagine how I felt when I learned a cheap as chips, 200-year-old eau de cologne supposedly smelled just like it. I went ahead and sprang for a small bottle without a second thought.

I wasn't disappointed. This is an anti-depressant/aspirin in olfactory form. 4711 is honestly the most beautiful citrus I've ever smelled, and citrus tends not to impress me. When I whiffed my bottle, I knew I had smelled this before. Its fingerprints are on every moist towlette, after shave, and citrus soap ever produced. It is, at once, soothing and energizing. Its age is a testimony to its timelessness--how have I not heard of 4711 before?

The lemon is prominent, but I believe it mainly acts as a supporting note to orange rind and herbaceous basil. When you smell 4711, you get a blast of photo-realistic citruses and green, bitter leaves. This is the majority of the fragrance. I get vague fruity florals in the background, but they're barely there. I mostly detect melon and watery lily. Reading the history of 4711, I learned that it was originally dubbed a 'miracle water' by a monk who produced it. While grandiose, it's an apt sentiment. 4711 smells like a child's concept of a cure-all, or holy water.

Staying power is dismal, as others have said. I find myself constantly splashing my small bottle to try and keep the fragrance to no avail. It's gone within an hour, probably less. I can't fault it for this reason, though. It's available in a very affordable and huge bottle, which I plan on purchasing. Ahhh... if only my sweat smelled like this."

Of course 4711 is a lot older than JVAB. But that wasn't the point. I don't always try fragrances in the order in which they were created, do you? So if you tried Varvatos first and then 4711, would 4711 not remind you of Varvatos?

I have a humble suggestion for you. Rather than seeking out fault and disagreement, why not try taking yourself a little less seriously? Show some well deserved kindness and gratitude to all the folks who make this site a true community. I think it's a safe bet that Fragrantica has given more to you than vice-versa."
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","Call me crazy, but something about this is very similar to John Varvatos Artisan Blu. Both share an almost ""Coppertone"" suntan lotion vibe, which to my nose is very pleasant and evocative of summer. And IMHO, both easily qualify as unisex, given their lightness and summery feel. At first sniff, I think the JV packs a bit more depth and citrus brightness. After a few minutes, 4711 really opens up into fresh orange zest, only to evolve back to its sunscreen-like vibe. Strange evolution, but not bad in any way while it lasts -- which is not long.

For the money, I think 4711 is a really nice pick-me-up type scent for those dog days of summer. Don't judge it for its sillage or longevity -- that's not what scents like this are about. It's all about the cooldown, and in that regard, I think this stuff shines. By definition it's nothing new or unique - and that is perfectly ok too.

There is a reason why 4711 has been around as long as it has. It's cheap, nice and refreshing for male and female, young and young-at-heart alike. And according to popular lore, JFK used it - how's that for the ""interesting"" factor? Just buy it already!"

For such a beautifully packaged product, they're affordable and come in many sizes. As is with most EDCs their longevity and sillage aren't very impressive. I recommend buying the other lines of 4711 instead of the original, but you might wanna get this one for novelty."
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","I was really eager to try this fragrance because of the supposed resemblance with Tom Ford Neroli Portofino which is one of my favorite summer scents, but too expensive regarding longevity... I bought 4711 in a box with a 200 ml bottle plus shower gel for 14 euros.
The first spray is so lemony and so fresh you would like to bath in it! Then after a few minutes you really can't tell the difference with Neroli Portofino: the freshest neroli ever!
However, on my skin, 4711 never evolves and disappears within an hour, whereas Portofino becomes sweeter and ambery and lingers as a skin scent for hours.
So 4711 is really beautiful and I'll use it lavishly next summer to refresh but it does not compare with Neroli Portofino in terms of complexity and pleasure!"

4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","4711 is the best example of a true Eaux de Cologne. It's intent is to brighten one's day when the sun is blazing down on them and making them feel overheated and lethargic... a pick me up. Although shortlived, as all true eau de colognes should be, the candied citruses and soft white flowers are incredibly refreshing while they last. The notes say there's mosses and I take issue with that slightly, as traditional EDC fragrances don't usually contain such ingredients. Usually just top and middle notes, skipping the base. In any case, it's a true beauty. Comparable to Neroli Port. (was it a loving homage or a complete rip off?) and Cologne of Love by Couvents.

As it stands this is a true masterpiece, being passed through centuries from generation to generation. I like to just put a little in my hands, rub it together and just sniff away until its gone (usually 30-40 minutes, which is really quite good)
In regards to spending money on Eau de Colognes, I'd like them to be either cheap and fantastic (this) or superbly high quality and enjoyable to the very end (Guerlain's Eau de Cologne offerings and Chanel's)
10/10, really. Can't fault it. More aromatherapy than fragrance, but w/e"

#1) Upon first ""sniff"", I immediately knew and felt WHY this classic has been in production since the late 1700s.
TOTALLY unisex, the composition is literally herbal, citrusy-slightly floral effing PERFECTION.
Zero lasting power, as it's not a perfume proper but rather a cologne, and as such, it is perfect.

I'm in 100% agreement with ladylva: 4711 is brilliant to use immediately after a shower while you're in your dressing robe applying lotions and cosmetics before getting dressed. The fresh, zesty sheer fragrance is a crisp, but very pleasant, waker-upper.

By the time you're ready for your day scent, this refreshing classic will either be a skin scent or disappear completely. But I think that's brilliant and precisely the function of a cologne.
The scent is refreshing, herbal, citrus without being sharp, and herbaceously floral. This is a beautiful juice!"

4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","I realize Neroli isn't listed, but orange is, and what I get from this classic cologne water is:

Neroli, vetiver, citrus!

It's strong, unisex, and timeless. It's also very short lived, but I don't think of this as a drawback. In some ways short longevity is a quality of 4711, because I cannot imagine wanting to smell this way ALL day. The brief, potent experience is enough, which is my personal commentary, not criticism!

Naturally 4711 can be used in just the same way as Florida Water, for instance, and is a great childhood memory for many people. Before hand sani these were even used to sanitize, which I think is a superior, fragrant solution to germ killing... if not as portable. ;)"

4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","How to make your wardrobe less pretentious:

1. Spend a few dollars on a bottle of 4711;
2. Enjoy!

Inexpensive as it may be, there's a reason 4711 is still going strong - it's a timeless classic. Drugstore cheapies may come and go with the passing of each generation, but 4711 will outlive them all.

In essence, 4711 is the Eau de Cologne par excellence - citrus, florals and herbs in a concentration that begs to be splashed, sprayed and reapplied with abandon. Lemon, bergamot, basil and jasmine swirl into an olfactory illusion of neroli.

The closest cousin to 4711 is Guerlain's Eau de Cologne Imperiale, composed some seven decades later, and favoured by the French aristocracy. The differences are subtle; 4711 is lighter and more floral, while Imperiale is richer and more herbal, thanks to good doses of rosemary and verbena. Performance is roughly comparable, although 4711 has much more modest sillage. Still, it's perceptible as a skin scent more than a couple of hours in.

Those complaining about 4711's longevity need to cultivate a better understanding of the history and usage of Eaux de Cologne. To the enlightened, 4711 is perfect for its intended uses: as a pick-me-up in the heat; a quick refresher; a splash after a bath or shave; a source of relief and distraction from headaches and other pains. The list goes on.

A good Eau de Cologne is all about living in the moment, and embracing the peculiar exuberance that only a splash of bright citrus can bring. In that regard, 4711 is a very good cologne indeed."

Its totally different... in the summer.
I love it.. weathert is humid.. sunny.. and this scent just open up in warm months.

Actually, my great aunt, of Swiss-German descent, may have had this stashed away somewhere in her old tudour manse in LA... it smells very Californian to me. Lemons, orange oil, a touch of sun tan lotion (no coconuts) and classic 1960's-70's cheap complementary hotel soap (take that Imaginary Authours/Maison Margiela!) with basil and a touch of old man oakmoss.

4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","I'll be spraying the frig out of this classic this summer (I have the spray format). 4711 is the quintessential definition of cologne.

Bergamot extraordinaire! I first encountered this in my parents' dresser when I was a child. I can't remember if it belonged to my mother or father -- splash bottle, rough paper label. I would sneak a whiff every now and again. That might have been when I was four, 1978.

Fast forward to my first trip on an aeroplane with my parents when I was 11, 1985, I was handed a warm terry towel by an air hostess, infused with something that smelled exactly like this scent. Refreshment for passengers waking up from a long international flight.

Back then too, hotels and restaurants would give you scented cloth towels to refresh you during meals in between courses. 4711 smells of old-school hospitality to me.

I won't bother to dissect this scent and give you a note analysis. Even with poor longevity and projection, at under $20 a bottle for practically any size or format (splash or spray), you can't afford to have this classic staple not have a place in your wardrobe."

4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","4711 is nice summery light fragrance starting with neroli or something that makes me imaging it. After the initial burst of notes I do get something dry, vetiver/oakmoss perhaps with the neroli and some sweetness. Though the sweetness sadly disappears quite rapidly it still has some of it left with flowery undertone along vetiver/oakmoss and neroli. It’s nice scent, but rather common one.

The sillage is bit poor and longevity might be even poorer, but the scent is nice and I’d like to wear it more, but constant reapplying isn’t what I’m willing to do. Decent priced Edp of this would be nice (if it would solve the longevity), though the concept might be bit weird but I just like the scent and miss the longevity. As it is I have fun summer day with it every now and then. If one is willing to reapply it when the fragrance starts to wane it would be borderline great fragrance, sure it’s rather common and people might recognise it but for its price and scent I think it just is great."

4. Had a gross encounter, want to wash it off, so splash some on your hands/cheeks.

5. Want to dedicate an activity or a moment as special, or worthy of quality attention, rather than the whole day.

6. Giving a complaining child a ritual to make themselves feel good, without making them smell perfumy (the kid wants a sensory experience, or to put on perfume just like you, or feels bad and wants some unusual, interesting expression of care)

4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","I deliberately chose this fragrance as my first review as it is close to my heart. I became a perfume lover early in life, and a few have stuck with me. 4711 Original is one. Yes, it's a cheap drugstore cologne, but that is part of its charm. I loved it in the 1970s and saved a bit from my last bottle, so I could remember my beloved scent. It eventually dried up, but I never forgot it. I could not find it again until the advent of the internet which allowed me to renew my passion.

It is not meant to dab on the wrist and behind the ears; it is not meant to spray into the air and walk through the mist. No, this is made to splash on joyfully, to pour handfuls and rub on your body. One who lives in a hot climate will appreciate it, as it will cool you, leaving you refreshed and smelling clean, then disappear, leaving you fresh without interfering with a scent you wish to wear later.

As a kid, this is what blue-green smelled like to me. Coconut sunscreen smelled like the burning sun, and 4711 smelled like a shimmering blue pool.

It's a bright, citrusy scent, lemon and lime to start, with a touch of sandalwood and certainly a light cedar or pine-something masculine. The dry down has a very clean lemony fruit with a very faint floral and woods. This smells like a complicated and simple scent at the same time. It's refreshing, like a child after swimming or clothes hanging on a line on a hot summer day, or perhaps a very handsome man fresh out of the shower shaving. Perhaps that's why it has lasted through generations. It will always be one of those evocative scents to me, reminding me of pools and cleanliness and cooling off on a day of stifling heat. Perhaps this is one of the first I ever tried, I can no longer remember but it is a part of me.

For those who find old opened bottles in charity shops/thrift stores, I do not think you get the same scent. It is alcoholy (although it doesn't smell like alcohol) and the evaporation seems to change the smell, at least it did in my savored bottle, just enough to wonder if I really still loved it. (I do) This is a very cheap cologne belying the quality, and an investment that will not break most banks. A lovely starter scent for a teen, of both sexes."

Edit: I see now why these are so different on me. 4711 has patchouli in it. NP does not. I have to be very careful with patchouli; it usually either becomes shrill and screechy on me, or it turns and makes me smell like a dirty hippie covered in grass stains. What a difference one note makes!"

4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","I'm a huge fan of Guerlain Eau de Cologne Impériale so I was very interest to see how this compared. I'd say it's definitely close but I still like the Guerlain better. The main differences I notice is that overall, 4711 is a little brighter and more floral, and starts off a little more medicinal. Impériale is more creamy and powdery with more lavender. Both are very light and short lived, so unless you're reapplying every 2-4 hours, it's just a fun luxury, feels refreshing while getting ready in the morning but don't expect many other people to notice. One thing I wish I had done was get a spray bottle rather than the flacon. It's hard for me to apply without dripping all over."
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","My grandmother wore this as did my mother and now I am the third generation to adorn myself with this bright and cheery scent. Fresh, clean and crisp, like a smile in a bottle but like a smile it's there and then it's gone.I associate it with so many good memories...."
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","I bought this because of the history behind it, and the fact that I love unisex citrus scents so I had a good feeling about this one. It's kind of funny so many reviewers here think this is only for men, because they advertised it to women quite aggressively in the mid-80s.

It's a very clean, fresh and refreshing scent. I love it. I don't wear it much right now though, it's amazing in spring and summer but a bit out of place in winter.

Interestingly enough, there is a Johnsons baby cologne called Heaven which is a nearly precise replica of this. It's very cheap, about $3.00 at any ethnic grocery store and it wears with 4711 wonderfully because it is an all over body splash as opposed to a cologne that you apply to pulse points. I tend to use both together because individually their silage is quite weak."
4711 Original Eau de Cologne 4711 (unisex),"['citrus', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'white floral']","After a night of insomnia when the first coffee of the day isn't cutting it, this is my go to first-aid saviour scent.
Regardless of what the middle and base notes are supposed to be this scent doesn't hang around long enough to give you that treat. It's a firework of a fragrance - a cologne (which are never designed to last that long anyway) that has no staying power, but don't let that put you off.
This is a splash-it-all-over the face number; a blast of all things citrus - lemon, orange and lime. It's an alarm clock for the flagging body, an ultimate fast hit of speed for the nose.
Buy the 800ml and decant into a smaller bottle for carrying around to apPly often on a tired or hot day."

Noir de Noir Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['earthy', 'rose', 'patchouli', 'warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'woody', 'oud', 'floral', 'balsamic', 'mossy']","Currently experiencing a sample.

Really enjoy how TF has done with the rose note, it is not too light (like Eau Rose from Dyptique), crazy jammy cloyingly sweet (like PdM's Delina), or green stemmy (like Tea Rose from Perfumer's workshop), or dusty like Portrait of A Lady. Noir de Noir presents, at its center, a perfect, fresh, yet dark and inviting black rose. Can't say I smelled ANY other fine rose fragrances like this one :)

In terms of other notes, I also quite enjoy the tart saffron at the beginning, the dry red wine feel (probably from the truffle, vanilla and the patchouli) and the very subtle oud. The perfume seamless morphs from the initial tart saffron, to a lovely, fresh dark rose, adorned by black truffle, and settles into a sweet, dry, and darling mix of wine, oud and vanilla. Very enjoyable and I may as well treat myself to a full bottle :)

Big LOVE. My FAVORITE ROSE scent. (For reference, I'm a classy 40 year-old woman who loves fresh and bold fragrances. I think this fragrance is good for all seasons and all times.)"
Noir de Noir Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['earthy', 'rose', 'patchouli', 'warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'woody', 'oud', 'floral', 'balsamic', 'mossy']","I might get dragged to hell and back for this, but I genuinely disliked how this performed on my skin.

The notes? The craftsmanship? The creativity? The smell on paper? 10/10, but on my skin, Noir de Noir smelled like grape cough syrup on the opening, and a garden supply store on the drydown, with occasional whiffs of the black rose. It brings back strange and almost forgotten memories of my childhood, but due to the opening on my skin, I'm hesitant to try this one again.

I can absolutely appreciate the fusion of Eastern and Western perfume traditions, and am still lifting my arm to sniff it out of pure curiosity and for the nostalgia blast, but this TF is not for me. I'd love to smell it on someone else someday though!"
Noir de Noir Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['earthy', 'rose', 'patchouli', 'warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'woody', 'oud', 'floral', 'balsamic', 'mossy']","Noir de Noir is an absolute masterpiece in modern western perfumery. It is THE essence of Tom Ford’s bold and groundbreaking works with the Private Blend line. NdN is all about balance, taking two extremes and placing them steady on a needle point.

It’s a play of femininity and masculinity, western practices and eastern traditions, a contrast between various shades of darkness and somehow giving those facets colors and dimensions. The dark black rose against the truffles and patchouli create a symphony highlighting the balance between sweet and dry, floral, yet earthy, rich and decadent, but never excessive and weighty. It’s a work of two composers, harmonizing gloriously and what a joy it is to be able to wear this creation!

At first encounter, I absolutely did not like it at all! It was overbearing and too much to handle for a newbie like me years ago. So if you’re new and not into it don’t be too hard on yourself, despite all the praises here. As with almost all of my absolute grails, it’s never love at first sniff. It was more a gradual dissection of each facet and appreciation for how they were integrated together to produce this wonderful creation that allow me to understand what this is. I’m planning on taking my flacon and large bottle to the grave, so I’ll also be smelling excellent in the afterlife too 💁🏻"
Noir de Noir Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['earthy', 'rose', 'patchouli', 'warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'woody', 'oud', 'floral', 'balsamic', 'mossy']","The best Tom Ford fragrance, and one of the best ever rose oud combinations out there. Utterly sexy, dark, decadent and mysterious. It was one of the first few that got me warming up to roses in perfumes, and taking a liking to more heady, darker scents. The rose, although heady, is coated in an airy way, almost like a luxurious soapy rose rather than a jammy one. This is blended in smoothly with the dark truffle, with hints of oud, blanketed by the earthiness of the patchouli. The mixture of the truffle, oud and earthiness almost creates a tobacco or pencil shavings type of smell, in the best way possible. It is deliciously dark, but definitely not at all cloying or too sweet, it has faint hints of sweetness from the rose and truffle flowing evenly throughout. The balance in the sweetness, presence of an earthiness and a slightly cooling feel from the oakmoss, gives it quite a velvety kind of texture, or like the way your fingers would slide smoothly across your dry skin. Despite being dark and heavy, this prevents the scent to be too heavy or cloying in any way, giving it just the right amount of sophistication.

This fragrance simply runs a relay of images of fingers being run across the skin and hair, black outfits, silks and velvet in my head. The feeling of being absolutely confident, feeling sexy, and mysterious, that is Noir de Noir."
Noir de Noir Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['earthy', 'rose', 'patchouli', 'warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'woody', 'oud', 'floral', 'balsamic', 'mossy']",One of of my all time favorites from TF top notch quality
Noir de Noir Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['earthy', 'rose', 'patchouli', 'warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'woody', 'oud', 'floral', 'balsamic', 'mossy']","The best Private Blend and my favourite, well that was until I tested recent batches. It’s pretty much a different scent now. It’s softer, creamier and turns to a skin scent in a hour or so. It’s criminal what TF is doing with his infamous fragrances. Noir de Noir used to be so potent and it’s nowhere near the same level. In a world where many quality niche fragrances are the same price as TF Private blends, I can’t quite get my head around what direction the company is going in. They have discontinued all the best ones, reformulated everything and turning poorly sold PB in too signature line fragrances. It’s gonna take a lot for me to put money back in their pockets."
Noir de Noir Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['earthy', 'rose', 'patchouli', 'warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'woody', 'oud', 'floral', 'balsamic', 'mossy']","I have somehow found myself on a rose kick here recently. I always grew up hating the note, probably due to older women in my life over spraying and filling up every room they were in. However, Tom Ford never seems to disappoint me, at least with his older releases. I stumbled on this one and had to pick it up after hearing so many great things about it!

The reviews were all correct, this thing is glorious, delicious, and just all-around magnificent (this is all coming from someone who doesn't like rose). The notes are compact and well blended in this, it's like a ball of goodness when first sprayed, then it slowly unravels. It opens dark and decadent with the chocolate, rose, and patchouli being the main players.

As it dries down more of that precious rose starts to peak out and then slowly dries down into a mossy-vanilla base that is just scumptious. The performance of this is great, I get a solid 8 hours, easily lasting the entire day. The sillage and projection will make a little bubble around you, not overpowering things around, but making others want to be closer to you.

This is the PERFECT Valentine's Day fragrance, so glad I grabbed a bottle of this! If you have hated rose in the past or have bad memories associated with the note, try this, you may change your mind."
Noir de Noir Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['earthy', 'rose', 'patchouli', 'warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'woody', 'oud', 'floral', 'balsamic', 'mossy']","One of the 12 original Private Blend fragrances from Tom Ford released in 2007, Noir de Noir is a composition whose main purpose was to combine western and eastern notes, as well as mixing male and female accords. Thus, perfumers Harry Fremont and Jacques Cavallier created a cult classic that it is still going strong today amid the many discontinuations across this line.

At the opening, Noir de Noir begins with a sour, almost fermented like rose accord, kind of resembling a combination of sugary shoe polish with some musty rose petals. After 30 minutes or so, this bitter mixture morphs into a dry chocolate scent with the same rose note that not only becomes sweeter like wine, but it is also more prominent than before. Base notes contain the same rose and chocolate accord but with the incorporation of some patchouli undertones. These 3 accords are the most that come across throughout the duration of this fragrance. Great silliage and longevity, especially when compared to some of its Private Blend siblings.

Tom Ford fragrances tend to be very linear; however, I like how the fragrance transitions from its opening notes to the base notes, in which it does indeed switch from a more feminine leaning type to a more unisex phase. Even though vanilla is listed on the notes, it never takes center stage. Instead, the whole fragrance behaves like a tart and acidic russet where chocolate and rose take the whole composition into a dark, sweet, and elegant territory, creating an aura of sophistication, luxury, wealth, and romance, albeit too feminine for my taste. Due to this categorization, if worn under the wrong circumstances it can smell outdated and out of place. I can imagine a woman dressed up, wearing pearl jewelry, going to the ballet wearing Noir de Noir.

I wear when I want to seduce, at night getting close to someone. Sometimes it’s even just for me. It loves the night, it doesn’t like the sunlight, but blooms in the dark. It’s comforting and seductive at the same time. Aloof and powerful. Tasty and earthy. Strong but subtle. It’s sublime"
Noir de Noir Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['earthy', 'rose', 'patchouli', 'warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'woody', 'oud', 'floral', 'balsamic', 'mossy']",Opulence in a bottle. Even if you don't like this you can't help but acknowledge its extremely well done. It's a 10/10. Jammy rose + chocolate. Your biggest problem with this is figuring out how to wear it. I can only imagine wearing it in super formal celebratory settings (eg black tie galas). I can't imagine wearing this casually or to the office. Same class as Dior Homme Parfum in my opinion.

I sprayed this on two separate days and no.. No.. Really not my kind of perfume. This is too dark for me. I am guessing it's the black rose and truffle. This perfume has been given a really good name indeed.

Edit today 10 January 2021: After many tries I'm finally accepting this perfume. I think it's starting to grow on me. 19 January 2021 - Today I finally dare to wear this perfume out. But a bit oversprayed. I can feel the expression on people's face. Hahaha. This is a really nice dark perfume."

Not ok for blind buy. Def unisex. If you love it you LOVE it"
Noir de Noir Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['earthy', 'rose', 'patchouli', 'warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'woody', 'oud', 'floral', 'balsamic', 'mossy']","It is part of my favorite perfume list.
The aromatic composition is dark, elegant , romantic and sensual.
I like how is perceived the rose note , it is like smelling a velvety and red rose petal with some chocolate ( those chocolate bars that have around 70-80% of cacao) , and with a little bit of red wine.

The truffle and vanilla provides smokey and creaminess hints to the rose.
The patchoulli is not too strong and the saffron is well balanced and harmonious.

So this perfume is not the typical rose-middle eastern scent, neither a powdery-fresh rose scent.

Actually, when I perceive this perfume I visualize several objects like ; a dark red-velvet rose bouquet, wine tone lipsticks, leathery men’s boots and jackets.


This perfume is all about Italian culinary and design culture.
It reminds me allot when I used to have dinner with my family in Italian restaurants ( , both, in Mexico, London and Paris).

Also it has a leathery note ( very pleasant ).

It is curious that for some people this perfume reminds them to some of the members of their family.

But for me , this perfume reminds me of several erotic and intimate memories ; the rose in this perfume is simply sensual, velvety and provocative.

This perfume, from my personal point of view ( and also experience ) is perfect for special occasions during night life.

This perfume will be enjoyable for those people that are in their 20s onwards , otherwise, for teenagers , the aromatic composition could be very strong.

I have to admit , I would buy it again, I still have almost the half of the bottle; but I really like it and I used to combine it with other perfumes and essential oils.

I like how it is perceived in the skin, it provides a warm and sensual feeling; but in clothes and leathery accessories it last hours and can be a little bit cloying if it is applied too much.

For me it has everything I want from a perfume; definitely when I don’t know what to wear and I have to be ready for a romantic ( and passionate) date I use this special poison.

I think this perfume blooms and provides that sensual emanation with casual and elegant dark tone clothes(fabrics like ; silk, satin cotton, cashmere , fur and leather )."

Noir de Noir Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['earthy', 'rose', 'patchouli', 'warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'woody', 'oud', 'floral', 'balsamic', 'mossy']","What an amazing creation! An inspired combination of notes. Who would have thought to add truffle to a rose fragrance? It's a mushroom! But it works here, combining perfectly with the earthy patchouli and oud to darken and intensify everything. Probably not coincidentally, Wikipedia says this of truffles: ""The sweaty-musky aroma of truffles is similar to that of the pheromone 'androstenol' that also occurs in humans"". Very Tom Ford.

Although it has rose as its primary note, and would be ideal for romantic and intimate encounters, I get such an air of mysteriousness and almost emotional coldness to it. Perhaps I'm mistaking coldness for something more assertive or domineering. Maybe that's why several have mentioned Dracula's name. Dark, charismatic, a bit of a romantic but with an edge. In this vein [!!], I remember someone else describing the similar-smelling TF Noir for Men as being like a panther - dark, smooth but deadly; that almost black, dark-grey shade of purple. That suits this too.

Be that as it may, I’m currently going through a look-at-me phase in my fragrance life, so this feels more like a black house cat. I'd love for Tom to bring out an extract version, give it some welly, and for the black panther to bite my head off.

PS - Why is this listed as a chypre? It doesn't smell like one in the slightest. Classifications of this manner (based solely on ingredients) really have no use. It's such skewed logic. I can see the reasoning, and agree it works on most cases, but if it doesn't smell like a chypre an alternate classification should trump it. (Compare NdN to Amouage Gold PH: Gold smells like a chypre; neither have bergamot; NdN gets 'chypred' despite everything.)"

I am confused by the un-sweetened spicy saffron opening - it was almost repulsive. But then the fragrance opened up... and what I got was a lot of stewed fruit with a tiny hint of rose. The overall effect is pretty good, but this fragrance reads very mature to me. Definitely not my cup of tea. If I were a “I do as I please” woman in my sixties, I would absolutely wear this. Maybe in another life."

The fragrance at this stage smells like rose dipped in melted chocolate. It is sweet, rosy, dark and earthy. In the late drydown, an oakmoss accord starts appearing to give a chypre feeling to the scent. Overall, it is a beautiful dark rose fragrance."

Don't get me wrong, it is a lovely scent, but frankly, there are better.
To me, it just smells too much like other perfumes for its price... if I was investing that amount of money, I'd rather go with the more unique Tom Ford Noir Extreme, which to me, feels like it has more complexity and warmth; if Noir Extreme to you feels like it smells too much like something else, please do message me with suggestions!

I find the name quite fitting, as to me it somehow emanates a gothic kind of vibe, rather dark in nature and thus more of a night time (and perhaps cooler weather oriented) scent.

The comparisons to Turkish delight are spot on in my opinion, this one does indeed have a gourmandy facet, although I would not put it in that category. Noir de Noir is one of the Private Blends that to me leans rather feminine (which I enjoy), although of course it is unisex and can be worn by a man - perhaps by a slightly more mature man though (30+?), and rather with a more formal/business attire. I just can´t imagine this one with a T-Shirt and jeans - that goes for the ladies as well.

Performance on my skin is a bit of a mixed bag, somehow. Very strong projection and sillage for the first two hours (and I mean VERY strong, as in filling the floor of your office building, so be careful), but I do not get quite the longevity I expected from the notes profile and bearing in mind the powerhouse longevity of, say, Tobacco Vanille. On me, NdN becomes a skin scent about three hours in and is pretty much gone after five hours. Still, I love this one for its sensual and rich, enveloping aura.

Scent 9/10
Longevity 6/10
Projection 8/10 (for the first two hours a 20/10)

On her, it is rich vintage powdery elegance, with a bit of a flat plastic note that complemented the new car smell.
On myself, it was certainly interesting, and evocative, I just wasn’t sure it’s a scene I want to evoke...
The wine-like dried fruit opening starts overly sweet, like the fruit has gone slightly rancid before being dried. The plastic note held moldy potpourri roses, skanky patchouli and an incense not burning, but settled into dusty fabric over time.
I expected elegant decadence...
Instead I’m wine drunk at a house party, making out with a stoner boy, in a dank basement with hippie tapestries; his deodorant has worn off and he tastes of marijuana and the tobacco that he wrapped it in. The floor is sticky and there is a hint of vomit mingling with the rose potpourri wafting from the basement bathroom. I thought this was gonna be fun, but now I’m questioning my decisions and getting claustrophobic.

A fragrance is like a time machine in my opinion.
I’m sure that you guys know that scents reminds us of certain events, person, or place.
It may be bad or good for each and every one of us, I try to make it into something positive most of the time.
I said Noir De Noir smells like my grandmother is because she was a fraghead and she loves the scent of rose. When I was still young and I always stayed with her during weekends and vacations, she always smells great and I can still remember her perfume collection by her bedside table.
Sadly, she passed away on New Years Eve 1997 when I was 15 years old. Up until now I always wish she’s still with me because 15 was just not enough.
So when I smelled Noir De Noir for the first time it just reminded me of my younger days with my grandmother.
She loves roses and the roses in Noir De Noir reminds of the perfumes she used to wear.
I bought the 100 ml. because it’s like a time machine that brings me back to the great times with my grandmother, she and my mom were the only two people that was always there for me when my family was a mess. I love them both to death.
I’m not going too be specific about the fragrance, there are alot of great reviews below already. I just want to say that this is priceless because of the great memories it brings me.

Noir de Noir Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['earthy', 'rose', 'patchouli', 'warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'woody', 'oud', 'floral', 'balsamic', 'mossy']","Tom Ford Noir De Noir opens with a moderate projection of sweet saffron, but the accord lasts for just a few seconds. Almost immediately the fragrance brings an intense green and herbaceous patchouli with rose and truffle accords. The patchouli is a dominant note and adds a classy, old-school vibe. The rose and floral accords are next leaning the fragrance to the feminine side. The truffle creates a very earthy and musky accord. As the fragrance commences to dry-down, the oud becomes prominent. The combination of oud, patchouli, and truffle creates a pungent, green, slightly animalic, musky, and dark wood accord, borderline offensive. The vanilla is a faint touch. The most noticeable change from the opening to the dry-down is the quick and very sweet visit of the saffron which fades away in just a few seconds, after that, the oud, patchouli, and truffle dominate the fragrance with a strong pungent accord counterbalanced by the intense rose and floral accords. Once Tom Ford Noir De Noir has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a strong projection, pungent oud, patchouli, and roses fragrance with faint vanilla accords. The fragrance feels slightly animalic, bold, classy, exotic, floral, herbaceous, earthy, imposing, mature, musky, nocturnal, old-school, powerful, pungent, rotten wood-like, and mildly pleasant.

It is beautifully blended. All in all it is a ROSE perfume.

Okay, it's a unisex scent, but I couldn't resist the comparison. While I respect POAL, I find it leans too feminine for me. Noir de Noir is definitely not one for the ultra-masculine guys out there, but those with confidence in themselves can pull this off with style. It has a touch of that grandma rose, but the other elements redress the balance.
This is essentially a rose/patchouli fragrance (like POAL), but is also modernised with aspects of another Tom Ford classic: Black Orchid. The black truffle is so sensual and interesting, and immediately elevates this above anything else in the genre.
The name is very apt here. The notes are listed as black rose and black truffle, giving emphasis to how dark this fragrance is trying to be. It achieves it. The rose is not fresh or soapy and the patchouli adds a real earthiness which grounds the whole composition. A touch of oud in the backgrounds deepens the scent further. It's deep, dark and brooding, whilst also being sensual and addictive.
There is a bit of a sourness in the opening which thankfully passes as it can come across as off-putting. Others talk about a chocolate smell which I don't really get, but there is definitely a mouth-watering quality to it.
I would wear this as I love the smell, but smelling it off of another person (preferably a woman) would be the ideal scenario. If somebody walks past me wearing this, you best believe that I'm going to notice. I hate to use this word because it is so overused, but NdN really is sexy.

I like it a lot, potentially bottle-worthy.

Like on the skin- deep inhale to take it all in. It’s very intoxicating it almost makes my head spin in a hypnotic/spell bound way. The transition from the top note of “bright” saffron to truffled roses is so smooth. This is where I start to smell some red wine that’s slightly sour yet mouth watering. To me, the first 30 minutes of this perfume are the most interesting. During the dry down, you lose the sour note and finish with a lovely soft rose and slight earthiness in the background. A very sophisticated scent- I get the vibe of a dark room. It’s very unisex because to me the wearer is already confident in who they are and this fragrance enhances and plays into that confidence. I am younger so this feels like a special occasion fragrance, and I likely have enough in the sample to last me for a while."

I would describe Black Orchid and Noir the same way.

The main vibe here is a very jammy rose, with some other things going on in the background to make it more complex. The jamminess makes it lean feminine in my opinion.

Noir de Noir Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['earthy', 'rose', 'patchouli', 'warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'woody', 'oud', 'floral', 'balsamic', 'mossy']","A dark rose that’s as appropriate to wear at Halloween as it is on Valentine’s Day. Black truffle, patchouli and vanilla give the olfactory illusion of the rose being dipped in chocolate and the richness of the notes suggests a full-bodied red wine, a Malbec or Syrah, although oud is always in the background hinting at something more sinister. Noir de Noir is indeed Valentine’s Day in a bottle, although if you’re a man and your date wears this never turn your back.

For me this is also the scent of the Carpathians, black truffles sourced from the hillsides, the last Bulgarian roses picked in autumn, tree moss chipped from wet bark and saffron and oud imported from the Middle East, which eastern Europe has always had a close association with due to its geographical location. Worn by a dark-haired woman with red lipstick and a black dress to the now-abandoned Casino Constanta in its heyday: a mistress, a courtesan or something else?

A man wearing Noir de Noir would be distinctive and make an impression; a woman in Noir de Noir would only do it true justice wearing a slinky dress, wine-red lipstick, cigarette, black garter and a handgun in the drawer of her bedside table.

Wear Noir de Noir on February 14th next year (the origin of Valentine’s Day is much darker than a cute little angel with a bow and arrow would suggest), fancy yourself a femme fatale or if you’re fascinated by people such as late antiquities collector Bill Jamieson and Countess Elizabeth Bathory de Ecsed."

This has the ""bad breathy"" vibe that other old school fragrances have because of the prominent patchouli.

Give it a few days of wearing. The patchouli here is one of the more beginner-friendly ones. It's tempered by the rose and whatever makes it smell mildly wine-like. As it starts to enter the mids after around an hour, the old school vibe dissipates and that's when it starts smelling like dark chocolate.

The rose is deep however this is not a pretty, fresh rose. This is a dark rose, if it had a colour it would be a dark red almost burgundy colour. The rose is followed by one of my favorite notes, earthy delicious patchouli and a spiciness i assume is the saffron. The patchouli calms down and moves to the background but still hangs around like a background singer with the truffle mixing together to give the dark red rose some earthiness. This makes it smell like a freshly plucked rose that you picked up with the earth still clinging to the flower. It's a rich earthy deep rose with the patchouli and truffle adding an interesting earthiness, a touch of spiciness from saffron makes this composition press your nose to your wrist addictive. The dry down brings in a bit of vanilla but it's not sweet at all just adds extra depth to an already deep, rich scent. it's an earthy, spicy rose.

Noir de Noir Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['earthy', 'rose', 'patchouli', 'warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'woody', 'oud', 'floral', 'balsamic', 'mossy']","Very linear chord fragrance of truffled rose, where the other notes only deepen and enrich these two, which go hand in hand from the beginning to total drydown: rose and truffle. However, why anything else, when you have such good partnership? Again, a fragrance whose glimpse at the notes or the marketing greatly prejudices the judgment, for I see TF marketing and people calling it dark...well, it is not luminous, but it is also far from something dark - it is a simple, inviting, open aroma, as it would be when guided by any feminine and magnanimous flower, but especially by the very sharp rose here (in a ""dry-citrus"" style, fragrantica calls it ""fresh lemony"" or something like that, don't know how to describe it well), but at the same time more formal, as one would expect from occasions that ask for roses - because it is a flower so well worn by nature. That is, very versatile. In drydown, the velvety and sweet truffle reaches and even stands out from the rose for me, guaranteeing a prolonged satisfaction also in this final phase of the perfume. Unisex and especially more inviting for use by men. Projects nicely for 2 hours."

This is the best rose scent I've ever smelled. A dark, red velvety rose with dashes of dark chocolate, vanilla and patchouli. This is smooth as butter, very well-blended. Everyone below me has described this in great detail. It smells like its pricetag, very expensive. Now, if you're expecting a sillage and projection monster, you will not get that. I imagine the perfumers intended it to last long, but stick close to the skin for hours. This scent is designed for close encounters, not to fill a room. I would highly recommend this. For the pricetag though, I would sample before committing to a FB. One more thing, this scent is very romantic and feminine to me. I'm not sure how a man could pull this off. Granted, different notes shine on male skin than female skin. Just letting the dudes know that this is very sweet and rosy, but there are earthy nuances to it. Try before buying!"

Although the rose is not convincing to me (more lychee than floral), it's blended very well with the vanilla, truffle and light patchouli. At some point, it reminds me of some Bic perfume (cheapy from early 90's) in a good way, can't remember which one. It's a very seductive scent, perfect for a date (unisex), less so for day to day (at least not for men). It doesn't project but stays close to the skin for hours. Though, $4 per ml is really prohibitive to me for this type of fragrance."

Although not on a Creed level, where everything since 2016 has been diluted with Evian.
My Noir de Noir is from 2015 and performs amazingly. My mums from 2017 is pretty much a skin scent 10 mins after application. My first Patchouli Absolu from 2014 was a beast for projection. When that ran out I got another bottle from the TF boutique (batch 2017) and that was an awful performer. Returned it and was given an exchange for a bottle from 2018 and that one is just like my first bottle.
I don't think there's any logic behind these, they must just be bad eggs. I would suggest not being afraid to call TF out for it, and return it to the retailer if it happens. A lot of people seem to assume it's just the line as a whole and suck it up, but we pay way too much to have to put up with bad batches.

Yes, Noir de Noir may seem populated by Valentine’s Day tropes of roses, wine and chocolate but they are upturned by the cold, cruel touch of a creature that has just been freed from its entombment and seeking proverbial vengeance from the grave.

It dresses in a palette of blacks and burgundies, swagging arch and mannered over earthy floors and smooth oriental rugs of mushroomy-patch and dry vanilla amber redolent of bonbon fillings of rose fondant/ganache that arrive in anonymous laced boxes at the doorstep of the unsuspicious prey.

I would not classify it as a “gourmand” however, it skips all the warmth and sugar rhapsody into the gloomy gothic with some caustic chypre elements, a dark oriental cape over an unisex, velvet tux and a stamp of Maila Nurmi lacquered red lips."

That is the theme of Noir de Noir for me.

Elevated, highest vibration romance. The merging of galaxies; Soulmates. Intensely emotional. Deeply in love. The most beautiful of all dreams. It reminds me of my Love & aspects of myself; deep, dark, passionate, serious, sensitive, Scorpio. Earthy, grounded & rich with a beautiful, elegant sweetness reserved for the right one. A velvety rose, as spiritual as it is sensual. I don’t care to gender perfume at all. I always dreamed of smelling this on the right man (— Mine), & I love it on myself. A quiet confidence that can’t be shaken; a girl/woman who would rather read, dance & dreamily lounge around in exquisite lingerie that she collects & dream her own world, explore forests, oceans, stars & herself, than be among the noisy masses, but will make exceptions or travel to see her favourite artists. A man unafraid to embrace his femininity as fully as masculinity, worlds beyond lesser men who cannot. An introverted musician, painter, artist, who does not lack the ability to defend & kill if necessary. Swoon…

This dream is my reality.

It also reminds me of all of the old world, architectural beauty of Paris & refinement of Parisian culture.

I do not own a bottle but have been sustaining myself with samples from Luckyscent. This is about to change. If you would like to sell a bottle, please contact me.

When I met Noir de Noir,I was still in the very beginning of my perfume discovering.Reading reviews, sniffing around at the department stores.

I stopped by the tom ford counter in the department store to try the different smells... I smelled this and... I thought I was gonna cry... seriously.... no way! It's like all I wanted, but I didn't know that I wanted it, or I didn't know what it smelled like, well, this is what it smelled like! out of this world beautiful. I felt myself shivering.

I looked online and got a bottle for a good price.

It's now autumn again... I opened my cabinet and reached for Noir de Noir, I'm not going out, I just missed you! I sprayed it on my arm, afraid that my love for her would have withered, within this year of smelling so many different, weird, quirky, interesting scents I never knew existed before my first encounter with Noir de Noir..

No sir! The same shiver, the same enchantment and excitement as the first encounter is what I got, a big smile on my face and wanting to jump up and down.

Noir de Noir, is now deemed, my first and forever love in the world of high perfumery."

At first, Noir de Noir is almost like a fresh, vanillic men's spicy cologne, then starts getting more rosy/femme. 5-10 mins in I get earthy ""dirt"" facets (not bitter, just earth). That aspect made me think maybe it is too ""mature"" for me. I'm not really into that dimension

But now the earthiness is fading a bit and I am getting this smooooth vanilla spicy wood. Is that the oud? My first oud?! The rose is faintly and so pleasant. Like Lost Cherry, this fragrance is so complex and interesting to me as my brain tries to make sense of it.

It isn't exactly what I am looking for, but I feel I am getting warmer (vanilla, spice, rose, chocolate, tasteful wood...)

Edit: The next morning, only the earthy parts seem to have stuck on my skin. :/ But someone else will love this."

I was on the fence about this one, not liking a dominant Rose note, but 2 of my favorite top 10s, are non rose dominant: MFK Lumiere Noir PH, and Creed Royal Mayfair.

I am starting to like this a lot as well, and it may be my next Winter bottle for Christmas.
It has some of the chocolate note, as Tobacco Vanille, and the safron from Tuscan Leather. I do think there is an unlisted coffee note, as Cafe Tuberosa has, which is a clone of Noir de Noir.

I love patchouli, and earthy fragrances. I see Noir de Noir as more of a dank, earthy, moss, patch, and truffle frag; with a very good dark rose, that elivates it out of the dirty earthy vib, along with a touch of safron.

It smells simple, and tight, in a very good classic kind of way. I just tried Bond Bleaker Street, its nice, and gimicky, like so many good frags; But Noir de Noir is special. It's a substantial fragrance, that will remain a classic winner.

It is dark, heavy, sexy and seductive.

When I first tested this one evening at a department store, and drove home with it, I kept sniffing my wrist, and kept getting this image in my head of a pale-skinned vixen with dark hair, a dark dress, red lipstick, in charge of whatever night venue she might be attending.

Men can wear it too (I am a man), but only only only in night-time, seductive environments... otherwise just... no.

I am not into ""dark"" and ""devilish"" stuff, but the scent itself just gave me this vibe of, well, if someone were into dark and obscure and even devilish stuff (you figure out what that means), this is what they would wear. Doesn't smell bad or evil per se, but those into dark seduction would be into this.

Heavy rose, chocolaty, sensual smell, almost sexual, meant for night wear, giving a deep sexy, mysterious, alluring and emotional vibe.

It‘ stunning and overall and incredible perfume.

Very dark and deep rose, dipped in dark chocolate. Saffron, oud, truffle and patchouli. I do not really get the oakmoss and vanilla as stated here on Fragrantica. Perhaps the other ingredients are simply too potent and take over the show. I would still not classify this as a rose scent. It is there but still not very dominant. A beautiful blend.
This is wild, very earthy and dark. Be careful with the sprayer. For me 1,5 spray is more than enough.

Initially I got a 4 ml tester from TF counter some months ago and I was raving about this. Finally opened up my wallet and got a 50 ml bottle.
What an incredible scent... it is so different
This is a perfume for the evening. For a date or a dinner with friends or preferably with someone you want to seduce.
Or daytime on the weekends when you want to feel sexy :)

It is for sure not an office scent. It almost makes it difficult to concentrate on work when wearing this. I tried one day by early April, it was just too much.

I would also classify this mostly as a fall / winter scent. Wearing a wool sweater and a light spray of NdN. I just got my bottle the other week and it is now summer in Europe, NdN is simply to much to handle in the summer. I´m keeping it in the fridge and wait for fall.

An interesting observation from my side is that the bottle I got is even more dark and heavy than the 4 ml tester. I compare it arm to arm and the sample feels a bit lighter. I never really noticed differences in batches and did not care much about it but here I do smell the difference. My bottle feels like the oud and truffle is stronger than in the tester. I got my bottle at a TF counter at an airport so I am pretty sure it is not a fake one.

Longevity is insane. From early morning to late evening. The first 6 hours the projection is heavy and penetrating. So once again, be very careful with the sprayer. Then it settles down, becomes more tamed and sits closer to the skin for another 6–10 hours.
I feel like my 50 ml bottle will last me for years and somehow wish there was a 30 ml of this beautiful perfume instead."

I'm new to perfume. I can only tell you how I think it smells, and how it makes me feel, both of which are likely to be different from others' experiences.

I smell rose, the most appealing of all the rose notes I've tested so far, perhaps because the color I get in my head is not bright red or bright pink, but a deep black/red color when I smell it. The color looks velvety. Maybe this is the truffle? You know how your eyes feel when the lights shut off and it's kindof a relief for your brain? The color I get from this scent is like that. A black-burgundy velvet eye mask. Soothing but sexy, yes?

I smell something warm and chocolatey, but not too spicy. Comfortingly warm, like a hug. But there's depth to the hug. It's not just a ""hi, friend!"" hug. It's like a hug from someone who is secretly pining for you but will never tell you. Comforting, but hopelessly romantic, yes?

I don't know how Tom Ford (and the perfume magicians) can make me feel soothed and aroused, content and full of longing, all at the same time, but it suits me down to the ground."

It doesn’t burn the nostrils like Black Oud, or wither flowers like Silk Mood, or pierce flesh like Bull’s Blood. It steers clear of the mire of sticky, generic-smelling coumarin such as you find in Rose D’Arabie, Back to Black, and Man in Black.

This masterpiece is a lacy, pillowy rose enshrined in a powdery accord of vanilla, oud, and patchouli. The rose isn’t simply red, but so deeply red that it’s pure black.

Noir de Noir Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['earthy', 'rose', 'patchouli', 'warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'woody', 'oud', 'floral', 'balsamic', 'mossy']","As far as I'm concerned, this is probably Tom Ford's best fragrance.
I use it frequently and do consider this perfume more masculine than feminine although it is qualified as unisex. Well... it's maybe acceptable.
This is a very well blended floral-spicy-oriental fragrance and very black. I find it a semi-dark to dark perfume. It's semi-dark because it's subtle and it's dark because it has really some gloomy and black notes. That blackiness completely outlines this perfume and its evolution. I already tried to layer it with other dark and non dark scents but with very poor success in my findings so far. It seems to be perfect as it is.
The perfume opens very smoothly, like someone slowly approaching with slippers. It's quite a soft and intimate saffron starting this scent journey, however a bit leathery and bittersweet.This note does prevail for a while but the global scent evolution surprises us with a powerful rose, a dark persistent rose that sticks around almost all through the perfume life.The rose note gives you nuances of powder and black woods. It's a dark, dirty and woody accord of a special rose... marvelous!
I am not a rose scent fancier but I really like this composition. Probably due to the heart notes support (flowers and truffles), the dark rose scent is emphasized with a musky, earthy and pungent aroma.
The base notes set a peaceful oud frame with earthy patchouli and lightly sweet vanilla, but the dark gloomy rose persists for quite a while. The agar wood note is not prominent but does have a base role in the fragrance shadowy evolution.
As the time passes, the dry down becomes a bit more sweet and powdery.
The perfume does give a strong impression of class and sophistication, with an above average longevity but with an average projection. Probably it is what's correct for this upscale fragrance. Excessive projection would be annoying. The scent is not cloying. The darker accords are never to proeminent and offer an excellent near skin performance. I do consider this perfume to be very well designed and perfectly blended. I have a faint heart for this type of obscure scents and I find it very alluring and sexy.
However the world is not perfect and this scent it's not an universal pleaser. It has probably as many haters as lovers. Many people reject the subtle overlaying obscure shadow present in all the stages of this fragrance. After all ""cést un parfum noir de noir"" (it's a black perfume of black).
I love it and consider it a real masterpiece... La crème de la crème de Tom Ford!
There is just one concern.... its price! I can only consider it quite expensive, specially when there is a very well blended similar fragrance - Armaf Club de Nuit Intense for Women - costing 10% to 15% of the Noir de Noir price.
Nevertheless and as far as I'm concerned, this is probably Tom Ford's best fragrance.

Keep your scent high!"
Noir de Noir Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['earthy', 'rose', 'patchouli', 'warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'woody', 'oud', 'floral', 'balsamic', 'mossy']","The was the first Tom Ford I managed to get my hands on!

I am still mind blown. The note breakdown made me think this would be similar to the Rose-Oud combo in Middle Eastern fragrances, maybe on the lines of EL Amber Mystique or Armani Rose D'Arabie - both of which I really enjoy.

But this one is surprisingly modern - and ethereal the way that it is. The rose lends it a lush richness, but it retains its natural lightness rather than turning into a jammy, caramelised rose. The Oud is very much there but never overpowers the rose. The truffle and saffron (not heavy at all) lend some warmth and earthiness, but the oakmoss brings with it enough freshness to ensure this is never cloying. And the whole composition is brought together by a beautifully refined patchouli - it doesn't lose its spunk but at the same time it doesn't cross the fine line that makes it unpleasant. In its extreme dry down, it does resemble the last few hours of Mugler's Angel, but this is evidently way more refined.

Longevity and sillage are STELLAR; I have never had a perfume perform this well on me. Absolutely worth every penny. A fantastic composition and quite versatile. Except a hot day at the beach, I cannot think of an occasion where this would be inappropriate .

My only worry is the talk about this having been reformulated :-("

Beautiful blend of rose, patchouli, oud, and truffle. Opening and first few hours lean more feminine because the rose dominates. The dry down tho... patchouli takes over as the main note, just a little hint of vanilla comes along and rose takes the subtle role I like it to have and this becomes an incredibly sexy and masculine woody, green, sweet scent.

I would 100% buy a full bottle if the entire fragrance smelled like it's dry down: More prominent patchouli and subtle rose with more sweet woody notes. But as it stands, it's only a ""like"" for me. Many other fragrances ahead of it in my shopping list."

My first thought was, this smells like Club de Nuit Intense by Armaf, but then I was thinking it's a bit sharper and richer, perhaps a touch more floral/""feminine"" as well. In any case, with these kinds of fragrances, I prefer a more toned-down quality, and since I already have a bottle of CdNI, there would be no reason to buy a bottle of this one. I'll update if anything changes over time.

UPDATE: The drydown seems more gourmand than CdNI and overall it has a ""brighter""' quality; it also seems sweeter. So, I'd have to do a side by side test but I'd say now that CdNI is more unisex than NdN, but it's a matter of preference, because I can't say that one is clearly ""superior"" to the other, but then there is the massive price difference."

She just came off a mission and arrived a few minutes late to an upscale formal event happening tonight. Draped in a deep blood red, backless, low cut dress with a dark red lip and sky-high heels, she is taller than most of the guests. Her long raven hair is loosely curled and put into an unconstrained low bun, wavy tendrils falling over her forehead, shaping her beautiful tan face elegantly, her beauty rivals Aphrodite herself. The small smirk on her face tells everyone to be wary, she knows things she shouldn't and if the wrong people got a hold of her knowledge.. she could start diplomatic wars. Her scent is alluring as it is mysterious reeling in bystanders (like an unsuspecting fly diving straight into a pot of honey, unware that the sweetest of treats has the ability to destroy their lives within seconds) She has a haunting presence. She may seem delicate like a rose, but look closer and you can see just how destructive she can get; her thorns will rip your flesh if you pose a threat to her.
She captures images of thick, bitter dark chocolate slowly dripping inwards of a full blossomed dark rose’s bud.
She walks toward the darkness as the midnight ink swallows her whole, only her sensual scent trail remians.. She will always be your greatest mystery.

Absolutely identical to a fragrance called Velvet by Scent Maker, which a Kuwaiti brand!

That got me thinking, as a Middle Easterner, this is not the 1st time I smell a Tom Ford fragrance that I find very familiar only to recall an exact smell by another local Arabic brand.

Is TF ripping people off by copying old scents from unknown parts & presenting them to the North American & European markets at extremely high prices as his ""private collection""? Or are the Arabic brands copying him? I've smelled fragrance in chronological order that support both cases.

I've had the same experience with Montale, too.

Quite possibly both the sexiest and most sexual fragrance I have ever encountered. Huge compliment getter as well. If I had to describe it in one word-passionate."

I bought Tom Ford Patchouli Absolu and got TF Noir De Noir as a sample bottle. I layered them wearing them to a work night out Christmas party and within 10 minutes had my first compliment from a passing woman who told me I smelled amazing to the consternation of her partner. What was even better is that she was a very classy looking lady with a younger better looking partner than me. I felt like I owned the evening, layering in a little level of conceit and confidence. I became the man in the advert, I was transported outwith myself with this scent; I became the rose and the patchouli, I became the antihero of the evening. Anti hero? yes, as with this scent you are every mans nemesis a threat to his insecurities. I feel that layering it with PA it becomes a little more masculine and adds to the longevity.

Definitely.
How could I know it?
Because wearing this perfume is like watching a movie.

Take 1 - Morticia is cutting the buds off of roses, which she discards, keeping only the stems.
Take 2 - Morticia is walking through the family cemetery in the night, the air is humid and smells like wet leaves and soil.
Take 3 - Morticia is preparing some mysterious potion consisting of dried saffron, vanilla seeds & tuber essence.

The potion is as ""noir"" as it can be, deeply sweet, with a light spicy undertone & balsamic/earthy mist in the background.

This fragrance is... I´d like to use word ""enigmatic"" /just like Morticia is/.

And I must confess this matter of fact - my Halloween costume was Morticia this year. And yes - I put this perfume on. I think that the illusion was perfect, children were crossing the street when they noticed me. Well done, Noir de Noir, well done."

Floral, sweet, and at the same time masculine. Sexy, indulgent (just as Tom Ford the man himself describes it). My top Tom Ford Private Blend next to Tobacco Oud.

Noir de Noir Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['earthy', 'rose', 'patchouli', 'warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'woody', 'oud', 'floral', 'balsamic', 'mossy']","I disagree with the reviewer below me. I received my 10ml decant of Noir de Noir recently, and today while I was running late to run errands, I sprayed a single spray on my chest, and 13 hours later I can still get whiffs of it. Maybe the decant I own was decanted from the vintage/pre-reformulation batch, and as everyone know, this perfume has been reformulated in the past. So far, I am impressed with the performance and projection of this scent. I grew up in the middle east, and I reckon that a majority of the Saudi people I encountered wear NdN. When I first received it, I couldn't put a single finger on where I had smelled it before but, then I was like YES THATS THE SCENT I KNOW VERY WELL. Middle eastern people are known for their taste in expensive and fine fragrances, and I credit them for evoking and nurturing my admiration for scents that I have today.

Anyway back to the performance of the scent, it smells like a mixture of pat-vanilla-rose, and so far I cannot smell oud or chocolate in any of its phase. My nose is acoustomed to oud, and so far, I detect none. Perhaps I need to compound the number of sprays to get a full effect of this magical potion. This stuff is potent, and I find that one spray can give me a projection of 3-4 feet. I will update once I compound the number of sprays when there is an occasion or reason to do so."

My husband bought this perfume at the duty-free in the airport and he told me that, the tester was so strong and long-lasting. In fact that I could smell it for hours on the paper test. My daughter tried too and the same: as soon as you spray it, is gone. Tom Ford should be ashamed asking such a high price for a bottle of water!!!!

It might be of interest to those of you who love a layered rose scent. It starts off with an opening that is very much about saffron. Noir de Noir is smoothly blended, so much so that the saffron is mildly detected under the sweet rising heart note of semi-sweet chocolate. There is a bit of an alcohol wave here that is like a candied dark liqueur, warm and smooth. Once the liqueur sensation gives way, Noir de Noir opens up to a brooding, dark rose and truffle scent. The heart notes take their time settling in, and it isn't until the dry-down that you can appreciate the blending of the vanilla, rose, truffle and chocolate hovering over a slightly earthy patchouli. There was some confusion by Noir de Noir in the beginning by its imposing dark and mysteriously sweet personality. This fragrance walks a fine line as being unisex and is just a tad more feminine that Tom Ford would like you to believe. Sample first, but it might be love at it first sniff."

It all began approximately a month and a half ago when I finally tried Noir de Noir for the first time, and I owe a thank you to two lovely ladies, osandra and Eyviab.

Noir de Noir was never even on my radar to try with rose being listed as the most prominent note; I like rose, but not ROSE. However, when I was asking for suggestions in the the forum, the amazing osandra mentioned this one; so I finally decided to buy a sample and test it. Admittedly, I was not expecting much, but after that first whiff from the sample, I was in love.

...And down the rabbit hole, I fell.

Over the next month, I wore through over an ounce worth of Noir de Noir decants, wearing it almost everyday FOR A MONTH! Oooooh, it is THAT good. Then Eyviab, being the angel that she is, sold me her bottle. Muah! Considering how often I have been wearing my new treasure, I thought it wise to invest in a back-up as well.

I know that I am a very selective perfumista, and I am perfectly content not having a huge wardrobe, but I have still had my nose on many, MANY different fragrances. Throughout all of my sniffing, Noir de Noir is one of the very few that I consider ""Shalimar status"", and if you know how I feel about Shalimar, then you know that is the highest compliment I can give another fragrance.

I agree with others that this is Valentine's Day in a bottle; it's so rich, deep, romantic and compelling, and dare I say the best chocolate fragrance.

Sure, there are tons of other rose-patch fragrances, rose-oud perfumes, and rose-patch-oud combinations, but none of them are quite like Noir de Noir."

A lush rose spiced up with saffron and a sweet hint of vanilla all on a bed of green patchouli leaves with a wisp of oakmoss and the resinous, woody smell of oud and earthy tuber. This is like wearing black velvet and carrying a bouquet of red roses to a cemetery at night, there is something dark and somber about it yet very serene. Absolutely gorgeous fragrance!"
Noir de Noir Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['earthy', 'rose', 'patchouli', 'warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'woody', 'oud', 'floral', 'balsamic', 'mossy']","Tom Ford Private Blend Collection has struck me in such a way, that I want to own one or two of his fragrances. I am quite familiar with his offerings. I own Black Orchid (the EDP for women) which I absolutely love! Lately I have had quite an interest in Noir De Noir. Josh Donaldson, my favorite baseball player, kind of inspired me to want this fragrance. I have smelt it about a year ago. I love the use of black rose, which does not make it too feminine. The black truffle is also a great earthy tone that pairs well with the vanilla and patchouli. The patchouli gives it a floral vibe which is great. All around, this scent is unique and certainly one that will get you noticed.

So, I went out to Holt Renfrew this afternoon and first sprayed this on myself to help me decide. I gave it some time. I walked around the mall for almost an hour, I came back and I bought it. This fragrance is absolutely astounding! It's very seductive, floral, sweet (not gourmand) and certainly the secret weapon on almost anyone's collection. It is certainly unisex, but I feel depending on the wearer, they make it their own. It has great longevity and sillage, certainly is something unlike any other that I own. Tom Ford did an amazing job with Noir De Noir. This marks my first Private Blend purchase. I am now a proud owner of his masterpiece."

Love at first sniff.
Despite reviews warning to only use a couple of sprays, I used quite a few. Wrists, inner forearms, collarbones, neck, chest and belly. It didn't open with a huge blast, for me. But oh, oh, ohhhh...how I LOVE the opening. Sweet, so sweet, the rose, but with a luscious dark undertone to it, almost gourmand.

Within the first hour I detected a clearly animalic note. I am a fan of animalic accords, so this is not at all off-putting to me. A hint of fecal, also, but it was very fleeting - the truffle, I suppose. Dirtiness underneath the sweetness of the rose. What a sexy, sexy scent.

It's interesting. Under my clothes, the perfume took on a much more masculine aspect - all leather, oakmoss, patchouli and oud. On my arms, candied rose sweetness with a hint of saffron.

The vanilla never appeared for me as a clearly defined note and didn't present itself in the lovely warm and lingering dry down I had anticipated, but which never came. Which was disappointing.

The longevity and projection weren't as great as I had expected from the reviews of others here, which was the second disappointment for me and what would stop me from saving my pennies to own a full bottle. I'll try it again in a month or so with what's left of the sample."

I also get high quality fruity tones from it, though there are no such notes listed. I especially like that aspect of it.

Noir De Noir goes on strong, perhaps too strong. I'm not sure whether I like it at that early stage, though it has garnered a compliment. It quickly quiets down into a calmer, quality fragrance, that walks the line between sexy and warm/friendly.

Unfortunately, it continues to fade at quite a rate, all but disappearing by the 3 hour mark. What a shame. If it held for longer it might be full bottle worthy. Still, it's a good option for first dates."

The rose mixed with patchouli, tuber, oud, saffron and a hint of oakmoss is blended so well. Somehow reminds me of black tea with some added spices. Though I do believe it is of acquired taste. You won't please the masses, but will definitely impress someone who is interested in fragrances. Also, it projects and lasts for a very long time on my skin, 10+ hours. That is very rare, as most fragrances die out on my skin faster than on other people. So NdN is a definite winner. Do sample it, too bad it's expensive as hell (and it does smell expensive)."

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Tom ford should’ve discontinued this one a long time ago it’s not worth Being in the private blend
What makes matters worse is that one of the cheapest fragrances in the market has a exact smell which makes buying this one a bad decision
I guess even Tom ford can screw up sometimes"
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","If you are a fan of 4711 or Jean Marie Farina (by Roger & Gallet), you will mostly likely enjoy this frag. Fresh/ invigorating/ citrus-herbal-aromatic take on the ""kolnisch wasser"" genre, this one is quite nice.

It is amplified chic, per Tom Ford, as housed in an aqua square bottle. A great day fragrance, and considerably overpriced and over-hyped. But if you don't mind that, this is certainly enjoyable."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I've tried this fragrance a few times at TF counter. I love its neroli scent, just that it doesn't fit myself too well.

I tried it on my arms with a few sprays, at first the citrus scent was so splashing and sparklingly refreshing, thought it's gonna be a strong scent that lasts long, but then the freshness faded away quickly. The scent then turned into a mild soapy scent- not a cheap soap bar though- it's more of a high-end hotel kind of spa soap, naturally cold-pressed, with amber and musk undertone.

If Fleur de Portofino smells like roaming around a Mediterranean garden in a sunny summer day, I'd say Neroli Portofino smells more like watching summer sunset at an Italian Riviera luxury resort lounge/ balcony, with white candles lit little by little...

Longevity seems unexpectedly weak, I could hardly smell any scent left on my arms after 2-3 hours. I wouldn't say it's overpriced if it lasted longer. I also find it leaning more towards the “masculine” side (but who cares anyway it’s 2021 right)."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","In the opening it is lemon. Like a realistic one. Like a chef in his outside kitchen in Italy cooking up a recipe and chipping up lemons in front of a TV crew. There is a hint of moth balls that I don't like.

On the dry down I smell more green notes like green leaves. It turns into a different kind of smell. Laundry. Like fresh laundry in the green British countryside. I can then smell the lavender in the background which is great as I'm looking for a Sleep perfume."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","It's perfect. They took 4711 and made it useable. If only it lasted more than 2-3 hours and cost half as much... It's such a tough call. I could wear Neroli Portofino every single day in the spring and summer, and I don't mind spending coin on a good bottle, but with performance this poor I feel like a sucker. I've owned BMW's in the past, and will never again. Same deal. The cost of ownership is too high.

If anyone is reading this and finds mention of the Just Jack clone of Neroli Portofino, avoid it at all costs. It's trash. I'm no snob and own plenty of clones. But in my quest to find 4711 but long lasting and affordable, I found the Just Jack clone smells like if you went and took a whiff of a floral shop's outdoor trash dumpster on a hot summer day. There is a sharp burning plastic note that is so offensive. What I believe they are intending with the neroli note smells so sharp and so synthetic it comes off as burning rubber, burning plastic, etc. Unwearable garbage. Once I use up my 10ml decant of NP I'll just buy a 100ml like a sucker. Ferrari Bright Neroli is a wonderful alternative but has become discontinued. There's that Ferragamo neroli scent that is decent but has a bit too much modern men's fruit boot aquatic body wash in there for my taste.

Also, if you want to suffer this pain for yourself, I have a 50ml bottle of the Just Jack Neroli hot garbage juice up for grabs. Get it while it's hot!"
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Neroli Portofino is a beautifully blended, high-quality fragrance that invokes the sensation of walking through nature on a hot summer's day in a Mediterranean country. As all amazing fragrances do, Neroli Portofino takes you somewhere else as soon as you spray it. It opens with bright, juicy citruses, floral, orangy neroli, and some mintiness from the myrtle. As it dries down, the citruses subside a bit, and you get beautifully blended white florals coming through, especially the neroli. It smells so authentic, just like what you'd smell on a walk through flowery tracks in a hot country. Throughout, you get the musk giving the fragrance an alluring edge, and the amber which becomes more prominent as the scent dries down, and gives it a slight, comforting warmth. There's also a nice, subtle bitterness in the dry down which I think is the angelica, which makes it even more interesting. Performance is moderate, but for a summery, lighter fragrance, that's okay.

As amazingly high-quality and evocative as this fragrance is, I've always struggled to justify the price of niche, summer fragrances. With niche fragrances more aimed at colder weather, there's so much opportunity to use dark, interesting, loud notes, above and beyond what's used in designer fragrances, and that for me justifies the price increase. With lighter, more summery niche fragrances, it's difficult to add more interesting, deeper, richer accords, as they make a fragrance too heavy and it loses the light, citrusy vibes. So even though this fragrance is beautiful, and definitely a bit more interesting than summer designer fragrances, I'm not sure it's different enough to justify the price, whereas I'd have no problem spending the money on the heavier, more wintery Tom Fords. I also prefer more masculine-leaning fragrances, and this is decidedly unisex.

If money is no object, you love fragrance, and have a special holiday or occasion in the summer, this would be the perfect investment to create beautiful scent memories. But for me, I'm yet to find a niche, summery fragrance that justifies the price. Still an amazing fragrance, though."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I swear I smell patchouli in this. Maybe that's the musk mallow? Angelica? I think I can ID a musky scent pretty well, but I seriously get patchouli coming out in this. It makes it masculine, but it seems uninventive to me for TF. As I've mentioned in other TF reviews, I've been a fan of his a long time (since the Gucci bags in my hs and college days), and I know his genius. Neroli Portofino seems lazy for his ability, IMHO.

I'm a neroli lover, so I flock to the scent in any fragrance. One of my go-tos is JM's Basil Neroli, which I adore for its simplicity, and it is much more feminine than TF's version. Creed's Neroli Sauvage is nice, but leans a little masculine for me (as a woman wanting to wear it), though still not as masculine as TF NP. Other Nerolis, like 4711 Original, are classics for a reason, and great everyday colognes. That said, I see how TF is trying to make something stand-out, and special here, moreso than the ""safe"" standy-bys, but it just doesn't do it for me. And I mean that not only as a woman who wants to wear it, but also as a woman who can rate based on how much I'd enjoy it on a man. I just wouldn't. So many better TF options, or Neroli (non-TF) options to choose from."

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","It spells like a sunny day in the park, in Italy, France, or some small country side town - whilst wearing a clean white shirt.

The Neroli dominates all the other notes, it's gives a white floral mood. But doesn't last, the dry down is weak."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Neroli straight and simple. I find it too much neroli in pureness and is annoying to me, too intense. I prefer neroli more blended and not dominant. 3/5 only for neroli lovers."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Have you ever been to Sicily in spring? I have been and I had the most marvelous real-life sniffing experience in Cefalu, a lovely small ancient town on the North eastern coast of Sicily, half an hour away from Palermo.
I went there by train, and the minute I set my foot out of the train that led me there, I thought: I wanna live in a place like that. The air was scented, the scent had the same intensity you would smell in a room/close space scented by a human hand.
In Cefalu it was the Nature, and the scent invading the air was Orange Blossom, from the trees that were blossoming all over (even at the train station - where notoriously the smell is not the best!). That was like free aromatherapy! I felt happy smelling that finely scented air.
That long story to say that Tom Ford Neroli Portofino smells really like that perfumed air I smelled in Sicily...
It is exactly like the real thing. (OK, TF said in the name it would be the Portofino orange blossom, not the sicilian one, but it's the real thing believe me).
Pure orange blossom.... a little jasmine... it is quite linear from beginning to end; has a warm vanillic/amber base, that is never interfering with the Orange Blossom, but giving some intensity.
Moderate sillage. But the lasting power is disatrous.
Way too expensive to spritz every hour or so... However, great for daywear in spring summer.
Makes you feel happy.... really a mood lifter.
Similar vibe in the very unpretentious but inexpensive Cologne 4711, and I found an almost exact dupe in Zara Amalfi Sunrise (by Jo Malone)."

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I cannot believe how lovely this is! Soft, warm and conforming, smells like a spa.
I also think it’s way overpriced, because it is the kind of scent you would usually find at Rituals."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","This is lovely stuff. I got this on sale at Nordstrom, so it wasn't as harmful to the wallet as it would normally be.
I don't live anywhere near where 4711 is commonly used and nobody I know has ever heard of it, in any age range, so I have no associations for this scent other than knowing it is quite similar to 4711. It IS similar, but has a cottony laundry musk in the drydown that wafts up pleasantly. Luxe dryer sheets, almost.
Really, it's a gorgeous, delicate, sparkling neroli, that weaves in and out of being sweet and dry. Think Brian Krakow in My So-Called Life commenting on the ""orange grove"" smell of Angela's hair - that kind of thing.
Performance is bad, but if you want to feel chic and wealthy, this is a lovely fragrance."

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","The first western fragrance I've approached after a year of strong Arabian fragrances. I guess it's for that reason that I felt a little underwhelmed by NP after reading all the rave reviews. It's an elegant scent, very lovely, but subtle and I didn't find it particularly unique. To spend half the price and justify all the attention I expected a knock out.

Good thing, in the end. Won't be tempted to throw money at it."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","A drier 4711, less sweet, less herbal, with twice the lasting power...
...which means twenty minutes rather than ten.

The orange flower is lovely, but it gets eaten up by the bergamot pretty quickly. I like the amber at the bottom--it roughs up the jasmine, but the rosemary and lavender don't have the freshness of the basil.

If I were stupid rich, I might buy a bottle, but tried and true and cheap suits broke me just fine."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I don't know why so many rate it for a warmer weather rather than cold, when it could be in truth for both warm and colder days.... anyway, i f love this. when i first sniffed it wasn't expecting anything much but i was aware that tom ford creates these amazing blends so it is either a hit or miss because i have a picky nose and this for sure is a hit. it is savoury and you immediately want to be somewhere else and that is why i would recommend to wear it in colder weather too like if you need some type of a perfume that would remind you of those niceee days or just a warmer day. and once i got away from that bottle i knew i had to get back to it (once i get enough income, like seriously kinda expensive), it really lingers there up in your nose or close to your nose because let us be honest you have not smelt anything like this which is a summer warmer days fragrance. if you want to stand out from the crowd then this is the one and also if you want to feel better and fresh this is the one and if you wnat something absolutely mind blowing just for yourself this is really that one because it doesn't have that specific tf dna in it yet it does so if you are not a big fan of other tom ford famous blends then you might actually love this.
anyway this absolute summer not so fresh but more savoury perfume will be in your collection for years because i doubt that there will be anything like that."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","This is really nice. Smells very juicy, quite effervescent, and really pops off the skin. This is overshadowed by the performance, it is close to the skin and lasts about 6 hours at max.

The scent is amazing, just wish it lasted longer."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I was sure I was going to love this. I thought I had found MY summer fragrance. It's not unisex.

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Very clean smelling and makes me happy. It smells, in my opinion, similar to Mugler Mugler cologne but to the next level. Like the mugler cologne was fresher and even more clean then it smells. Also reminds me of Jean Nate body splash my mom used to put on after a shower lol. Not a bad thing but just what it reminds me of. Good for the summer or daytime but is so clean smelling and light that you can pretty much wear it whenever. The smell lasted but does not project much even after a few minutes of putting it on. I think this fragrance is not meant to be big on projection and is a subtle fragrance. Expensive but it is a nice scent and if it makes you happy purchase it, I don’t regret it at all."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Tom Ford frustrates me with the crazy price points (consider the expensive fucking fabulous) but more so with the fact that he always makes me dip into my pocket because he curates a collection of smells that nobody else does and few do better.

Neroli Portofino is a case in point. Of the myriad colognes that exist, few have the wow factor, and even fewer pass the repeat desire to sniff your elbow crease. Ive tried many, from Parma, to Malle, from big houses to Heeley. This is the one i keep coming back to and shelling out for.

Does it last? nope. Is it overpriced? yes.

But for the time it does last does it smell great? does it make you feel good? do you get a kick out of wearing it? does it brighten a day? all yes for me.

We can analyse the components, argue about sillage and staying power etc, But for me it comes to a simple binary. It is as ""transportative"" as the marketing blurb says. And it is the finest smelling cologne out there and has been for years.

Which is why suckers like me keep paying over the odds for it.

Yep, the Texan is a frustrating man indeed..."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Orange and bergamot, a little spicy, a little jasmine and a hint of amber.... It is an ok citrate perfume, but it's enough to worth 260-320 euros? It's simple, it's clean, but there are better and more resistant versions on the skin from brands that don't have such prices. Rather than give so much on this perfume I better put a difference of 200 and take a Rubeus Milano, and I know it's high-class Italian perfume with a complex formula and scent. I find it silly to give so much on an absolutely banal perfume just because Tom Ford writes on it. No one was born as a baby smelling of Tom Ford, and yes, by the way this scent smells like baby powder topfer orange.
For those who do not want to lose so much money, I recommend Night Obsession, which is very similar but goes easily to the oriental perfumes, Fraiche from Vanilla Grace just a little sweater than this, and very very similar is Splendid Orange Blossom by Angel Schlesser or Marino and also Angel S. has four other gorgeous citrus perfumes in their collection. Conclusion: good, relaxing, summer scent, very orange and a little spicy but a very low resistance and at this price...I say no."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","This scent is lovely and very inoffensive. Fresh, splashy neroli and bergamot. Great hot weather fragrance. Delightful.

So-so longevity, which in my experience is normal for this kind of fragrance. I wouldn't hold that against it...if it weren't $250 for 50mL!! You'll go through this so fast.

If you love that big citrus burst at the beginning definitely start with 4711, maybe layer it with something. It's so cheap that it's worth experimenting a bit.

Personally I don't find this unique or long-lasting enough to justify the price. You're paying for the brand name here."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","It's so funny to me how as an adult I'm mostly attracted to more expensive versions of botanica perfumes. This is expensive 4711 with more longevity & nuance. It starts strong, and goes powdery. It also reminds me of high fashion florida water. It seems like it's meant to be a refresher fragrance for hot weather. I would not buy a whole bottle of this. I'd probably buy a huge bottle of 4711 & carry around a decanted sprayer so I could refresh during the day."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","It was winter when I was in mall and tested Neroli Portofino. The mall area was warm and cosy, I sprayed the perfume and it made me feel like I just travelled back to summer.

Perfume is literally blooming, it's clean like white colour. On my skin it was jasmine, neroli and some plant I am not familar with. It's absolutely floral on me. I was inhaling aromatherapic scent all the way towards exit and calculating in mind if I can someday afford this piece.

The moment I crossed the door to damp rainy chill evening and my summer fields melted away like a nice dream and I was left with some sharp, biting lemon cologne that wasn't even close to what I experienced seconds ago. This is only warm/hot weather product, no grace or beauty in cold."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I've long wanted to get my hands on Tom Ford's Neroli Portofino and having lived in Liguria I decided it was well overdue.

Neroli Portofino is beautifully blended. It's smooth and is a perfume which embraces you. The initial blast is a load of oranges and lemons with a hint of amber, jasmine and white florals (of which it is difficult to pick out any individual note other than the jasmine) and a hint of lavender.

It projects moderately for about two hours before settling down to a skin scent afterwards. It's easily detectable on the skin for four and a half hours before fading away a little after five hours.

Neroli Portofino a lovely high quality perfume and the bottle is gorgeous. But ... that price ... it's so expensive for a perfume that isn't long lasting. I'd be delighted to receive it as a gift but I couldn't buy any more at the price. However, I would suggest treating yourself to a sample.

Nicely done neroli."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Yep, the longevity really sucks. So I just decanted some into a 12ml atomizer. I'm not usually a citrus fan, but it's great on a hot, 32-degree C day on the Canadian West Coast. But honestly, I don't think I'd recommend this. This scent was obviously made for hot weather. But I like fragrances that are thicker and heavier than this. I have 3 other Private Blends that are miles better. This 50ml bottle will last me the rest of my life, probably after. It's good, but not amazing. Didn't think I'd be saying this about a PB."

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']",This is very lovely and it’s essentially the summer version of Angelique Noir from Guerlain.
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Tom Ford Neroli Portofino opens with a moderate projection of citrus and white floral notes. The lemon and the bergamot are the most prominent citrus note and they are very zesty, slightly musky, and sour, evocative of pure lemon juice. The floral accords come across as white flowers and are not as strong as the citrus accords. The rosemary note is very faint and doesn’t add much to the scent. The initial projection drops quickly from moderate to low. As Tom Ford Neroli Portofino dries down, the ambrette and angelica enter the blend enhancing the citrus and floral notes, and adding a mild musky tone that improves projection. The amber adds a mildly powdery touch. The most noticeable opening to a dry-down change in this fragrance is the citrus lemon opening to a musky and powdery dry-down. Once the Tom Ford Neroli Portofino has reached is full dry-down, it can be summarized as a moderate to low projection, musky, slightly powdery, white floral, and citrus fragrance with some spicy accords. The fragrance feels fresh, classy, summery, unisex, musky powdery, faint, diurnal, mature, and relatively pleasant.

BATCH REVIEWED: 2020
WOW RATING: 5/10. A musky citrusy floral fragrance, it feels average.
DISLIKE RATING: 1/10. It is unlikely that this fragrance will be offensive to anyone.
UNIQUENESS: 3/10. The notes in this fragrance are very common.
MASS APPEAL: 5/10. This is not the most mass-appeal fragrances.
PROJECTION: 2/10. Low, about 2 feet around the wearer.
SILLAGE: 2/10. Low, about 2 feet behind the wearer.
APPLICATION: 4 or more atomizations.
LONGEVITY: 3/10. Low, about 3 hours, with very low projection.
SEASONS: Spring and summer.
OCCASIONS: Formal events, outdoor gatherings, gym, office, business, casual. This is an office-friendly fragrance.
VERSATILITY: 8/10. As most citrus-based fragrances, Tom Ford Neroli Portofino is versatile.
GENDER: Advertised as unisex, the white floral accords create a slight tilt to the feminine side.
AGES: 30 and above.
RECOMMENDATION: With a discounted price of over $200, Tom Ford Neroli Portofino does not deliver the performance and uniqueness that would be required to meet its price. It is a pleasant fragrance, a nice-to-have but not a must-have.
BLIND-BUY: No, sample it first. The lemony, floral, and musky tones slightly lean the fragrance to the feminine side.
SIMILAR: The following fragrances feature lemony, white floral, and musky tones. Bond No. 9 Texas is a good citrus fragrance with strong white floral notes; Xerjoff Casamorati 1888 is a warm spicy, woody, amber, floral, balsamic, and aromatic fragrance; Acqua Di Parma Men Colonia Essenza features citrus, musky animalic, fresh spicy, and white floral notes; Chanel Les Exclusifs De Chanel Jersey EDP is an aromatic, floral, fresh spicy, vanilla, and musky fragrance; Chanel Les Exclusifs Coromandel EDP brings neroli, woody, warm spicy, patchouli, and sweet tones; Issey Miyake - L'Eau D'Issey Men EDT is citrus, aromatic, fresh spicy, green, and floral fragrance; Ferrari Bright Neroli Men EDT is a soft but pleasant slightly sweet, citrus and white floral fragrance; Roja Parfums Scandal Cologne Parfum features multiple tones, including citrus, floral, and spices.

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Shiny, juicy, watery (powerful I mean evocative of water, not watered down) and surprisingly complete smelling citrus. The rosemary is also intense. They don’t sit apart independently per se but I wouldn’t call it blended either it’s as if the oils sat beside each other just blending at the edges. the jasmine is indolic and can make it heady, but I wouldn’t immediately say “that’s distinctly jasmine” or floral. I’d say this, Hermes, with citron noir and pompelmouse rose, and clementine California by atelier cologne are some of the only fragrances that have extracted so many qualities of a cuties I feel as if I’m holding one in my hands."

I have (very briefly) owned Ferrari BN.
I have sniffed the ALDI clone recently.
The ALDI clone did smell somewhat the same as TFNP (although having only sniffed it once I can't say how close it is).
I found absolutely no resemblance between Ferrari BN and either TFNP or the ALDI clone, none whatsoever. I fail to see how they can ever be compared. The Ferrari smells fusty and old school with not zesty, semi-sweet citrus, just the contents of an old ladies handbag (all respect to old ladies, whom I am very fond).
The TF and ALDI were bright, zesty and semi-sweet and not at all old school or fusty.
Did I have a bad bottle of Ferrari?

To my nose, this smells almost identical to Clean Reserve Aqcua Neroli, but I actually prefer that one since it is not as sharp. It also isn't as bougie, so if that matters to you, go with Tom Ford I guess. There are better neroli scents out there that you could buy twice for the price of one of these."

Although fresh, it’s got a really nice depth to it that makes its so comforting. Obviously a warm weather fragrance, or fresh out of the shower scent. I get 4 hours longevity and soft-medium projection for the first 1-2 hours with 5 sprays to the chest. Some may argue that the longevity is not worth it but the scent is so good that I don’t mind respraying – obviously that doesn’t mean I like the longevity rating. Some would also say there are clones out there with better performance, but personally, I’m not a fan of clones. If you like the scent, which I can almost guarantee you will, I say buy a full bottle.

My most used fragrance for the summer of 2019.
I spray it on me and I feel fresh luxurious and ready for the summer day.
A warm evening and you are ready for dinner with friends TF Neroli Portofino is great.

People don’t always tell you “ah you smell goood!!” but everyone I asked thinks TFNP is awesome.

Would a buy it again? YES.

I hoped that it would last longer on my skin than it does. that is the only negative I can say about this fragrance.

I love Tom Ford and adore Neroli so I thought I had found my 'forever' perfume. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out quite like that. The neroli starts off strong - then fades into a dreadful, old-lady powdery musk - and finally, I was left with a sickening artificial vanilla.

I also completely understand that every perfume reacts differently so I was just unlucky. I'm also on quite a bit of medication so I'm wondering if that had something to do with it. Well, onwards and upwards and still seeking my FP."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I’d like to make a recommendation to people who absolutely love the neroli in this fragrance but maybe don’t want to spend the money for this one because of the price or the poor longevity. Van Cleef & Arpel California Reverie has the same beautiful neroli and natural feeling that this fragrance has. It’s also got the same sort of clean modern “non perfume” vibe that this fragrance has. I own both fragrance and I have to say that California Reverie is just as uplifting, fresh, and gorgeous as NP. I’m not saying that they are dupes, at all. They aren’t but if I smelled CR juice in a Tom Ford bottle I’d have no problem believing that it was one of Tom Ford’s fragrances. The neroli in CR smells like Neroli Portofino in quality. It’s also quite unisex even though the notes look like they might be more feminine I find that it would be good for anyone."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Soap from ultra, hyper, mega luxury bathrooms, like millionaire people buy for their bathroom and by just leaving it on the sink it perfumes beautifully the whole environment (and that the poor visitor puts in his pocket to take home). To fans of soap, if asked ""where is your God now?"", Tom Ford replies with Neroli Portofino: here is our God. I am sure that if there is a bathroom in paradise, the predominant smell in it will be this. It is so above all other soaps that it is able to please even those who do not like the genre (like me) - this is the level of excellence soapness here. After spraying, where I turn my nose I feel this carnival of very fragrant fruity flowers of an absurdly high level of quality and harmonic nuances. Speaking of God and paradise, I have faith that it is a sin to speak of ""citrus"" here: there is no acidity in the fragrance, despite those 4 fruits cited by the house market, but if it's necessary to point some fruit here, the most notable of which are certainly tangerine and orange. Very strong performance, it projects a whole meter for 3 hours and only then decelerates to 5cms for another eternity."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","citrus and flowers draped over a boozy, ambery foundation that is the typical TFPB DNA.

Imagine drinking tequila sunrises/palomas made w fresh squeezed citrus (grapefruit, lemon, orange, mandarin)and the finest blanco tequila on the deck of a sleek yacht. youre wearing a thin layer of sunscreen, a gently setting sun causes the occasional shimmer on the calm still ocean."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","As the packaging, and name of this perfume would suggest, TF’s Neroli Portofino would serve as an excellent summer fragrance and definitely more upon the masculine side - the bitter orange and something I can’t quite put my finger on make this smell like a ‘brighter, fruitier’ AdP Essenza Colonia with just enough Amber to keep things ‘smooth’ without being cloying...

Neroli Portofino has just enough projection to keep its summer song within olfactory reach but doesn’t stick in the nose and whilst it is a fragrance that smells rich and expensive, smooth and complex... it only gets a ‘Like’ not a ‘Love.’ It’s lacks a certain spark which I’ve found in AdP Essenza and Chanel Allure Sport that both entice and inspire."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Last year this became one of my mainstays for summer days at work. Light and fresh - starts off smelling like 4711 - but then dries down into a more rich and complex scent, whilst keeping the fresh citrus smell.

It's fresh, it's light, it's warm.....it's everything I want in a summer fragrance."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']",I've been wearing this perfume since it's launch in 2011. I can't get away from it... I never will.
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I got a bottle based on all the amazing reviews of this perfume and it turned out to be a big disappointment. I expected the fresh citrus which almost everybody is enjoying, but unfortunately it smells like detergent to my nose(dare I say toilet cleaner). It must be just me, as when I offered a sniff to people around me everybody loved it. I am starting to think that Tom Ford perfumes just aren't for me, as much as I wanted to love them!"

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","This is a beautiful fragrance and one of my all time favourites. The citrus notes of orange and bergamot make this a perfect daytime fragrance, particularly for a warm summers day. The fragrance is a little expensive, which I do not mind paying in return for great longevity and sillage. This perfume unfortunately lacks both, therefore making it difficult for me to justify the price. An amazing scent nonetheless."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","For me. this is a perfect frag for ONLY summer daytime. ANd it is GREAT for that. It also doesnt last super long- which I think is a good thing for the only time of day I wear it. (I cant switch scents for night time)


If you have an arsenal of frags... I recommend but if you do not- stay far away."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Love this stuff since first sniff - bright citrus, heady white flower, a bit of glowy warmth in the base - right up my alley. It's very pure and smooth for its domain, the sort of way that Grey Goose is very pure and smooth as vodka goes. Indeed, it is a bit soapy, which to me is much of its allure - I like smelling clean. It's lovely on my skin, like I've just stepped out into the warm afternoon sun after a quick shower following the most amazing nap in a big, plush bed at an oceanside resort, windows wide open and white curtains billowing in the fresh sea breeze. And the bottle is beautiful, essentially a functional art piece that not only reflects and enhances the character of its contents but is a pleasure to use, being heavy, satisfying to the touch, easy to open and spray. I've checked out the recent flankers - Forte, Fleur - but they don't outplay the simple beauty of this original. Neroli Portofino got it all right on this one -

Except, of course, the barely-there longevity for the very-there price. I can maybe justify dropping the $128 on that 50ml bottle of Velvet Orchid, which is a potent, unique beauty indeed, but even though I have arguably more love for Neroli Portofino, heck no I'm not going to purchase it. Because while Velvet Orchid has few cousins, NP's soapy citrus + white floral is happily a pretty popular fragrance theme. Here are some economic alternatives: 4711 Echt Kölnisch Wasser (classic, pleasant bottle, doesn't last either but you can buy 10 times the amount for the same price); Clean Reserve Acqua Neroli (eco-friendly and health-friendly); Burberry London (jasmine instead of neroli, but a similar fresh-clean vibe and better longevity); Acqua di Parma (switching out the sharper neroli for a softer barbershoppy lavender); Armani Code for Her (similar with a dose of warm honey).

In conclusion, Neroli Portofino is lovely, but unless it's your perfume OTP I think there are a lot of other fish in the warm Mediterranean sea!"

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Overall, it smells similar a generic soap bar easily found anywhere. I think it's Ivory soap? Not sure.

But there's still a level of complexity that makes it worth wearing and enjoyable. It's clean and likable. However, it's not worth its full price in my opinion--especially with its performance. At the price point, there are many other alternatives that are more adventurous (in a good way).

I prefer its cousin TF Mandarino di Amalfi much more. The Forte version of this fixes some performance problems, but it dials up the generic soap-like qualities even more.

I say this now, but likely will buy a bottle at some point at the right price. The bottle's color is a gorgeous color that looked just like the waters of Capri/Sorrento, Italy (near Portofino) when I visited in May 2019.

6/10 scent, 4/10 longevity usually (sometimes 6), 5/10 sillage. Year-round. Worth trying."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","This does smell very like 4711, eau de cologne, or the generic “agua de Colonia” that can be bought very cheaply by the litre in any Spanish supermarket.
That said, I love all of the above, so Neroli Portofino is a love for me.
The important difference is that Neroli Portofino has a more refined & sophisticated edge with much better longevity. Whether that makes it worth the hefty price tag is open to debate.
It’s super clean and fresh, giving you that “straight from the shower” smell. The uplifting Mediterranean vibe makes it a perfect choice for hot summer days and I always take it on vacations to warmer climes."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Neroli Portofino is a refreshing citrus white floral.

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I recently purchased this and just in love with it. I have been using Ferrari’s Bright Neroli for more than a year now but this Neroli Portofino by Tom ford is a whole other level. I don’t know why people compare the 2 fragrances ? I mean, I love Ferrari’s Bright Neroli but the 2 are not exactly the same or even give the same vibe. These 2 are on a level of their own. Tom Ford is rather creamy very natural Neroli whereas the Price cut can be smelt in Bright Neroli. Now I’m not saying that BN smells like shit. It is far from that and way above my other high end branded fragrances. What I mean to say is, Bright Neroli and Neroli Portofino are 2 different fragrances that give different vibes. One is creamy (TF) whereas the other is astringent and very citrusy (BN).
I love both of them but Neroli Portofino shows it’s class. I know there are performances issues which we don’t expect to get after paying such hefty price for a bottle but can’t do anything about it.
Pure quality but sadly doesn’t last."

I bought Mandarino di Amalfi and now I own Neroli Portofino too. As other reviewers wrote the only complain here is the longevity.

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I have been a hard-core fan of Neroli Portofino since five years and gone through two 50 ml bottles EdP and one 100 ml of the Acqua version.
Neroli Portofino really is a beautiful summer scent but as many have said here before, it is a super concentrated version of 4711.

I live in Germany where 4711 is a staple in peoples bathrooms. On the few ocations I do get some comments on this scent, people always think it is 4711.
That is not fun when you spent lots of cash on a bottle.

With that said, yes it’s a beautiful and refreshing perfume. But I have now moved on to Mandarino di Amalfi which is much more complex and interesting."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Let me get this out of the way: longevity sucks. So too does projection.

Now ordinarily, this would put me off buying a fragrance. However, this isn't any 'ordinary' fragrance. This has to be the best citrus/orange blossom fragrance going.

Orange blossom is the main player here and it's beautiful. Secondly i get the mandarin/bergamot punch but also the rosemary, which I love. The harmony between these notes is perfect. No other word for it. There are no base notes, at least I don't detect any. This isn't a problem for me though.

Sometimes we get bogged down in a fragrance's staying power but sometimes you just have to sit back and admire the perfumer's creativity and skill. This is an absolute delight. Tom Ford uses the adjective 'transportive' for this fragrance and that's exactly what it is. It's that perfect summer holiday, with a drink in your hand and the sun on your face. It's an escape from your everyday life and sadly before you know it, it's over. You're sad but then if it had lasted forever, would you have appreciated it as much?"
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","The smoothest blend of Neroli and Citrus I have tried to date, simply superb.

The balance on this is unmatched in the genre in my opinion (though I have yet to try NP Forte) and yes that includes Xerjoff Nio which is also incredible but leans more to sharper but juicy bergamot than this does.

It is not particularly unique or daring as there are tons of frags you could choose in this genre but longevity aside I think anything you would choose instead would be a step down in blend if you just wanted the perfect balance between those two main themes.

The only complaint is the same as everyone else, it is light and somewhat weak. That can be a plus in some circumstances (the office for eg.) but as I think this is designed for heat/warm weather wearing I’m not sure it is a plus point here. Hopefully NP Forte does a better job of this without altering the blend.

Still, this one’s a love. It just feels so damn good to smell it for the time it’s around."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","This fragrance takes me back to the time I was in Lake Como with George Clooney. We cruised through Sorrento when the peonia were in full bloom and picked some fresh blood oranges at the side of the road. The sun was in my hair, and the air was resonant with the evergreen crispness of Tuscan cypress. We stopped at a sidewalk cafe, and I enjoyed a Limoncello spritzer while George signed autographs. I excused myself to go to the ladies' room where they had the most expensive little soaps imaginable... I slipped one into my Gucci handbag when no one was looking. Except none of this happened... BUT wearing this scent, I believe it COULD HAVE. It takes me to Italy every time I spray it. I wish the projection was better, but its the perfect Summer fragrance. Magnifico, Tom Ford! Ciao!"
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']",This smells like a dream. I have never smelt any floral so pretty. It's fresh but creamy and intoxicating in summer heat. Absolute love.
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","This is a great scent. Has a fruity, floral, soapy, citrusy aquatic vibe.

I really like this one but the performance is too bad to ignore.

I've gotten as little as an hour or 2 with this fragrance with almost zero projection. Have to dig my nose into my skin to smell it (half an hour or so after applying).

I have no problem reapplying poor performing fragrances in the middle of the day, but I'd be reapplying this every couple hours.

Again, great scent, absolutely unacceptable performance given the price tag.

SCORE: 1 out of 5 ⭐"
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","This is one I used to dislike, but after trying it on for full wearings as of late, I can say that I like it a lot. The smell of neroli here is so invigorating and authentic, and sweetens up as it continues to dry down. It's funny, because it gives off a pistachio accord, and starts to remind me of Arabic sweets like knafa. Neroli tends to do that to my nose. This would be a perfect fragrance to wear if you your Arab friends happen to invite you over for tea during Ramadan. As lovely as it smells though, I don't think Neroli Portofino is worthy of the hefty price tag. It's too weak, and isn't that unique. Of course, the quality is there with any of Tom Ford's fragrances, but I can't justify a full bottle of this. It would be smarter to get a small decant for a decent price."

At the time I had totally lost the scent of the fragrance game. I decided to buy myself a fragrance after years. Maybe because my ex-employer was such a scummy fellow I needed to comfort my senses. Now if it was a 100 bucks I would have raised and seen the cards. But it was 180 for 50ml. Still...

...to me it smelled so good I got memories of things I had never done. (like Total Recall) So I said to myself that I would definitely splash out and buy it another time.

In the mean time I got back on track of the game and kept hearing/reading comments about better(affordable) alternatives. Well, I will try them all and draw my own conclusion. (got more allowance now anyway)

I also read a few negative comments but to me Neroli Portofino smells imperial, maybe even DIVINE. If Tom is robbing us, I really hope those comments about 4711 and Alexandra are true...

Why would one in his right mind pay $300 for a barbershop scent?! For a cheap, aftershave scent?!

It is sharp & citrusy. Scent-wise, there are abundance of citrus-themed fragrances that are way superior smell-wise to TF-NP. Young people who are less than 30yrs old might find this literally repulsive, espsecially females. TF managed to copy/make a repulsive citrus smell. That's a rare feat.

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Neroli Portofino is a classic. Of course many will consider it overpriced because of the similarity with 4711 Cologne, whilst others would swear by it and not change it for any other cologne. Because let's be real, Neroli Portofino, despite being edp is a cologne type of fragrance, which many other brands such as Givenchy, Chanel, Rochas, Guerlain etc have in their arsenal either in edc or edt, also quite highly priced.

Herbal and botanical and with a pronounced lemon note and a white floral undercurrent. The floral sweetness of neroli is very well present with its steam-like effect, like a shot of hot ironing. Dry, unisex, natural smelling and quiet, calming. Pairs well with any style really, but seems more appropriate for day-wear, could work as a formal or casual and for all ages. Spring and summer are the seasons for it

People seem to confuse lasting power with sillage; and when they stop smelling a perfume from some sort of distance they consider valid, they deem that the perfume's lasting power is also little to no existent. Which is not always the case. Neroli Portofino does sit close to the skin after the first hour, and stays put for at least five hours, which is more than enough for a cologney scent"

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Very nice fragrance, with that characteristic Tom Ford power, if you know what i mean. But, it is not very original. Sure, one can smell the difference in quality between Neroli Portfino and similar perfumes out there, but we are not getting anything new.
Because of this, i don’t have much to say. Buy it if you love strong and natural smelling neroli and orange blossom and if you have the money, but do not expect anything surprising."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Ok, serious question: Why does anyone buy this? I'm not saying it's bad - it's an upscale version of the classic Kölnischwasser (now 4711 Original Eau de Cologne). But therein lies the problem: You could get virtually the same fragrance for less than one tenth of the price.

I'm usually the first one to shake my head at those poor misguided souls who discuss fragrance like they're talking about car insurance (""value for money"") - but 300€ for what is blatantly a 10€ perfume? If my clumsy cockerspaniel, intrigued by the smell of citrus and the clicketyclack of my hipster typewriter, jumped onto my desk right now and knocked the two unlabelled blotters off, he'd be the only one who could reliably tell them apart any longer.

And yet there's a bewildering number of correspondents in here singing Neroli's praises over the good old 4711. I can offer three theories:
(1) They all have both the same penchant for classic colognes and the keen canine sense of smell as Sniffles.
(2) Those groups of rich middle-eastern tourists I always see blowing thousands of euros on fragrance in the TF boutique spend their time between lavish European city vacations writing Fragrantica reviews (it would certainly explain some of the spelling and grammar around here).
(3) There are people who splurged on Nerolino Portofino, learned afterwards about the cheaper original, and are now trying to rationalise away their expensive mispurchase.

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I wrote a review of Neroli Portofino earlier. One of my favorite scents of all time is 4711, so I did a comparison between 4711 and NP. You can read it below, but the differences are slight. The most important thing is Ford’s creation is creamier, more Amber-and lasts longer. I bought 4711 soap, shower gel and a huge bottle of the cologne which I decanted into spray bottles to try to get myself to smell like this all day, but could not get the scent to last long. Even the old trick of soaking a cotton ball with your scent and hiding it in the bra doesn’t work. I always smelled clean and good, but not like juicy orange blossoms.

I’m going to Hawaii, and athough I intend to stock up on a plumeria fragrance you can only get in Maui, I wanted to smell like 4711/Neroli Portofino on my trip. So I broke down and bought Tom Ford’s $55.00 atomizer from Nordstrom.

I put it on at Nordstrom and once again, it’s lovely and has lasted all the rest of the day on me. I can smell it now, in bed. Neroli Portofino is not an exact replica of 4711, as I said if my review, but it’s close enough. So again, I’ll shower gel, splash with 4711, then use my atomizer of NP and I should get the fragrance I want all day as I sit under the Hawaiian sun.

It’s sad to be addicted to something so expensive. If I was a one or two fragrance girl, I could justify the price. But I have over a hundred bottles so adding a $300/600 frag is just impossible as I know I won’t stop trying new ones. My little atomizer will be a treat. Just an idea for you Neroli Portofino lovers out there."

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I can't believe this is not a more popular fragrance given the success of neroli portofino and also Jasmin Rouge. It's like a combination of the two where the sharpness of the neroli is cushioned by the soothing embrace of the Jasmine's white floral tea notes. In neroli portofino forte I find that it has a horrible artificial citrus smell, and fades down to a skin scent in a couple of hours. I think this has better performance although is not incredible but with NPF I feel I have to wait for the citrus to subside before I get the pure neroli scent and then it's gone. A small window of opportunity to enjoy it. With this I instantly smell the neroli and the soft jasmine and the two work better than other neroli frags I've tried although I love adps essenza di colonia but with nb the neroli takes centre stage. I've started wearing it before going to bed as for me the combination of neroli with the tea like notes of the jasmine is incredibly calming."

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","This fragrance was a love at first sniff for me. I’m a sucker for Neroli and Orange Blossom so I just can’t help myself. It’s definitely a happy, charming white floral fragrance. It’s also calming due to the lavender and amber. It’s one of the most natural fragrances (sometimes we have the strangest experiences… plastic? couldn’t be further from the truth to my nose, but we all smell differently). The natural nature of this perfume is of the same vein as Acqua di Parma Colonia. There is the beautiful citrus note that blends so well with the neroli and orange blossom. It’s not a loud fragrance. There is the slight herbal note of soothing lavender and uplifting rosemary along with angelica with the quiet sensual amber grounding all of it. The balance of this fragrance is perfect. It’s gentle and ethereal enveloping the skin and the air around you in a cloud of sweet citrus, joyful neroli, soft sweet sensual whispers of amber, relaxing lavender and rosemary… It’s like lying down on the softest puffy mattress after the most perfect summer day spent with someone you’re in love with. Almost like the euphoria you feel after a perfect workout and in the shower, when you’re alive, elated, but relaxed. I’ve been to Portofino Italy and this fragrance captures the mediterranean gorgeousness of that place. It is refreshing, happy, chic, but as many have noted all too brief. Tom Ford is an extremely tasteful human being. I can picture him there in Portofino lounging on a yacht, looking effortlessly stylish, handsome, and smelling this classy. Portofino is a place that you wake up at 10am, have a beautiful brunch by the sea, dress sexy, refined, but also casual, never hurry, and maybe take a cruise on a boat. I spent my honeymoon in Portofino surrounded by the glittering deep azure blue/green sea. This fragrance conjures up the pure bliss of the blossoming orange trees and natural heaven of the sea and culture that I found in Italy. It captures that relaxed beautiful attitude of truly enjoying life. It is effortlessly luxurious and classy. It’s truly a gentle and joyful fragrance. I only wish it would last longer or this would be my signature scent."

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","this is so funny - when i got my first whiff i said to my friend OMG its 4711! She looked like I was crazy but I was so excited. I feel validated that everyone is saying it in here too.

That's my grandmother's perfume & I still buy it for her at a german's specialty shop. Maybe I can convince her to split a bottle of Tom Ford with me ;)"
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Citrus, a watery rubber plastic smell, white floral, maybe some wood. This reminds me of a summer day by the pool; fresh and clean. Strangely, I get a bleachy, comet bathroom cleaner vibe. The citrus is more prominent in the opening. During the dry down it's all watery plastic wood with white floral. While it has different notes NP reminds me of Kenzo Pour Homme in many ways.

Unisex, projection and sillage feel soft from the start but It hung around for a nice eight hours. Maybe its in my head but it felt stronger during the dry down. Not sexy and good for work. A hot weather scent all the way. Composition is nice and interesting. I like the rubbery wet citrus, floral. I see the pool toys baking in the sun as you splash around in the water; sun block, chlorine. Should perform a little better for the price. Bottle looks cool and fits the concept well. Not outstanding but there are definitely worse TF scents out there."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Okay, you guys are being a little bit extra with the ""exactly like 4711"" stuff. Yes, there is a big similarity, but do not forget that 4711 disappears in a few minutes and is pretty cold and bitter and herbaceous, whereas NP lasts at least 5 hours on me and has a thick, warm, creamy mandarin-amber note that 4711 does not have.

I'd compare this to typical generic Turkish lemon cologne ""Kolonya"" before I'd go with 4711 because at least Turkish cologne isn't bitter.

Anyway, I made a huge mistake of layering this over Dior Addict that was almost done with its dry-down after 5-6 hours with only a faint boozy vanilla remaining, so I figured ""what's the harm?"" and the harm is that it turns out mixing this with vanilla becomes a rather cloying tobacco-like experience oddly reminiscent of Tobacco Vanille (Which I'm one of the rare few who hates that perfume, again the tobacco is too cloying for me) so actually since a lot of people like Tobacco Vanille, how about this?:

If you regret your Neroli Portofino purchase, try layering it with whatever feminine spicy vanilla scent you have lying around and see if you can't create something completely different out of it? (but have the soap and washcloth ready, it could turn out to be a disaster!)"
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","All orange, no neroli
I teach kids and they all asked me: “Why does it smell like oranges in here?” Nuff said...at this price? Seriously? Eat oranges."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I'll make this short: it's the exact scent of 4711 Eau de Cologne with better longevity. The scent itself is mesmerizing and spectacular (as is the scent of 4711, upon which this is based). But the longevity is only moderate at around 4-5 hours - which is an improvement to 4711 as that only lasts 2 hours if you're lucky, but it's nothing groundbreaking. And it's way overpriced. If you have the cash, then by all means get Neroli Portofino Forte for something better that lasts even longer. But if you don't want to pay that much, Bond No. 9's Eau de New York is just superior to this in every way and for less money. And the best cheap alternative to Neroli Portofino is Ferrari's Bright Neroli. But if you want something more 'green', then go for Mugler Cologne.

However if you really just want the Neroli Portofino scent to last on you for 8 hours and don't want to keep spritzing 4711 Eau de Cologne in a travel atomizer, then listen to my advice and get the perfume oil version of this for $6 from the Kuwaiti perfume oil company ""Universal Perfume Oils and Cosmetics"" (Google it). It's exactly the same as Neroli Portofino but with better projection and 8 hours longevity. And a 3 ml bottle of the oil should last you ages. You now have knowledge of the best kept secret in perfume buying.

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","The ever-polarising Tom Ford and Rodrigo Flores-Roux present us here, with Clinique Happy's older, bolder, sultrier sister; the sister that causes commotion at family gatherings and just doesn't care.True, this opens with a blast of fancy-hotel-soap, and throws us back to the cologne-dripping lotharios of the '80's, but in dry-down is where this frag shines. The gorgeous blending of the citrus and floral notes is so perfectly done; as it warms on your skin, Neroli Portofino simply sings. To me, it takes me back to the beaches of the Med in summer, to spritzing this beauty on recently wet skin, while watching the sun go down.
Utter bliss.
PS If this frag is outside your price point, its dupe is YSL Saharienne. I've got both, and they're VERY similar."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Neroli Portofino: The Inconvenient Truth:
The note pyramid listed is surely wrong, because for me at least, this has two primary ingredients, so skilfully blended I can't pick them apart: Love and Hate. In a beautiful turquoise bottle.

HATE: the grotesque price. The sometimes pathetic longevity. The hype. The way that on the wrong days it can just randomly turn to straight citrus cleanser on me. How disturbingly like an ordinary cologne or a plain ol' lemon soap it can seem now and then.

But but but....
LOVE: how it becomes something so drop-dead gorgeous on really hot days. Its unique sweet warmth underneath the sparkling freshness. How it makes me feel cool (in every sense), calm and competent. The way it can bloom into the essence of the most expensive Mediterranean luxury holiday I've (n)ever had. The fact that the first instant I ever smelled it I fell in love, and my nose told me -ordered me!- to work and save so I could seek it out, years and years before I knew anything at all about perfume, aeons before going full fraghead.

I read so much here about 4711 I sought that out, but it really is not in the same league, even if you divide by 20 to account for the price. Now THAT, even though hugely refreshing, really is a sharp cleaning product that's gone in minutes. To me it's 4711 that is a pale shadow of TF NP, not the other way around.

I will probably migrate over to Monegal Entre Naranjos, Bigarade Concentree or L'Erbolario or even Ferrari Bright Neroli for my next bottle of something citric... But until then, I'll savour every precious overpriced pretentious drop of Portofino, and will keep that beautiful empty bottle until I die, to remind me of what got me started on this insane lifelong quest for the most wonderful smell in the world. For all its many, many faults and its obnoxious reputation, I owe this scent a massive debt of gratitude. Tom Ford, I don't know whether to thank or curse you for that."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I used a sample today and immediately I get some kind of sunscreen scent, I thought okay it's probably the alcohol and waited it out.
3 hours later and it still smells like I sprayed sunscreen on my arm.
This is a very subtle fragrance which surprised me.
To be honest, I sort of enjoy this sunscreen scent but I definitely would purchase a cheaper alternative."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","This is so beautiful. I'm a sucker for a good neroli, and this is just gorgeous. Zingy, slightly bitter, uplifting, fresh, a dream. I can almost see myself in a quaint rural village in the Mediterranean (and I grew up in rural/suburban Med so I should know!) when I close my eyes and sniff it.

The problem is that, while the fragrance itself is heavenly, the performance is only OK. Way underwhelming for such a high-end fragrance and the big bucks you have to spend to get it. It lasts maybe 5-6 hours total on my clothes, and only about 2 on my skin. Mind you, my skin hoovers up fragrance like a black hole and very few perfumes last on it more than 1-2 hours, but if it's specifically a TF one with THAT price, I'd expect more.

Would absolutely buy if it was significantly cheaper (like, 70% less), but for that price I'll not stock up once my sample has run out. It will be beautiful while it lasts, though!"

It's half glam and half peaceful and tranquil.

I try this on at Sephora, but it might go on my to buy list. I keep going back for this one and find flaws in everything else. Does that tell me anything?"

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I was so incredibly lucky to buy the candle of this incredible fragrance last Friday night. I'd been wanting this for a year or so but just could not justify the price. Anyway, i've waited three months for the film 'Call Me By Your Name' to get released on iTunes and last week it did. During the waiting of it, I wondered how I could make the evening just perfect. An evening with amazing friends and the perfect film. The film is set in Northern Italy during the summer of 1983. Instantly I realised that the smell of Neroli Portofino would be that definitive scent of the air in northern Italy and voila, only the best candle could replicate this... it had to be a TOM FORD NEROLI PORTOFINO candle. So with Illy espresso (as in the film), San Pellegrino, myself cooking Italian food for my friends and this candle, the evening was perfect.
It's the best film that i've seen in the last 10 years and oh my, this is the most beautiful, delicate, perfect candle that i've ever experienced in my life.
It's perfect.
Now my house as well as myself can smell of this surfing, summer beach, beach house fragrance. Just perfect!"

This fragrance is light and airy, and takes me right to summertime. Lots of citrus with a mild floral note that does not lean feminine nor masculine, and some sparkly, salty, aquatic vibes as well.

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","After finally smelling this, I would say Tom Ford's Neroli Portofino captures and epitomises what can only be described as a gourmand aquatic. Without getting too dramatic, it does smell a little bit like you're jumping into the waters of the Mediterranean. More than other classic aquatics like Cool Water, this one is deftly balanced by some truly lovely white florals, plus the bergamot and amber add much in the way of sophistication. However, the relatively poor longevity does not justify the price tag. Sadly I won't be getting my own bottle, but I will, however, keep getting free spritzes at David Jones..."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']",This is a gorgeous uplifting bright clean citrus scent.

Quality Excellent

It took me over 10 years to find my perfect fragrance and Neroli Portofino is it. I fell in love with it within the first one second of its introduction and six years later our love affair continues!
This fragrance doesn't shout! It's a true combination of the ultimate ingredients and essential oils that create a lemon, neroli and varied beach/beach house/free/healthy smell. OK, so it fades to become more of a body scent but to me, that's a great thing as strong fragrance annoys me and gives me a migraine!
Neroli Portofino has a magical scent that comes alive on your body every few hours - I guess as ones body heats up. It appears and it's truly incredible. This is the kind of cologne that you'd spray all over your naked body after the most incredible rainforest shower in a beautiful beach house before your day is greeted by the sunshine, beach and heartfelt friends!
The fragrance from it is sexy, stylish, chic, young, innocent, contemporary whilst being modern retro at the same time!
It's PERFECTION. It's the ultimate tanned, body smell. It'll transport you to happy times in Portofino, Italy or at that glamour beach house in the South of France. It's perfect for surfing in, a day on the beach or a classy opera/ballet/restaurant with friends. It's perfect for wearing with a T shirt and shorts OR a fitted suit. It's elegant but young, stylish but never pretentious or vulgar.
There's nothing like it for summer and summer night dreams. It's glamorous, fragile almost, incredibly elegant and full of dreams! It's sexy, it's perfect and you'll love it - but don't tell anyone - it's our secret!"

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Despite having a colder than usual summer this year, Neroli Portofino allowed me to still experience summer in a bottle. I normally don’t enjoy clean and fresh fragrances because they can feel too much like cleaning products. However; Tom Ford was able to achieve the perfect balance between crispness, fruitiness, and floral.
It’s vibrant and effervescent; it reminds me of champagne on an Italian beach or something. Any time I travel to a beach destination, I’ve always found myself bringing this fragrance along. My only gripe with it, is its wear time - some days it’ll last hours and others it’ll only last one. I’ve been able to prolong its wear by applying a water based makeup primer to the areas I intend to wear it on and have noticed it’ll last on me eight+ hours."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I just got a decant of this, as I will never ever be able to afford a bottle. I was excited to get this; based on the reviews it sounded like something I'd love. And I have to say, I do love it, except it wasn't as exceptional as I thought it might be for the price tag. I did see reviews comparing it to the 4711 cologne, so I guess I should have had an idea of the kind of scent it was, even if I couldn't recall if I'd smelled 4711 before.

Still, I do love the fragrance as it takes me back to my childhood. At first, I couldn't really place it, but I did a scan of the reviews and saw some comparing this to Nenuco, which was a huge part of my childhood. Although I couldn't remember its scent right off the bat, it must be this that Neroli Portofino reminds me of. Really fresh and lovely, but due to the memories, makes me think it could as well be a child's perfume. Nothing wrong with that, except for how much NP costs. It seems a bit simple for a designer perfume, although it does have a higher quality smell than Nenuco and such colognes. It's like a luxurious version of these.

Clean and fresh with a citrus opening, I would still love wearing this, particularly on a hot and humid day (which is most days in my country). It makes brings to mind weekends and idle days perfect for lazing around, the summers of my childhood. I will definitely wear it to bring back that feeling of my youth.

However, I wouldn't ever buy a full bottle, and perhaps will try 4711 instead when I use up my decant."

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I will start by saying I am not a Tom Ford fan. I find his fragrances way too pungent for my taste. After reading glowing reviews for this scent, I decided to try it. I don't understand the reviews that claim this is some kind of masterpiece. On me, this smelled exactly like suntan lotion. If you like beachy scents, there are plenty of options for much less money, such as Bobbi Brown Beach or Replica Beach Walk. Or pick up a bottle of your favorite sunscreen, it's good to protect your skin. As for my tendency to find TF fragrances pungent, this one wasn't nearly as strong, and probably would have needed refreshing after 4 hours if I wanted to keep it going. A definitely pass for my taste."

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Just tried my third scent from tom ford. I was totally in love with costa azzure I tried today and I got a bottle of Neroli as well today.

First thing it reminded me of for some reason was the pez's we had has a kid, the ones that you stack in a plastic dispenser with the funny shapes on the top which is a very pleasing scent. Comparing it to costa azzure there is an obvious lack of oud scent found in the costa, costa is my all time favorite scent as of now. The lemon is very noticeable for the first few hours then starts to fade into a very vibrant fruity seaside freshness.

On my skin this thing projects like a damn monster. Im getting 7-10 feet projection and im on my third to fourth hour now. Thinking about this I would have to say the forte version of this which is much stronger im not sure i could pull something so potent off although its worth a try. For my I guess I can see why they made a aqua version of this cause to my nose this is extremely strong in a good way. I guess maybee my nose picks up hits of musk and lemon more then others but yea to me its my most powerfull scent in my collection albeit my collection is still small."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I love this one. I don't understand, what is TF thinking? This used to be good performer! ""Well, if we tone it down people will spray more and consume more and hence buy more"". In reality, it has the exact opposite effect. People are going to spray less because of how precious it is, and they won't buy again knowing how poor the performance is now.

Here is a good business opportunity for you wannabe perfumers out there. Get some good fixative, mix it with 4711, and sell it at a affordable price. Boom! Money."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","A good quality neroli that nods to the classic colognes. Longevity is as expected for this style - it's comparable in performance to 4711 or Guerlain's Eau de Cologne Imperiale, from which it clearly takes cues. It's essentially a citrus floral with a nice herbal twist.

Neroli Portofino is, of course, very much on the pricier side for what is essentially a fleeting cologne. For the money, you do get a gorgeous bottle and a very well crafted scent, but it is hardly the benchmark neroli its reputation would have you believe. There are dozens of great neroli soliflores on the market today; Neroli Portofino is among them, and among the most expensive. Make of that what you will."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Unlike 4711, I think this perfume is best suited for evening time. Although its opening is very bright and citrus-laden, I find the dry-down to be very dark and complex with heavy musk notes. I find the overall presentation to be quite evocative and primal in nature. This fragrance is quite compelling and has a certain allure that draws one to it. Great unisex offering from TF. Love it!"
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","@Persefoni

$23 for a 50ml... I can tell you 100% that that's a fake. A roadside bazaar in Greece likely won't carry authentic TF products. Just sayin.

I have sampled this and it there's definitely more going on than with 4711. Longevity is on par for a fresh scent. I opted for the NP Acqua instead, but this one still appeals to me. Little heavier than Acqua, but really nice nonetheless."

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","this is a lot like 4711 and the likes....for quite a high price....having said that, it does generally sell for well below it seems looking at the comments and from my experience also....the longevity lasts quite a bit on me....running about 5 hours now....but the sillage kicks off strong but dies down relatively quickly....

i like the smell especially in the hot summer months....its a change for me from the usual heavy scents i prefer....wouldnt pay full price for this by any means....happy with the addition for the $80 i spent for the 50ml....some may differ and still think thats too much i know :)"

It is very short-lived and quite similar to 4711. I had smelled it when it first came out, as my mum loves 4711, but for 160 € who would buy a 50ml cologne? One that is gone in an hour?!!

Would you believe me if i said even 23 was expensive? Ts ts ts!! The reviewer who said Emperor's New Clothes is spot-on for this one!"

It's all rather style over substance - for example the Yves rocher neroli is better than this and £20 a bottle.
The bottles are ugly - dare I say pretentiously so?
I think this one smells like mouthwash."

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Thanks Jabbara97 for the decant;

Fresh, aquatic and even sweet. Gentlemen, don't be alarmed this is not feminine at all IMO; Unisex, but not feminine. There is some jasmine, citrus, lavender, and some....you guessed it, neroli that just pops! I don't think you could spray too much of this...I don't believe this will be cloying, abrasive, even aggressive for those around you.

Nice,..I mean, it is Tom Ford :o).

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Absolutely adore this stuff, the traditional neroli par excellence, bar none. Spring orange blossoms, creamy soap lather, Provençal herbs, clean skin, subtle Grasse jasmine. It's every bit as beautiful as it sounds.

Problem? This is absolutely not the EdP it is purported to be, and the price is simply extortionist; I've a gorgeously done 500 ml apothecary style bottle of (Roger et Gallet) Jean Marie Farina Eau de Cologne ""Extra Vieille."" It cost around $180 AUD, and ""Extra Vieille,"" which does have a good dose of neroli in its composition, can be made to last hours on clothes and skin if applied properly. Neroli Portofino on the other hand...? Most retailers are asking for around $420-$440 Australian Dollarydoos for 100 ml of a supposed EdP which disappears from the skin and fabric in about 2 hrs time, and has zero presence.

Beautiful as it is, that sort of money is hard to justify on something that disappears in the blink of an eye, even with a generous disposable income."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Hearing this scent was similar to my beloved 4711 made me buy a decant. I adore 4711, but of course, it lasts only an instant, enough time to wake up your brain and refresh you, then it's gone. I'd hoped Ford's Neroli Portfino would give me the same scent, only linger.

When my tiny bottle arrived, i had not selected my perfume for the day, so I immediately sprayed it on my left wrist, and was overjoyed to smell that yes, indeed, it is 4711. The opening scent is the same, a burst of orange, and citrus so juicy you can taste it. I put some 4711 on my right wrist to compare, and for a brief moment they were identical.

Then, in the Portofino, amber appeared, giving it a a richer, more golden and sophisticated scent. It was nice, but not my beloved splashy juice, it is more creamy, deeper. The 4711 stayed bright.

Dry down time, the 4711 was gone, the Portofino again smelling like mostly orange with a touch of amber. The further it gets from the middle, the more it gets to the beginning. It has been seven hours and I still can smell it, back to my beloved 4711 if I stick my wrist to my nose. On the 4711 side, of course, there is only my skin. Yet today, I smelled 4711 all day.

I enjoyed the decant and have enough for a few more uses. I will probably splash myself with 4711 and then use the rest of Mr. Fords blend together with that. On my skin, it does last. But after that, I do not think I'll buy, as it's too expensive to get almost the same. I think I'll stay with 4711, and reapply as needed. Now that 4711 has soaps and gels, I will do fragrance layering in the hopes of having something longer lasting. .

When you adore something, as I do 4711, when it is that pure for you, it's hard to accept the same thing with new notes. Neroli Portofino is more complex and deeper, and while beautiful, I can't help but just want my sparkling splash. So it will not be worth the price to me. If you are unfamiliar with 4711, then this may be the Neroli perfume of your dreams."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","The bottle reminds me of blue oceans, but this is too expensive considering what it is, and the lasting power. It's interesting that it smells like a cologne splash from 1799. 4711 is so affordable and comes in an enormous size, so I'd choose it on a hot summer day. You can always decant it into a spray bottle."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I both have this and 4711. Neroli Portofino smells like a slightly sweeter and much more refined 4711 -- like a $100 white tee shirt vs. a $20 white tee shirt. I think it's an elegant, balanced, and upscale take on a neroli cologne, and it's one with slightly more depth without losing its freshness. Does this push new boundaries? No, but I don't feel like it needs to. And it's easily unisex. I'm a woman and I enjoy wearing this, but would also like it on a man.

Just one thing though. When I wear cologne water I like the experience of liberally shaking it out onto my hand and patting it everywhere, which you can't do with this (and especially at this price point). So I personally kind of prefer the less expensive, more casual 4711 for my neroli cologne needs."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I have the opportunity to tried a sample last summer. It was really cool because i was in a boat at Portofino and i decide to try this Neroli portofino directly in Portofino to embrace the scent at 360 degrees!
At that time i loved the smell, but then (last week) i went to Naples (near Posillipo).
And guys what a really embarrassing discovery..............

What a really embarrassing discovery............

Basically every single bathroom near the sea has this exactly smell.

I don't know why but there are only two options:

Option one: Neroli Portofino has 0 quality and is the same scent that luxury hotels near the coast of Naples use as a clean detergent for their bathrooms.

Option two: Those hotel are so luxurious that can afford to use the real Neroli Portofino as a clean detergent for their bathrooms.

I'm sorry for Tom Ford lovers but i think is the one...

So to make a long story short:

Scent: 6,5/10 (Even if is a detergent smell is still a nice smell)
Longevity: 4 hour
Sillage: Poor
Projection: Not really a skin scent but really close

Ah.... Versatility? Mah.. Beh... Boh... It is a casual ""happy"" fragrance but can be used even in office or in a formal situation. And is only for spring/summer days... i can't really imagine a different use..

Trust the truffle dog, it knows the rules of the game."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","The best barbershop scent I have smelled to date. A classic. Smells just like 4711 (Muelhens) but more potent. A must for your collection, imo."

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I've tried so hard to like this but as soon as the fizzy top notes fade, it is soap, more soap, and nothing but soap. And not the good kind. I'm no citrus hater, but this just isn't one of the good ones, it doesn't smell fresh. And for that price, it is just appalling. Big fat pass."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Nice citrus neroli perfume, but short lived, very short lived. For that price you expect something a bit more persistent.
Pity..."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I picked this up mainly because I'm a sucker for citrus aromatics, but also to see what the hype is all about. As most people have noted, this fragrance smells exactly the same as 4711, but at 15-20 times the price. Is it worth it?

In my books, yes. While both fragrances smell similar, there's a certain depth and sophistication that's lacking in 4711 that Neroli Portofino offers. Don't get me wrong, I love both fragrances. But 4711 is what I would wear when I'm heading to the supermarket, while Neroli Portofino would be reserved for that special date. I don't see myself buying another bottle anytime soon, but will cherish every drop of the bottle that I do have.

I get moderate longevity out of this one (around 5-6 hours), with average sillage."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","After smelling this and Acqua di parma's essenza di colonia today, I realized that I hadn't smelled any neroli based perfumes before and I must admit, I don't need to any time soon. I was under the impression that this was universally liked, but if that's so then my nose must be from another dimension. To me this smell isn't even bearable, it's just awfull."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I think Neroli Portofino is a breathtakingly beautiful blend of naturally fresh Mediterranean citruses, flowers and herbs supporting the purest neroli and orange flower absolute you can imagine. Very expensive yes, but the quality of this perfume clearly outshines all the other neroli based fragrances I've tried.

The scent itself is very similar to Mäurer & Wirtz 4711, which is exquisitely refreshing but light as a feather and lasts only a brief moment. Neroli Portofino on the other hand manages both to capture and refine the essence of the classic refreshing citrus cologne and to make it last. On my skin this gem stays lovely, crisp and fresh yet smooth and creamy for well past six hours.

Simply angelic! ☆☆☆☆☆"
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']",I bought one 100 ml. bottle for $13. Fresh and interesting barbershop fragrance. I think in hot summer days will be great to wear

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","My only complaint is that the fragrance doesn't last longer. The dry down is absolutely amazing. The flankers are ok and last longer but the original is a masterpiece. It does smell similar to 4711 in the opening, but smell your skin 90 mins after application. Absolutely amazing!!!! The best things in life are sometimes worth the price. I used to think this was overpriced until I realized how superior the dry down is to anything else I own. Absolute masterpiece and a must recommend for any gentleman!!!

The projection and longevity are lacking, but in my world you want a scent that is clean, light, and pleasant. Perfect for the office and light enough to not offend any of my clients.

If you want a more masculine version then check out the forte flanker, which is very good,, but in my humble opinion the original has all the magic!"
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I love this and it's so different from anything else I have really. It is essentially unisex but isn't too masculine that a girl couldn't wear it and smell great. It is basically a fresh Neroli fragrance, perfect for warm days ideally. Highly recommended if you want something a bit different."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I always pick a sample of this stuff when I get the chance, it really does smell nice, clean and inoffensive, but in the end, it's just not worth the asking price for a full bottle when there are so many other neroli-based fragrances that are so close to this in effect to be had for a fraction of the price.
If you have the money to spend, though, you could definitely do worse, it is really nice and easy to wear, never too sweet, sharp or soapy."

Reminds me of walking through our front yard of different orange trees and other citrus trees growing up.

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I love this smell for one reason, it reminds of the barbershop cologne they used to splash on my neck after each haircut when I was little, the one that you feel before you smell, and it felt like acid on raw skin. I can still remember the barbers grin whenever they did that, it was their feeling of fulfillment when they see the victim (customer) grimace with the their neck on fire. I still remember the bottle they used, it came in 2 sizes (500 & 1000 ml) of evil torture.

This is what NP from TF reminds me of, its a typical barbershop cologne.

The scent itself is nice, its sweet, full of white florals, and very citrussy. There is no heavy or skanky scnets there, just alot of freshness.

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","This smells EXACTLY like a day at the beach. Not coconut, tropical, fruity like people would like to fool you into thinking a beach smell is. No, this is exactly like you went swimming in the sea with your friends and then emerged glittering with water droplets to lie on your towel in the sun and eat greasy food from vendors walking back and forth on the beach with their carts. EXACTLY like a beachy day of sun and surf. Whether this is appealing to you is a personal matter of taste.

I love it, it almost seems like a slightly citrusy woody scent to me. This is amazingly refreshing and clean in summer heat.

It's not complicated and it doesn't have layers, it is linear. Some people tell me it smells like soap when I wear it.

However, it is very expensive so it might not be worth the price tag to you.

I think it is one of the best scents ever made. Must-buy."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","I am usually not a big neroli fan but this is one of the nicest neroli fragrances I have ever smelled. A lot of neroli fragrances tend to have an old musty smell to me and this is crisper and cleaner. So fresh and beautiful. Neroli fragrances have literally been around since the invention of cologne so this is hardly groundbreaking. But what it happens to be is a perfected neroli ""cologne"". While it does share a similar scent with 4711 (and countless other neroli based fragrances), the difference in quality is pretty apparent. I have 4711 and don't enjoy it while I love Neroli Portofino.The quality and fragrance far surpasses 4711 and is also more female friendly. It lasts all day on me. The blue bottle is also stunning. NP is the perfect go to daily scent and is a refreshing change from heavier or more dramatic perfumes. I absolutely love it."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Like others have said, to me this one is EXACTLY like 4711 original. I had a small bottle of it back in the 80's and always loved the fresh smell.

When I took the cap off this at Sephora for a sniff, it immediately reminded me of 4711. I knew nothing of this perfume, just wanting to try Black Orchid and noticed the pretty green bottle. I sprayed it on my wrist thinking it might change, but it was uncannily similar to 4711.

I honestly don't smell any of the notes - not that I'm any good at it, but it just smells like clean laundry or soap. Just fresh and clean and eminently pleasant."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","While there are a lot of comments that say this smells like 4711, it somehow doesn't. For me, it's not even close. Why do i love this? It simply reminds me of childhood happiness. There was this spanish cologne i used all the time as a kid. Uncomplicated, fresh, green, citrus notes. Heavenly even if doesn't stay as long as i expect. I wouldn't mind spraying again in the day. If my bottle runs out i just might get another one for nostalgia."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Amazing neroli perfume (maybe the best out there) BUT with major longevity and projection issues. It is very similar with the 4711 cologne. The price is over the top.

Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","Like Grey Vetiver before it, Neroli Portofino is a sincere take on a classic cologne, dressed up and modernized with the standard Ford treatment. There's a ride called ""Soarin"" at Disney's Epcot theme park in Orlando. It's a great relaxing flight simulator that allows riders to glide along in front of a massive IMAX style screen. At one point you soar over vast orange fields, and are hit with a lush blast of orange scent That's exactly what Neroli Portofino brought to mind. Inside this translucent green bottle is the most epic orange and classic, royal soap. A gorgeous summer fragrance with some real staying power. I'm transported to historic hotels in Florida with Mediterranean architecture, marble floors, and beautiful, old swimming pools with waterfalls and coral caves. But a quick trip back to reality ensures me once again that I am not a rich man. It was fun while it lasted, but I'm afraid I have to settle with Mugler cologne, Neroli's excellent peasant cousin."
Neroli Portofino Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2011,"['citrus', 'white floral', 'fresh spicy', 'aromatic']","A musky floral with laundry-like notes; fresh but soapy. A bit too heady for me; I sometimes find neroli and orange blossom a bit much and that's certainly the case here. There's also the edge of something unpleasantly synthetic and a bit cheap smelling, perhaps that vaguely aquatic note. Projection and longevity are pretty poor. All in all, I can't recommend this, especially at this price. For my neroli fix I think I'll stick with Bottega Veneta's Knot."

First, I don’t get the boozy vibe from a gin&tonic, instead I get a beautiful spicy and floral Cardamom mixed with Lemons and Tea leaves. To supplement the green-accord from this, Mr. Ellena even placed even more green notes and I get a fresh dewy grass smell. Rounded out by Cedar and White musk - really well-made."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']",I don’t understand why this perfume is called delicate and soft. It's too sharp. It is so sharp that it even causes headaches. The smell 10 years ago had intoxicated me with its wonder. Who can help me? Why is the smell of 10 years ago not even 1% similar to the smell of today? I give 100/100 to the scent 10 years ago and 0 to the scent now.
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Lovely perfume, lasts about 8 hours on my skin. Quite unique and a much more pleasant version of Terre d'Hermes.
If you like this, you should try Dior Homme 2020: a much more rounded and addictive scent than Voyage, IMO."

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Perfect for a sunny spring day. Its smells clean and green. It smells like a delicious tea would smell. I have not much to add. I think the people commented before me, had it right. Its a great smell, but gets very close to the skin fast. It is unisex. But I think its a bit better suited for a man."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","I tried this again today at a store. I used to have this perfume and it brought back good memories, Such an excellent perfume. Lovely. Too bad it completely disappeared on my skin. You could not smell it. Still, I love it."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","There’s a strong blast of gin on the initial spray, and then it settles into a blend of soft coconut curry and lemon tea. I would say this leans slightly masculine but overall pleasant and something I would wear.

The bottle design irks me. It looks cool and all, but it’s not very functional.

Edit: the more I use this, the more I’ve been loving it. The dry down is my favorite. It gives you a very comforting feeling and has a hint of sweetness."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","In 2010, when I was 10 years old, my uncle was taking tourists, one day he invited me to my grandfather's house, we went, and there were French tourists. One of them gave me a small copy of this perfume, yes, I remember. a running horse, and a white dove on top of the horse. I sniffed it and was silent for a moment because I had never smelled a perfume like this before. How wonderful. I never used this perfume again because I forgot the name, But I remembered the picture. Ten years later, I searched for it in the picture. I only used it once, but the smell is still in my brain. But I'm hesitant to buy it now because its smell has changed. I am afraid of that.
Please tell, if you have a version released in 2010, does it smell 100% similar to the current version?
has it been reformulated?"
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Green, fresh-musky, classy.

When I hear Voyage I imagine sunny and windy weather, and middle-aged pair with horn-rimmed glasses and dressed in white linen loose clothes, with brown leather valises is hurrying to the small jet plane. And this scent totally reflects my imagination. That’s the case when the name suits perfectly the scent profile.

This is totally Ellena’s style, so if you like his works you’ll definitely like this one. I wish it could be more long-lasting, but unfortunately, we have what we have. It starts with bitter green lemon and cardamom, then musk takes its place and the scent becomes a bit warmer yet fresh. It pushes about an hour or so and completely disappears after 4-5 hours from my skin.

I would recommend buying a 35ml bottle with a 125ml refill instead of a 100ml bottle that’s a bit ugly and unhandy to my taste. To me, EDT better than EDP in terms of smell, despite they are almost the same."

Declaration by Cartier has no the power, and imprint of the initial Cartier s seasons but is just more complex of Voyage... This Hermes fragance sinned of a common cologne."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']",Smells wonderful and fresh but longevity and projection are absolute jokes. I get around 1 hour of longevity before it completely disappears from my skin after 6 sprays. Maybe it's the new batch.
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","I have no patience with endless iterations of 'pink sugar', which so many feminines seem to be, so this unisex fragrance is a refreshing offering.

It is spicy and woody, like an old cedarwood chest, and there is a distinct but not overpowering citrus freshness. The drydown is essentially a softer version of the opening.

Do I like how it smells? Yes. Do I want to wear it? No, but I can see plenty of people wanting to."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","The page said: woody floral musk, it smells more like spicy citrusy to me. And because I work with a lot of spices (I love them!) it speaks gourmand, but not the sweet kind, it's savory.

Voyage d'Hermès is a shy and polite scent. Sillage is moderate, unintrusive, but enough. I'll see how the performance later. It's categorized as uni and I have to agree, though it smells pretty much feminine to me. Also, this is a day time perfume. You might want a stronger scent for night occasion (or maybe you don't).

This find is a bit of a surprise. I didn't expect it to be available in my usual store. Hence my quick buy. This scent is a tribute for my late friend who said he liked it. Now I get to remember him (and how he smelled) whenever I spray this perfume.

I like the scent, objectively speaking. And since it's my friend's favorite I like it even more. As a memorabilia though. For someone else, I think the scent fits for someone who wants to smell good without being noticed too much, all while throwing the fun in (because the spice!)."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Fresh and a bit spicy. Elegant, pleasant and expensive smelling. It's soft and sensual. Great scent! Dominant notes are tea and cardamon.
Final Note : 9 / 10"
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","A cardamom centric fragrance. Opening is very zesty, and uplifting. Cardamom, lemon, and a peppery musk dominate the heart and base notes. I'm a fan of Ellena's work and even though Voyage smells nice and pleasant, it's nothing more than that. Nothing really here that will blow your socks off. A safe option which is suitable almost anytime. Performance is fairly weak due to its transparent nature but if you enjoy lighter scents and like the smell of cardamom then this would be a good option.

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","This has to be one of my favorite fragrances in terms of scent profile in the whole world, but one of my least favorite in terms of performance, as others have pointed out. It's an absolutely addicting blend of citrus, tea, wood, and musk with a beautifully rendered cardamom note. It's clean, airy, billowy, and out-of-the-shower fresh, but there's also a little bit of dirtiness or earthiness undergirding the whole thing that adds a sexy edge. It's genderless, ageless (in my opinion, though one might argue that it better suits someone 20+), and just phenomenal in every way EXCEPT for performance. It's pretty much an instant skin scent for me, with a longevity of maybe 2-3 hours, practically EDC in terms of strength. Now, I must add that I do live in a subtropical, bordering on tropical, climate with extremely hot and humid weather, and I have perfume eating skin. Even so, I've applied Voyage d'Hermes in an air conditioned environment without going outside and gotten the same outcome. Wearing this on my daily walk to work resulted in total annihilation, with not even a trace of the fragrance remaining after fifteen minutes. I've plowed through my 35ml (very cool) bottle of Voyage within a matter of months. This reflects both my love for the fragrance (and I do truly love the smell) and its utter lack of performance. For that reason, despite the fact that I adore the smell, I will either be purchasing the Parfum once my bottle is finished, or looking elsewhere.

If you see a ""deal online"" go for it (say $40.00 or so). Not a good blind buy IF you own Cartier Declaration already / not a good blind buy if you DISLIKE Cartier Declaration (of which, this is only slightly better). Bottle design can be a curse OR a blessing to whoever may own it. LOL.
That said it's hard to find anything actually bad from the house of Hermes !"
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","This is beautiful, my favourite cardamom fragrance. Perfect for when I want a clean fragrance without the citrus in slightly colder weather, when AdP and most citrus are just too light.

So understated. This juice makes me think of fresh white linen.

Performance is rather weak but to be expected given the composition. Surprisingly, I get better performance from the EDT. Prefer it to the EDP also (which I also really like). If you're thinking about getting the EDP due to performance of the EDT I'd advise to try it first.

Great for the office and most daytime occasions, also spring/ summer nights"
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Hermes Voyage is a lovely light, refreshing fragrance suited perfectly for warmer weather. It is perfectly unisex with neither traditionally masculine or feminine undertones, though as cardamom is used extensively in men's fragrances, I can see how some would find this leaning masculine by association.
Comparable cardamom-centric fragrances such as Cartier Declaration and Narciso Rodriguez Bleu Noir are more complex, heavier, and just a bit more interesting to me. Voyage is cleaner, more transparent albeit more fleeting on my skin than the others. Indeed, it is quite subtle. When considered next to my favorites (Declaration l'Eau and NR Bleu Noir) Voyage seems a little thin by comparison as I prefer the others. However, if you are seeking a representative cardamom fragrance of good quality, this one is an excellent choice."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']",I have a sample of this in both EDT and EDP and for some reason I get 'celery' in among the notes. I have also detected that same 'celery' ... an almost bitter and not attractive celery note in Versace Ethereal. I really wanted to like these but I can't get past the 'past its prime' celery aroma. What is that? I know many don't detect this. Is it connected to the 'peach' note? I need to scrub off because it has such an adverse effect. Someone tell me what I am smelling pls. :-(
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","EDT > EDP

I sampled both today, and the edt was both superior in sillage and skin scent, even after I washed my hands!

Wow, this is a beauty! Can't wait until my next payday!"
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","I get a strong dry juniper which seems to burn off very quickly and is followed by earthy cardamom with maybe a little bit of ginger and nutmeg (?). It continues along it's earthy-spicy-woody way, becoming very faint after 30min. I do catch wafts of it at ~1ft distance but it's very airy and light, I need to get within 1"" of my skin to smell it strongly and consistently at this point.

I'll have to try this again soon, I enjoy it while also not knowing what to think of it."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Ice cold gin and cardamom. I can't fathom why it's labeled ""warm spicy"" - the scent is frigid!

It's not a ""natural"" arctic smell - I know the arctic, I live in it - it lacks the smoky ozone bite of natural frost. This is like the blast from a walk-in freezer.

Reminds me a bit of a particular brand of cleaning fluid we have here in Scandinavia - Ajax window cleaner, but without the ammonia. I don't mind, the smell is cleanliness incarnated.

I imagine it's what Tilda Swinton's witch Queen Jadis would have worn in ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"", espcially in warmer weather when it looses its cleanliness and turns a bit animalic.

I wear it year round, but actually prefer it in the colder months. It's a confidence booster. Ice Queen me."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","What comes to mind? A tailor made white shirt, designer shades, freshly washed hair that dried in the summer wind. It is elegant, clean cut scent. Minimalism and high quality. Voyage gives me good vibes, makes me feel content and puts a smile on my face, even if it's cold outside. Still manages to transfer me to a beautiful place, where the sun always shines."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Voyage is a strange one. I was expecting to smell almond (which always smells like glue to me!); fortunately, no screechy glue scent here. Instead, it is dominated by green notes, tea, leather and musk. The leather is soft and understated, hence it doesn’t overwhelm the senses. It lasts for quite a few hours; the opening is on the sharper side, but then it mellows and becomes even greener than before. Sillage is moderate."

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","I doubt people who are referencing YSL La Nuit Dl'Homme as a cardamom dominant fragrance have tried this. This has the most authentic cardamom accord that I have ever smelled period. It is fresh, bitter and spicy, has the signature DNA of JC Ellena. Not very much a crowd pleaser but a well rounded fragrance all in all and of high quality."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","To think that I almost missed this one just because it was in the men's section!

A reviewer said earlier that the dry down smells like deers balls and as funny as that sounds, I can see why!

Very animalic, also very masculine in the opening. In time it becomes lighter and more suitable for a woman, while also maintaining what I personally identify as a leather accord.

I have a hard time choosing between the EDT and the Parfum version, for warmer seasons this would be the better choice. Both, however, exude good taste and a great sense of style."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Very Nice Scent, It is a laundry scent however. Performance isn't enviable, but the scent and it's potency is just right. If you want something that will scream louder that's also a laundry scent, try Versace's The Dreamer"
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","This, simply, smells divine.

Nothing more, nothing less, it is just a beautiful smell.

Its understated, in the most Hermes way.

I want my clothes to smell like this, I want to smell like this, I want people to smell this on me.

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","This is everything I never knew I needed from a hot weather fragrance, and I absolutely hate that it took me so long to find it.

I am, historically, a wearer of ""men's fragrances"" in the heat. I do like my fragrances to be very feminine, generally, but fragrances made for women typically rest on a bed of sweetness, which, in the high heat, I am unable to tolerate without developing a blinding headache. (Phew. What a run-on sentence!) My solution? Layer my femme fragrances over uber-clean, uber-fresh men's summer fragrances, my favourites being Bleu de Chanel (yup!) and Boss Orange by Hugo Boss. I had all but given up on ever finding a women's summer fragrance that was 'enough' in and of itself.

I initially was decided on purchasing Dior Homme Cologne for my summer scent this year. Fresh enough, clean enough, a little bit spicy, tolerable longevity (though below par) and though not at all femme enough for me, I thought, ""Well, this is probably the closest I'm going to get."" ... which is a dangerous thing to think in the perfume world. There is actually a *perfect* fragrance for everything if you are patient enough.

Enter Voyage d'Hermes. Oh me, oh my. It smells like iced black Indian masala chai with lemon slices in it. That only happens to be my FAVOURITE summer drink (to be fair, Indian chai is my favourite drink all year, iced or steaming hot, as appropriate). It's fresh, but... unexpectedly so. Usually, you get a mojito or something (looking at Acqua di Gioia for example), something fresh but sweet, too. This is not sweet at all, but also doesn't veer too far into masculine territory for the lack of sweetness. It is exactly unisex. Or sexless? But... sexy, too, with the cool spicy cardamom. It dries down to a soapy, clean, somewhat woody skinscent, which reminds me of the smell of a docked boat somehow. Ugh. I absolutely LOVE the scent of this.

Performance is wanting, I only get a max of 4 hours, but I wouldn't spring for the parfum because I personally don't mind reapplying, since I love the initial burst of this. Sillage is about arm's length, which is my general comfort zone. Surprisingly, it is also a crowdpleaser! I was at a late lunch in the sweltering heat one day, and I touched up the scent. Everyone appreciated the freshness so much that my bottle ended up getting passed around the table for everyone to get a little spritz! Then the waiter said our table smelled very good. (Usually, people groan about perfume in the heat...)

A definite must-try for anyone who is looking for an unusual hot weather scent, male or female. Jean Claude Ellena, you are a genius. Voyage has set the stage for every subsequent summer fragrance I try to disappoint me."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","This is really one of the most beautiful scents I've ever smelled. The lemon here isn't a typical juicy or sharp lemon, but more like a lemon cookie, mixing with fresh spices and soft woods, all with a light, airy texture. Voyage is the DEFINITION of casual elegance. Reminds me of a sunny spring day, or lounging on a patio overlooking the Mediterranean while the breeze blows through your white linen shirt."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","I forget about this one sometimes which is unfortunate. Every time I wear it I fall in love with it again.

Voyage d'Hermes combines two of my favorite notes, grapefruit, and cardamon. The green, watery notes add a clean freshness that makes Voyage d'Hermes perfect for the office. Or the tennis court. Or any daytime activity really.

It is definitely unisex. It's soft and understated, but with a hint of gin and tonic. It's a very elegant fragrance"
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']",I'm a woman and find this scent intoxicating. I haven't smelled it on a man yet...soon I hope! The first things I smell are a blast of pepper and cardamom which makes it quite sharp (which I adore). Then it just mellows to a fresh woodsy and slightly zesty lemon. Wonderful!
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","I really enjoyed the tester, so bought it..upon receiving it, although I like the fresh aromatic spiciness, I felt it wasn't typically feminine enough for my taste..it smells similar to Dior cologne, and I felt it was more appropriate for young men, so I was happy to give it to my 15 year old son..it is a fresh classy scent, the fresh notes mix well with a woodsy undertone.,more masculine smell and the bottle too is more suited for guys..great scent by Hermes ."

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","This is so good, but i think they are really having a hard time making it last so they add this little ingredient. The bugspray drydown of Hermes Colognes esp the citrus scent needs this specific ingredient, and the smoky fumes from traffic at the rooftop in Paris in su le toit isnt really meant to be there. They add Petroleum to all their citrus scents to make it last thats why it smells like bug spray and traffic fumes.

Update: It took me a long time loving this fragrance, It smells ginger. Its so complex but its simple. Well balanced. If you want to love this fragrance do not use this like a cologne after bath you will not appreciate this. Use this when youre traveling or walking a lot. This really reflects the brand. Simple but elegant. It does not get boring and everytime you get a whiff you get a different note animalic musk to lemon and ginger juice. This is not for everyone. Only for certain people who likes to be unique and smart. If you dress smart and wear this then you certainly are smart and you want to be different than what the crowd wants (*bleu de chanel, terre dhermes, ck one ehem niche cliche). Then they will like this because you are wearing this. This is not a ""smell me please! all nose on me!"" perfume. The scent is only for the people that is close to you and can get near you. This scent is not douchebaggy like ""f*ck me girls i smell good"" perfume. This is more like of a directive, young and beautiful/handsome CEO of a design brand or the perfume of the teen sons/daughter of a Hotel Founder.

Very animalic on the dry down. Smells like deers balls."

Very like Acqua di Parma Ginepro di Sardegna but not quite as long lasting. Very unisex, and a great summer weather fragrance that doesn't smell like sunscreen. It's the scent of dry woods warmed by the summer sun carried on a salt breeze."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","I find this scent very soap like.

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Just when I thought I was getting good at detecting notes, this perfume has baffled me. I smell fig leaf, like, more than anything else. But there is no fig to be seen, and nobody seems to smell it either. Very strange. To my nose, underneath the fig leaf, there is the unmistakeable Ellena/Hermés DNA. I can definitely smell a resemblance between this and Un Jardin sur le Nil. I don't smell spicy notes, certainly not cardamom... I'm baffled. This is very nice, though. Refreshing, botanical, and juicy."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","I like it! Very pleasant and smooth citrus/cardamom dominant scent. In fact it could be one of my favourite warm weather scents if it had at least a high-moderate performance. After 1 hour or so, it becomes a skin scent with zero sillage/projection. Not even a scent bubble that many prada edp create."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","I don't find this at all masculine - quite feminine in fact, and beautiful at that. So interesting how different scents read differently on different people."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","A pleasant, refreshing offering from Hermes. A potent citrus that hangs around for a surprisingly long time! Sharp lemon combines with cardamom and spicy pepper for a likeable, stylish fragrance. I wish I could wear this but it's definitely too masculine for me. Another great fragrance from Hermes, though."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","To me this smelled a little like CK One plus cardamom. The cardamom is very prominent initially. If I didn't already associate cardamom with food, I think I'd enjoy this scent more. There is a classy little touch of musk that compliments the other notes. Once the cardamom slap to the face wears off a little bit, the drydown is a well balanced, pleasant scent. I will give it that, but frankly its resemblance to CK One torques me for the money I paid for it. This is not a cologne where you're going to walk into a room and wow anybody. It didn't seem to project well. I'd return this if I hadn't lost the receipt. I'll try wearing this for awhile to see if it grows on me, but I'm not holding my breath."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","This is a nice perfume for daily use.
It has some fine notes. It opens with a citric-spicy note of citrus and cardamom that is embedded in a green tea-like note.
The last note that is also present is the musk but very subtle.
This perfume has something easy going and gives freshness.
It reminds me a bit of cologne 4711 that is used in the same way as the title of this perfume suggests. I guess that is why they made this perfume deliberately in a way you can use it as often as you need it. Because the longevity and the silage is not that great. But the notes in it are very harmonious.
When to use on warm days, when y on the road, when ever and mostly, spring, summer, just as refreshment and of course unisex because it has class; its Hermes."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Amazing scent. Fresh yet musky at the same time.

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Very woody indeed, opens like pencil shavings. Maybe a very slight hint of metal as well. It warms up very nicely into something like Lancaster D'Light and Burberry Woman but slightly more sophiticated. Very good genuinely unisex perfume. I'd be happy with anybody who smelled like this.
Also I found this very long lasting indeed, all day and definitely longer on clothes."

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Bright, somewhat harsh-edged opening. A bit of citrus, slightly spicy, along with some vegetal green, followed by a much softer, vaguely floral heart. Honestly I can't even detect the base notes in this, and it's a skin scent within 45 minutes. Totally gone in 2-3 hours. Note: these results are from a decant worn mainly in air-conditioned spaces in a tropical country.

Disappointing for me. I love my Terre d'Hermes, and I'm a fan of the Jardin series. This scent is just OK, and longevity is such an issue (at least on my skin and in these conditions) that I don't think a bottle would be worth the price.

What has worked much better for me has been layering this with Philosykos (EDT). Somehow the two short-lived fragrances seem to make each other last somewhat longer in combination, and also the Hermes seems to tamp down the coconut note which I feel is a bit too prominent in Philosykos. The scents really complement each other well. So it's a winning combo."

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","this stuff is pure magic mmm

this is one of the best citrus openings ever its so uplifting and mood changing from the first spray

its citrus note (lemon) & warm spics (cardamom) hit just right in its opening followed by some middle notes of tea florals and earthy accords which just projects off the skin beautifully the dry down is just as wonderful with hints of wood and musk but thats where it all ends for me

unfortunately this scent doesn't let its beauty last since longevity is a big issue i dont know how well the edp version does in that regard but I'm willing to break my golden rule and still buy this scent

i may just have to carry around a atomizer to make this last throughout the day

do yourself a favour and give this one a try

thank me later ;)

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","It has one of those ""fresh citrus"" openings unlike any other, with a prominent realistic cardamon blast that's both awakening and mouth watering (one of my favorite accent spices for cooking). Minutes after the opening, cardamon shares its spotlight with the rest of the crowd, turning into a well blended aromatic fresh spicy scent."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Voyage d'Hermes is another masterpiece from the house of Hermès. I feel this unisex fragrance is more suited for men, but could very well see this on a woman. This is my go to for when I just want to smell fresh and clean. It is very well balanced. The citrus opening is typical of say for most of Hermès cologne, but this one also has a blast of cardamom. Now, I wouldn't recommend it for the summer as the cardamom is overwhelming with the heat. It is wonderful though any other time of year, moreso than most other cardamom fragrances. The mid notes are very interesting to me, its a unique mix of spicy oriental, aquatic, and green. I usually am not a fan of outright aquatic or green fragrances, but voyage is really balanced nicely. The dry down then turns into this lovely woody peppercorn essence. The longevity is average, 3-4 hours with probably 6-8 on clothing. Projection could be s bit better. The bottle design is especially cool and plays into the equestrian heritage of the house. The packaging also is dead on with the feeling if the juice. Overall, another winner for Hermès and for those who want a nice, clean everyday fragrance that's unique."

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","I have no idea whether you are the kind of people who experience recurrent dreams. You know, the kind where Chucky chases you down with a chainsaw along the hallway of your school, or where you show up naked at your workplace, or where you are taking the same math test you once failed over and over again. Most of my friends tell me they dream of flying, over and over again. And each time they do I cannot shake a certain feeling of fascination: because I never dreamed of flying nor does it seem like a desirable activity to me. I guess my feet are just too firmly on a ground of my own making to experience such ‘lofty’ desires. So as I was saying, I never dreamed of flying. Until the moment I unscrewed the cap of a bottle of Hermes’ Voyage.

Beauty addicts are surely conversant with Hermes as a label – from the iconic Birkin bags to the magnificent silk scarves and the over the top outstanding fragrances. Funnily Hermes started out as a manufacturer of riding attire – you know, saddles, whips (not that kind of whips, you naughty people ;-) ) and the like, and slowly started moving in the luxury items direction, until it finally metamorphosized into the world’s ultimate symbol of luxury and opulence. I am not a huge fan of Hermes, admittedly – I would go for LV or Dior any day of the week – but I have to give them credit for boundless originality and a certain unmistakable touch to each and every one of their products. You can instantly recognize a Hermes – and once you recognized it, it’s bound to be unforgettable.

Imagine being an eagle, or a swan. Your wings are spread, your gaze fixed on a horizon which is never out of reach. Beneath you snowy mountain tops, silvery lakes with silvery fish leaping playfully through a crystal clear surface. Fields of green, juicy, vivid, complete green, daisies and lavender, forest groves, deer grazing in the distance, and sun, sun, sun – endlessly luminous. The air is so fresh and clean it’s almost intoxicating. You can hear no sounds – just distant echoes from the hilltops, remembrances of the beauty of a world you left behind. You breathe in, and out. There is nothing in that blue infinity but you and a God of your own making. Have you ever smelled freedom? This is how it tastes like.

Voyage is officially classified as woody musky – in my book it is airy ethereal. The cleanliness of this scent, the purity, the otherworldliness are simply impossible to put into words. This truly IS the smell of air – or at least the way I imagine the air above the highest mountain tops might smell like. For my entire life I have been an worshipper of heavy, opulent, hypnotizing scents – but I admit I find myself completely enveloped by this magical, surreal broth. There’s one thing I have to say, though: you need patience with this fragrance. In the beginning you will be hit by that typical Hermes vegetal note which is present in everything from the Jardin collection to the male Terre (which I ADORE – though sniffing the pure perfume version last week was a huge disappointment – I’ll be back on this one), and which I abhor. Luckily, in Voyage it subsides pretty fast, giving way to that delicious airiness I mentioned before. So be patient, it’s completely worth it.

Voyage is officially unisex – but I have to say it clearly moves much more in the male direction – which is perfectly fine with me (Gaultier Squared is, to my nose, though unisex, clearly feminine, and so is Rabanne’s One Million, which is labeled a male scent). I can imagine an English aristocrat in a white silk shirt wearing it on the marble terrace of his countryside chateau, sipping a glass of Hennessey, overlooking the garden labyrinth, the white pebble pathways, the wrought iron gates that separate his estate from the rest of the world. He is looking up at the skies, taking the world in. And the world is his.

Wear this one when you feel there is no limit to how high you are allowed to get your hopes. When you feel like you can soar not only the sky, but all skies. When your life grows wings and unfolds into what you never dared dream it could be. Voyage is not simply a scent of flying. It is not only flight – it’s levitation."

cardamom combined with spices in more than a perfect ratio with a dry down of charismatic wood are enough to clear your mind & make you ready for a successful day
Very serious problem with EDT is that neither the projection nor the longevity support the awesomeness of this fragrance
It just disappears in less than 2 hours
Projection can be compromised but too short lasting time becomes the convincing reason to think twice before you buy this elegant fragrance

I love this, it honestly smells EXACTLY like Indian tea boiling, with the the green cardamom at the forefront,which is the centerpiece of not only Indian tea but also Voyage D'Hermes, an ode to Cardamom and spices with a refreshing twist. There are some similarites with this and Apres les Mouson. Where as Apres Les Mouson is all about the wet forests of Southern India, Voyage D'Hermes conujures up images of Tea Plantations in India

This is one of them. Cardamon combined with floral notes didn't work well for me. The initial whiffs were clogging. But eventually, say about an hour or so it left a nice but not so pleasant ambery and a slight musky kind of fragrance.
I would never wear this when im gonna have a tuff day at work and definitely not when im annoyed. Its not supposed to be a morale booster or a mood uplifter for me. I'd wear this fragrance when im going to the beach on a sunny afternoon or maybe not."

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Yet another excellent fragrance by J-C.E. from the house of Hermes. It's a classy effervescent lemony scent with woodsy notes and a hint of cardamom and/or green tea. Lots of character and somehow has a very passionate/sexual vibe during the drydown. An original bottle and it's refillable though I've never seen refills of this fragrance for sale anywhere.

This one doesn't stick around for very long. On me, it's lasting around 3-4 hours and then it's a pure skin scent for another 2-3 hours.

I'm a big collector and this by no means is my first or only well made, quality fragrance that doesn't last all day and that's just fine. Anyone wanting more longevity is probably wearing it to work during the day and the important thing to remember is that with any great fragrance, the first impressions you make that day, probably in the morning when you're freshly showered and shaven, are what people around you will notice and remember. Nobody wants to smell you all day. If you're more interested in smelling it on yourself and want to keep that vibe going, carry a small decant in your pocket and give the back of your hand a spray every few hours."

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Voyage d`Hermés is simple and complex at the same time for me. Have you already saw those pictures where you see an image and you can only see the other images that forms it if you pay attention on the details? Well, it`s how is Voyage d`Hermés for me. On the bigger scenario, the scent can be simply a fresh, green, musky scent, in a minimalistis style perfectly for being a scent representative of Hermés as a brand. But then, if you spray it liberally and pay attention to it as it develops on skin, you`ll see that this is a kind of moment where Ellena recapitulates elements that he has been perfecting so far. You see flashes of Angeliques Sous La Pluie, Terre d`Hermes, The Different Company Bois d`Iris, Eau des Merveilles. And while it`s reminiscent of previous works, the fragrance quotations are shaped in this green, musky accord, perfect for a summer day and with that soft, barely there, silk aroma that Hermés seems to be favoring now. If you love strong and dramatic aromas you`ll probably don`t see any fun on this, but if your style goes towards light scents with a subtle complexity, i recommend this one. As I said before, spray it liberally, it works much better and creates a more surrounding fragrance on skin."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Voyage d'Hermes is my first Hermes I've ever tried and my first scent by Ellena. I got this after falling in love at first sight with the bottle and because I wanted to feel as luxurious as the brand. From the bottle, the bitter citrus is almost overwhelming--it's a manly, spicy, green citrus and reminds me a bit of pine sol. After a few short moments on my skin, it opens up to reveal a very pretty floral hiding beneath it. The citrusy-woody-floral combo is very pleasant and takes me to some sunny spring morning. In terms of color, I smell a chartreusy lime green followed by almost carnation pink. It almost clashes, but I like that. However, from such a luxury brand and from such a notorious nose, I must admit I was ""underwhelmed"" in terms of sillage and longevity. I want an Ellena to be my signature scent, but this one doesn't quite make the cut."

Even if someone does not believe in magic, she or he is carrying a sense of fear towards it. Perfumes are most of the time relating to human souls in just about the same manner.
A perfume,liked or dislike, touches us from the inside of our beings. A perfume makes you feel something, be it good or bad. Perfumes are designed to affect your internal sense of mood; they are made to alter or even create your mood and sense of momentary being for certain time... From this perspective, perfumers are giant mood creators; or even souls' 'players'... So, should we talk about perfumes superficially anymore. For instance, if a perfume touches your inside creatively, remember not only the notes, but also the soul who designed it to delight you from innermost."

It's perfect to wear in warm weather, you want to feel classy but don't want to stand out too much, you just like to feel fresh and classy, then Voyage is just perfect.

It's not overpowering, not offensive, but still unique at the same time.

It takes a very special kind of balance to make a unique scent so versatile.

This one is definitely not the weak one, at least on my skin. The most natural and fresh fragrance I own, I just adore it! :)"
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","The perfumer Jean-Claude Ellena uses travels as inspiration, a state of mind. You can see this in several fragrances from the brand.

In this fragrance, there's something located between peace and freedom, represented in the ad campaign by the encounter between the White Dove and the wild horse, which runs through several landscapes. Some say the bottle was inspired by a pocket magnifying glass, with its container in aluminium, but I own another perception, because I can only see the modernity of USB flash drives that are sold in this same style. The high-tech side speaks louder this time, though both are portable and made to carry on trips. Mere coincidence.

It counts on citrus (amalfi lemon) and spicy notes (ginger, cardamom and coriander), in the output; Green notes, Hedione (chemical compound that has floral nuances) and tea in the heart; Woody and musky notes, reinforced by the presence of Iso E Super (chemical molecule that has nuances of cedar, vetiver, crystalline and slightly ambery aroma) in the base.
It's another unisex fragrance and the results demonstrate diverse experiences, mainly, on the skin of women. On my skin, it has a great citrus output, which only grows to a more synthetic aroma with soapy aspect. I've seen many comparisons with Déclaration, by Cartier, but I don't agree, because the outcome of both, at least on me, it is not similar. In my perception, it remembers more the elegant and simple style of Bvlgari Pour Homme.

It has a very poor sillage, but it lasts forever. I can see this fragrance as a wildcard for the warmer weather because it can be worn without fear and in several occasions."

Nothing to dislike here. Voyage D'Hermes is a classy scent a woody, musk, spiced citrus, reminiscent of Cartier Declaration with prominent cardamom and fresh citrus. I wouldn't have thought it to be everyone's cup of tea, but with the relative popularity of scents like Dior Homme sport lemon & spice is a popular combo. I'm a real spice fan and as such enjoy this fragrance. I don't think it's as intrusive as the Cartier and slightly more wearable.The verdict then? It doesn't inspire me but I'd wear it.
Great for spring and summer, Hermes deliver yet again."

Jean Claude Elena's ubiquitous sour grapefruit note is not very appealing to me. So the fact that amalfi lemon is substituted for grapefruit here makes this immediately more appealing."

I happen to have both small quantities of Voyage EDT and EDP. One day I tested them on either arms to compare which side I might like better. Very difficult! In a nutshell, they are definitely related but still different enough. EDT comes across way more citrussy than the EDP, in one word Gin & Tonic! I do not fully agree with people saying longevity is poor, however I cannot say whether the EDT or EDP lasts longer, they just carry a different feel for me. In fact, the EDT seems to have one particular component that really seems to make it cling to my skin like there is no tomorrow, could be the famous Iso E. I love both the EDT and EDP - perhaps the EDT is even more refreshing in summer so you could reserve the EDP for winter. EDP turns into a much more warm and ambery skin scent."

Unique. A very first fragrance that made me think that I would LOVE to smell it on a man. It's spicy and clean, that Hermes cologne note is present. But I love it on me instead ;)

The only scent that makes me think of Wes Anderson's movies, ('Darjeeling Limited', the opening scene in Paris), expensive (yet simple and organised) travel, and extravagant, 'member's club only' lifestyle that most of us are unlikely to have.

I love this characteritic brush-stroke of Ellena: the ""almost-sweetness"" I detected in his other creations like L'Eau d'Hiver and Un Jardin Mediterranee (among others)...they seem to go towards sweetness with determined steps, just to stop before really getting there, I love the tension that this effect creates!

There is a very subtle velvety rose to the dry down (imagine a lemon yellow rose), with warm woods (cedar?) resonating. Eventually becomes powdery and amber-like over time. This is a very warm, uplifting scent. I have noticed numerous reviews indicating best use of this scent for summer, perhaps due to the brightness of the opening Amalfi lemon.

When the middle note sets in, I smell bittersweet ginger, comforting and powdery. I love that is it unisex, can totally be the perfume for a couple into each other, adopting this scent like their love. Unisex perfumery is an oxymoron, masculine and feminine. Both sex wearing it should be the active type close to nature, outdoorsy, I don't see coach potatoes wearing this. On a man I see a natural, smart, hipster, surfer type with a quiet personality, patient and kind to women with a soft side, yet confident of his masculinity, I also see it on a homosexual with an artsy side. If your macho skip this. I like the smell on a man mixed with its natural strong manly odours it accentuates/balance with his masculinity instead of overpowering it like boring musky man perfumes. On a women I smell confidence, sporty, none girly, wanting to stand out among other women,who got sick of floral and fruity scent wanting to be a new person, wanting to shock instead to attract(with common vanilla or sweet scents),and try different things maybe after a breakup and wanting to explore the world full of danger, therefore Voyager?"

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","If you can find a 3.3oz/100ml real bottle for around $60-$70 then it's highly worth it. Overall, the sillage on skin (0-10) is about 5.5, longevity on skin (0-10) is about 6, and projection on skin (0-10) is about 6.5. On the flipside, if a man or woman wore this but spraying undergarments like tanktop or bra with 4-sprays and 2-sprays behind each ear; WATCH OUT!!! Everyone will love crossing paths with you cause it's that darn amazing.

Clean scent with a powdery citrus, some spices, and a light-woodsy accord, hardly any floral at all, but if you sniff around long enough a person can sense a ginger note (maybe) although its not listed.

As far as people stating synthetics like comments regarding Hermes-Voyage eau de toilette; For the record, I own creed, cartiers, real aged oud attars, tom ford private blends collections, and few other worthy scents... Not by a long shot is this a terrible fragrance. Im actually on my 2nd bottle in 2yrs and its enjoyable.

Remember its all depending on the method of application. Highly concentrated HARSH-CHEMICAL scents will last longer on the skin and no telling whatever else its doing too. Hermes is not a seller of harsh-chemicals and therefore expect to apply this on undegarments such as tank-tops and bras for longer wear. In addition, fragrances react different depending on weather (cold-cool-warm-hot) and body temperture.

*hope thats not too long! :)"
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Voyage d`hermes is a woody fragrance with fresh and citrus-fruity overtones.It is a simple,subtle and very well composed fragrance.

Main top note consists of angelica leaves and citruses, the middle is juniperberry, and the base notes are mix of cedarwood, sandalwood and white musk.

The most prominent note in Voyage d`hermes is Juniperberry, althought nobody mentioned it.It is real smell of juniperberry.Very natural,I can claim this because I had a lot of opporunities to memorize this smell as i was picking juniperberries from the nature almost every summer.I know the nature very well as it is part of my life.I live near mountain and often go picking different kind of herbs.Voyage d`hermes is nature in a bottle fragrance.When I smell it, remaind me of the smell in the morning when a go trought junipers to pick the juniperberries.

Slightly wet herbs,slightly earty,the smell of juniperberries and the smell of juniper nidels and the air in the morning sun.And, just add water when you are thirsty and that is Voyage d`hermes.

This fragrance for me is pretty original on it`s own.It doesn`t last long,the same as the moment in nature doesn`t last long.It is meant to energise you and resfresh your sences, it is not a sillage monster to go clubbing.Voyage d`hermes is to enjoy the nature.To have part of nature always with you.To love the life.

I highly recomend Voyage d`hermes to those people with deeper soul and introspection, who often find the joy in small things and moments in life."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Voyage d'Hermes is a weird scent for me. It's not my usual ultra-feminine floral type, but it's very interesting and somehow comforting.
It's true as said before that it really reminds of Cartier Declaration or Eau de Cartier or some Hermes fragrances.
They all have something in common with a citrus-aromatic opening as if lemon and herbs wear crushed together, then spices like cinnamon or cloves but quite diluted, not too much East-type then a woody base with lovely ambery tones or should I say synthetical ambery notes, only slightly powdery with an allure of woody fabric conditioner, it screams: ""I'm coming out of the shower, worn a cashmere pull and a pair of black jeans and ready for you baby, but with class""
All in all is a very classical scheme for a perfume but with an eye blink to modernity and acceptability.
It's a kind of smell that has become kind of an acquired taste around and a safe smell, half warm half clean, cosy but not sexual and trans-gender.
Worn by a woman it gives some warmth without being too frilly or too femme-clichè.
Worn by a man is a style of non-aggressive rather intellectual man."

This is another watery, bland Hermes perfume, like Jardin Sur le Nil, another perfume with beautiful notes, but turns out very bland and watery. This EdT mostly smells like citrus. I smell cardamom only for the first few seconds, and I certainly don't get any impression that there is tea here. This smells similar to many other citrus/fresh perfumes and is pretty unremarkable. For cardamom and tea notes, there are many other wonderful options like Jacomo #8 and Malabah."

It brings associations with a sunny pine forest by a waterfall.

It was quite difficult to choose between EDT and EDP. In EDT crispy atmospheric opening notes are long lasting, while EDP turns into cozy woody warmth within an hour. Both are inspiring and lively, but EDT is more energetic."

It goes on bright and citrusy like the cheerful start of a vacation but then almost entirely disappears a couple of hours later - like your excitement when you've discovered the Carnival cruise ship you've booked passage upon developed power and waste disposal problems.

Voyage comes in a clever swivel travel bottle that you can throw into your luggage for the TSA employee to steal during his inspection. (I lost a point and shoot camera that way once.)

A nice fragrance, but, really, Jean-Claude Ellena, the perfumer for Hermes, needs to work on longevity. This juice is like their d'Orange Verte - a great, light, citrus scent but gone in no time at all. For the price point, this represents bad value for the dollar.

Second wearing: Here's how to make it last - don't spray it on your skin, spray it on your cotton shirt. I put it on at 6:15 AM this morning and I can still smell it at 3:15 PM."

The main problem with this fragrance is that it disappears after 5 minutes completely. people around me could not smell it on my skin. I had to go back to the store were I bought it and they were very friendly and allowed me to replace it.

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","The moment I donned Hermès VOYAGE D'HERMES, I was reminded of BVLGARI POUR HOMME, which I recently reviewed. They are both light and clean and tea-like, and quite pleasant, if not very thrilling. There's not a lot to say, to be honest, because the blend is quite subtle. To some, subtlety equates to boredom, but not to me. Sometimes I like a low-key, light but friendly scent such as this.

BVLGARI POUR HOMME and VOYAGE seem to use the exact same clean musky base, and it dominates both perfumes. The big difference to my nose is that VOYAGE offers the lightest dusting of cardamom, which is one of my favorite notes, so of course I like this composition better than BVLGARI POUR HOMME for that reason alone.

I have been curious about this creation since its launch but never had the opportunity to test it until today--I must have had ""other priorities"" during previous visits to Sephora, which is where I obtained this sample.

I would definitely consider adding a bottle of VOYAGE to my collection, and I admit to being swayed in that direction by the bottle itself, despite the fact that I probably don't need any more ""twenty-first-century open-office-ready"" scents.

When reading reviews on Voyage d'Hermès it surprised me, how few people commented on the prominent cardamom note, which to my nose, overpowered all other notes.
I may confuse other notes with cardamom, but when referring to Voyage d'Hermès in the future, it will always remain 'that cardamom fragrance'.
The woodsy notes come up much later. Quite surprisingly, the tea note finally becomes dominant in the drydown! Quite the interesting chameleonic scent.
Too bad today is a cold Jnauary day, while this supposedly is a terrific one for a sweltering hot summer day. I won't have that option again as it will be sent out to another young parfumista, who would love to test it.

It bring to mind clear image of a man reading a newspaper on a street cafe in Milan. He is dressed sharply in a white pinstripe suit and two tone shoes with metal tips. Ice clinks in his glass as the gin and citrus cocktail, ribboned in yellow, green and orange fruit peels, slowly melts."

As I usually do before deciding on unloading a ton of money for a folly, I sprayed it on a piece of cardstock. On Sunday. At first I got a very sharp scent of pepper. Very sharp. Almost repulsive. Lots of pepper. And something else. Something making it it positively eatable. (Hey! You want that - once in a while...) Not sugary - por favor, - not sweet but pungent and sharp. Cardamon husk (the green part) but not the seed. And nothing, at all, not a whiff, not a faint scent, not a thought, of anything citrus. Nor flower. Any. Green, but not green tea.

Monday. It started settling. Still sharp, still very peppery, but a lot more inviting.

Tuesday. - almost 60 hours after spraying -. This perfume is just the gift that keeps on giving! The dry-down is so much more than the top notes. Now I smell AND taste the clove. Clove! Like some very small dark brown spicy candy we used to eat in the 1960's and 1970's to mask the smell of illicitly puffed cigarettes. And a faint chocolate smell. Now it is po-si-ti-vely eatable. Like chocolate filled with liqueur.

My next step is to try it on... If it lasts, its a 'must have'...."

A fresh burst of citrus and light flowers but fades so,so fast to a faint hint of faint woody cedar...and then, poof, it's gone.
I won't get it again for that reason sadly- oh and the bottle design is pretty annoying..."

There are some similarites with this and Apres les Mouson. Where as Apres Les Mouson is all about the wet forests of Southern India, Voyage D'Hermes conujures up images of Tea Plantations in Assam

Thank you for making such a excellent fragrance. Ok, this is what I like about it...it's a bit of mystery mixed with fresh citrus and a touch of musk. Also like the fact that it's unisex. Too feminine doesn't fit me. I love it."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Starts with warm juniper/cardamom aroma – and I find myself in a wood paneled room of an estate house: somewhere where traditions and memory od generations are almost tangible. That’s a very deep scent, no hint of sweetness in it, bit no sharpness and sourness. Comforting, but not relaxing, that is I want to go out and explore the world rather than lie under the blanket with a book. The best weather for this scent would be foggy fall or cool summer. I wear this interchangeably with Angeliques Sous La Pluie by Frederic Malle, only Angeliques… is really great when it’s raining, Voyage when it’s dry.
Also I can't complain about the staying power - 5 hours is more than enough for me."

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","This is a typical Ellena creation. Light, simpel and transparant, yet refined and elegant. I`m not a fan of the first 30 minutes. The green citrus notes reminds me of Gin & Tonic. After 30 minutes the fragrance gets woodier, and the musc and soft spicy notes are more prominent. This is the best part. Voyage d Hermes is a light and fresh scent for all occasions, yet it`s very refined. Great as a signature fragrance. Thumbs up from me!

(I`m very cuorious if the edp version is very different!)"
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Gives new meaning to the word fresh. I have not smelled such a delicious blend of fresh sophistication in only a way Jean Claude Ellena could come up with. The opening is a lemony grapefruit citrus blast that smooths its way to a spicy warm woody base. A very clean scent that may come across as to ""safe"" for some but I absolutely love it. Extremely versatile as well. In the words of Katie Puckrik....""smooooooooooth"". The EDP is great too. EDT works well for the day. EDP I would probably use on a cooler summer night. Two thumbs WAY UP!"
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Voyage is lovely, fresh and delicate, but longlasting. Its citrus and spicy opening is mouthwatering, and as it develops it leaves on the skin this elegant note of green and woods. Just before fading away it makes me think of incense despite the fact incense is not listed in the composing notes. I love it, I think it is a perfect fragrance for spring and summer. It makes me feel elegant and fresh, but in a different way."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Great fragrance, longevity is good (not great) and the scent is perfect for summer. I love the subtle but clear spices, and the citrus notes are lovely. It is perfectly blended and sets great on the skin. I've used it for most of the spring. It's a great casual fragrance and is perfect for a night out with friends, or for a spring/summer day with your significant other. I personally prefer this EDT to the Parfum. Definitely try this one out, I'm confident you will enjoy it's casual, but satisfying scent!"
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']",The description led me to have high hopes but this just doesn't work. The components don't blend and there's an overall antiseptic quality. Maybe it's better on other people.
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","I find Voyage d´hermès is an amazing fragrance. Don´t make the mistake to judge it by the first impression. On the skin it is something completely different. I get very much out of it. Unlike with many other fragrances, I can´t say what ingredient I smell, it animates my imagination. I always can smell a horse rug, or like the back of a horse smells after some activity ( really great). Then I can smell grassland, with some herbs and sweet flowers ( very discreet ) and hay. But everything is very smooth, subtle and I only get a hint of it ( except for the horse rug). Projection is really good, but lasts not so long ( about 2-3 hours). Longevity is good on skin (4-6 hours) but great in clothes ( days). But the best thing is, that the smell does not change at all with the time, it just stays as good as in the beginning, until it is gone."

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Unbelievably light in the most complimentary way. Starts off with a squeeze of lemon and warms into a smooth blend of lightly spiced wood with a touch of sweet. I sprayed some on and caught a sniff and had to commit, it's a daytime scent that pleases."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Voyage d`Hermes

Starts out masculine with warm spicy citrus.
Once the scent is settled, on my skin, I smell a mixture of 3/4 Un Jardin Sur Le Nil and 1/4 Un Jardin Apres la Mousson.

The masculinity is femininized later by romantic florals. The spice fades, a green note matures. The citrus lingers .. very fresh, clean .. becomes powdery in the end during the dry down.

Voyage d`Hermes has low projectivity although--like other Hermes perfumes--never fails to last.

Soft citrus, gentle fresh spice, and light vegetal floral. Voyage d`Hermes .. is charming indeed.

Now I must confess that I am to choose between Voyage d`Hermes and Un Jardin Sur Le Nil. You can probably tell .. I am torn .

(｡◕‿◕｡)

My apologies Voyage .. I decided to shack up with Un Jardin Sur Le Nil .."

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']",Great news! Finally Hermes will launch Voyage d'hermes in EDP concentration on 1 February! Amazing:)
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Love it Love it!
Even though it took time for me to get used to it (it was a long way) - but worth it..
It's a sophisticated perfume (characteristic to Hermes). It reminds me of pine, citrus, spices & green tea.
I wish if it only stayed on longer."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Voyage is really one of the best quality perfumes I have ever smelled. I smell nothing remotely artificial on it, on the contrary, it is very very natural, IMHO.
It's a classy, elegant, refined but thick and full and rich perfume.
I wouldn't have known this fragrance if a dear member here (Montezuma) wouldn't have sent me a sample of it.
I fel in love with it the first moment I smelled it!
I don't like cardamom very much but this perfume is one of my most favorite, I LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!

I know many people find it more masculine but I just fail to see it this way! And I am a woman-ish, classical woman who wears mostly flowery scents and dresses instead of trousers.
Then, I guess, it's probably a matter of skin chemistry."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Voyage is an artificial smelling capsicum and synthetic musk blend that lasts forever if you spray it on clothes.

Personally I hate it, but if you are a lover of bell pepper type scents or the idea of pepper meets clean (synthetic musk) sounds like your ticket, you may want to give it a try. It does smell nice on first whiff.

Voyage reminds me of its sister Eau de Gentiane Blanche, which also smells nice, which I also dislike. Perhaps like Gentiane Blanche, Voyage would smell nice on someone else, in passing.

The bottle design is distinctly pointless bordering on annoying."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","First off, the bottle does nothing for me. Just plain awkward/ gimmicky (IMO).

Second off, I love Hermes. 24 Faubourg, Terre and Eau des Merveilles (amongst others) are high up on my list of faves.

That being said, I'm torn here. I'm liking it but I not loving it.

Really nice day wear (good for the office/ outdoors), and best for the warmer climate months.

Appealing opening with the Amalfi lemon (love)reeling you in. The green springs and lays the ground work. The base notes of musk and wood give it some heft.

Yes, similar to Terre (coincidence?!?) but lacking its depth and class.

Sillage is descent but it doesn't go the distance in length.

Unisex, but borders more homme then femme."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Good fragrance but overpriced:
Bottle: 5/10 (could be better)
longevity: 6/10
sillage: 8/10
scent: 10/10 (it reminds me Declaration Cartier)"
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Amazing and absolutely mine! I've got a 2ml tester and this is 2ml of happiness!
I smell the citruses (lemon) in the beginning, which accompanies woodsy pine notes (it reminds me of cedar, juniper & cypress). And in the end these woodsy-citrus accords join with soft, warm & delicate sweet floral notes.
In cold weather I feel more citruses, but when it's warm - Voyage makes me feel bliss: sensual woodsy & floral notes rule the roast.
The tester I had isn't stable, but may be it because this is tester, & may be I put too little."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Finally I bought this one. Yeah, it's not sillage or projection monster and doesn't have an impressive longevity, but, God, the smell is to die for! This scent is pure aromatherapy, very relaxing and soothing. It feels like going through coniferous wood. Smell of happiness!"
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']",OMG it's soooooo good!!!!!
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","I tested this perfume today. It has hints of Eau de Mervilles, which I love. I just bought EDM the other day after wanting it for a month. Voyage is spicy and citrusy like EDM. However, on me it has better sillage and longevity on me. I ended up trying Voyage today because I went back to the store to see if they had EDM lotion so that I can layer that scent. I tested Voyage, went for a run in the hot sun, took a shower and I can still smell it over 3 hours later. So I was surprised to hear people say that it does not have longevity. I wish my EDM had this kind of longevity, because by far it is the best scent.

Voyage is peppery, citrus and sensual. Again, very much like EDM.

Just goes to show that different scents react differently on with individual body chemisty.

I will agree with other reviews that it is a bit too pricey considering the lack of originality."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']",It gives me the sense of light and plain air in springtime..I love the green notes

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","This scent has nothing of what Hermés should give to its high class clientele: it's not original, not long lasting, not special in any way. It does not have anything new, anything to be innovative, anything close to the other items from this brand, perfumes included. Hermés missed a great opportunity. Or they are aiming to a cheaper company vision."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Voyage d'Hermes is (on my skin) a one-note cardamon scent shaken into a glass of some watered-down lemonade. I get the salad note that Grottola spoke of, but someone perhaps knocked a spice rack into said salad. Not a particularly fantastic Voyage, and surprisingly flat for an Hermes."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","I like Ellena, and I love Hermes. I don't like Voyage. Why? Well, for one, I find it too damn synthetic. It has that same ""salad"" citrus accord that Sur le Toit has, and I find it to be a chemical, lifeless type of citrus that's popping up in more and more fragrances these days. Another problem is that there's a strange ""wet dog"" note in the top (probably caraway) that kinda puts it off for me. Eventually, within half an hour or so, these two problem notes settle down to a nice woody tea note ala Bulgari Pour Homme, but by then the fragrance is pretty weak.

Sorry, everyone. I really do love Hermes, but I'll have to pass on this offering. That being said, I look forward to future Hermes creations. You may very well enjoy this one!"
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","With Voyage, Jean Claude Ellena creates a more populist, marketable perfume. More complex than his usual compositions, with woods, musks, and aquatic citrus, it has a lot in common with popular aquatic colognes for men.

But the balance of Voyage is more refined than other more popular brands. It is not cloying or overpowering like so many others. Somehow, even in this very commercial scent, Ellena's signature is there: purity, clarity, and the inspiration of nature.

The marketing team recognized that they could capitalize on the elegant masculinity of this perfume, hence the craftsmanship of the equestrian-inspired bottle, and the sense of adventure inherent in the name.

If you like the aesthetic of Armani, Ralph Lauren, Azzaro, Boss, etc., Voyage d'Hermes takes it to a higher level of refinement and good taste."
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","As a woman, I love to wear this scent as it gives me a more sophisticated, daytime, summer scent. I love to wear it on a busy day at work when I need to look and feel professional.

I agree with the below comments about how beautiful the bottle design is...but I kinda HATE the bottle - I have the 100mL and it is too big for my hands. It is a real effort to spritz it.

Unisex scent - Man bottle"

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","It's between burberry the beat and cartier declaration.
Nice cardamom spicy smell joined by citrus and woods,there is some sweetness from lemon ,like they used lime or some fruity note.
First time i tried it,it gave me cardamom and only cardamom ,weather was very warm then.
It's light,fresh,naturel with quality ingredients.
Can be worn by women but better for men IMO.

Edit:
Third test: there is something wrong with it,spices may give a strange smell.....i dont know!!"
Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","The 1st time I tried this, I was overwhelmed by the ginger. I was ready to write this one off as the 1st Hermes fragrance that I didn't like. But I know better than that. This time, everything was JUST right. It's crisp, fresh and airy - Hermes style. If Terre d`Hermes is the earth a la Hermes, then Voyage d`Hermes must be the air AND sea equivalent. Once the initial blast of ginger mellows, this is pure bliss until the end. The sillage is ""come here and get seduced"" and the longevity is pretty decent on my ""I love Hermes"" skin. Another winner from Hermes."

Voyage d'Hermes Hermès (unisex) ~ 2010,"['warm spicy', 'citrus', 'green', 'aromatic', 'woody', 'fresh', 'musky']","Voyage it's probably not a groundbreaking release, but at least is a quite honest and well refined composition. While it's not particularly outstanding as a fragrance, it is surely outstanding among the latest compositions by CJ Ellenà as a gentle and very light spicy-woody-musky scent that's incredibly versatile. A lime and cardamom opening that's pretty enjoyable turning into a peppery-woody-musky drydown that's not particularly original but still well executed and comfortable.

Easy to wear, unpretentious and very minimal yet well refined. At least it doesn't make me run up the hill...a good fragrance to look for when you want to mingle with the crowd mantaining a bit of discreet elegance.

Concentre d'Orange Verte Hermès (unisex) ~ 2004,"['citrus', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'aromatic', 'green', 'sweet', 'patchouli', 'herbal', 'amber']","The fragrance is rather straightforward fresh bitter citrus, I'd say it more reminds me of petitgrain or at least more of bitter orange than sweet orange. In the bottle it's a blend of citrus, cedar and patchouli, while on my skin it remains as a mixture of citrus and basil, it stays distinctly bitter for around 20 minutes, after that becomes more subtle and fresh. The fragrance is both moderate in the matter of longevity and sillage, the light character makes it more suitable to daytime and warmer seasons. The fragrance is all right, especially for those who like clean citrus notes very much."

Concentre d'Orange Verte Hermès (unisex) ~ 2004,"['citrus', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'aromatic', 'green', 'sweet', 'patchouli', 'herbal', 'amber']","Even as a young child, I always liked the scent of oranges in the summertime. This is why I have been super excited to snatch Hermes Concentre D’Orange Verte at an affordable price.

Even before I had purchased this perfume, I knew that its weakest points were poor projection and longevity, but I couldn’t care less. Finding out just how natural was the aroma of green oranges couldn’t get out of my mind.

Here are my 5 quick takes:

- The best orange-based perfume of all time
- A citrus aromatic fragrance with average longevity
- Created by Jean Guichard in 2004
- Best used during warmer seasons on any occasion
- Poor performance keeps it from getting bigger appreciation

Hermes Concentre D’Orange Verte is a great citrus-based fragrance for an affordable price, but with poor performance.

I believe that those who enjoy the art of perfumery will enjoy this perfume the most, as it tells a beautiful story, and refreshes your mind.

Concentre d'Orange Verte Hermès (unisex) ~ 2004,"['citrus', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'aromatic', 'green', 'sweet', 'patchouli', 'herbal', 'amber']","I get a very natural zesty orange peel scent very much like peti grain but cannot pick out any other notes as shown in the note breakdown, perhaps thats becasu eit blended so well but seriously nothing else stands out.
Its very refreshing and works best hot a hot summers day or evening if you want to smell like orange zesty peel, not that there is anything wrong with that as orange zesty peel smells wonderful!
it is a rather pleasant scent and I like this but I do not love it, I find (on my skin) it turns into a skin scent after 30 min so you do need to spray on your clothes for the longevity and sillage to last a longer.
All in all a decent refreshing basic linear scent that smells extremely natural and refreshing. :)"
Concentre d'Orange Verte Hermès (unisex) ~ 2004,"['citrus', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'aromatic', 'green', 'sweet', 'patchouli', 'herbal', 'amber']","Super nice, the opening smells like a slightly less green, slightly more orangey version of xerjoff renaissance. It's a shame it doesnt last as long as renaissance up to 10-12 hours, especially the citrus. This lasts about 6 hours and has a mild silliage but is a bit more reasonable price-wise. Compared to other citruses at this price I can honestly say nothing has it beat for the opening, but after 30 mintues the cedar turns sour and the citrus is gone, kinda reminds me of cool water. This fragrance has such high quality that it's being compared to the big dogs and that deserves some credit. 7.5/10"
Concentre d'Orange Verte Hermès (unisex) ~ 2004,"['citrus', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'aromatic', 'green', 'sweet', 'patchouli', 'herbal', 'amber']","Absolutely the best citrus scent I have ever smelled. It blows every other citrus out of the water. Reminds me of a mint mojito but much more orange/citrus. I just wish it lasted longer and projected more but that's really an issue with every citrus scent. I still plan on purchasing it when summer comes around because it just smells that good and isn't super expensive. It's sunshine in a bottle. Very unique with a lot of character.

If you love citrus scents and just care about smell, go for this one but if longevity and projection are that important try Chanel Allure Homme Sport. It's more floral but still a great citrus scent and projects + lasts more than any other citrus I have tried, which really isn't saying much but just my two cents."
Concentre d'Orange Verte Hermès (unisex) ~ 2004,"['citrus', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'aromatic', 'green', 'sweet', 'patchouli', 'herbal', 'amber']",This is one of my favorite citrus fragrance. For me all products by Hermes are classy and sophisticated. This is a clear example!
Concentre d'Orange Verte Hermès (unisex) ~ 2004,"['citrus', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'aromatic', 'green', 'sweet', 'patchouli', 'herbal', 'amber']","In years past, Concentre d'Orange Verte could have been the standard bearer for me. Not necessarily in terms of being a everyday chosen wear, but more so abstract and emotionally - an olfactory illustration of an ideal “day in the life of.” But here on the cusp of what seems predetermined to be a metaphorically cold and dark Winter, it has become a flame in the darkness that signifies bittersweet longing. I’ve heard and read the Portuguese have a word for the same wistful array of emotions, seemingly at play against one another, that this fragrance evokes in me: Suadade.

I am reminded of an afternoon of cooking, an activity I truly love, but one I don’t get to throw myself into often these days. The everyday meals I make for myself are usually lackluster, made to strike a balance between optimizing value, nutrition, and ease and speed of preparation. Although I am easy to please, it’s really just a way to placate myself as I am rarely impressed by this artless, pragmatic approach.

But cooking for friends, that’s a very different game. That’s where the passion comes out, and my confidence and reliance on the senses become paramount to the moment. I ascend to a trance-like rhythm. The process is as meaningful as the end product, both of which are treasures in their own rights. And the creature of devotion that I am, I am reticent to stray from the tried and true flavors I love the most, so these occasions are routinely dominated by fresh citrus and fresh herbs.

Concentre d'Orange Verte is the essence of a summer evening’s dinner party. The whole experience - lovingly laboring over the ingredients while the sun goes down, and sharing the spoils of one’s efforts with friends well into the night. This is an unapologetically simple citrus and basil, perfectly blended as if by accident, as if it were wafting from a freshly used cutting board. It projects a sort of joie de vivre - the perfect blend of the generosity and inherent warmth of high quality friendship and a mutual appreciation for the experience of just spending a wonderful evening together.

I have been keeping a decant of this in my pocket for the past few months, occasionally taking it out, resting the nozzle on my upper lip, inhaling deeply, and feeling the rush of dopamine flooding my bloodstream. It is intensely beautiful, and some days lately I feel it’s all I have. I must confess, though, that in a strange way I find myself somewhat grateful for today’s struggles - were it not for the ongoing isolation and amplified sorrow, I never could have appreciated the dreamlike memories and the hope for the future that Concentre d'Orange Verte stirs inside me.

Citrus and basil. So simple that it almost invites being taken for granted. But a yield far greater than the modest recipe suggests."
Concentre d'Orange Verte Hermès (unisex) ~ 2004,"['citrus', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'aromatic', 'green', 'sweet', 'patchouli', 'herbal', 'amber']","On the surface, this was a great idea by Hermes to produce a stronger and longer lasting version of their much loved Eau d’Orange Verte. Sadly, they have changed the actual scent significantly enough for these two fragrances to require different ratings and reviews. If you’re thinking of picking this up because you love the Eau and want a stronger version of the same scent then, sadly, Hermes have not managed to achieve that.

From the first blast, the same lovely orange note from the original is present, however it’s paired with a hefty backbone of cedar wood and even the mildest whiff of a pungent earthiness which evidently must be patchouli. In fact, the overall green effect of the original – which feels or smells like a garden to my nose, of thick, leafy greenery – is more subtle to my nose. Oddly, I think I smell something like basil more prominently in the original - despite basil being listed as a note for the Concentre on fragrantica and not for the Eau. Fortunately, this greenery comes out in the mids but it’s still overpowered by the cedar and that ‘orange verte‘ effect of the original is sadly dulled by the dusty wood aroma. Likewise, the citrus is less prominent or dominant in this fragrance, to the point I would consider this a cedar fragrance first and foremost, particularly as the fragrance progresses. In terms of the citrus, I smell more lemon than in the original, too, to the point where I’d say orange and lemon are equally strong – another difference from the original.

The overall effect is to produce something at least somewhat similar to the masculine flagship Terre d’Hermes. The similar orange top note, underpinned by a clear, clean, yet slightly overbearing woody base is not far from TdH at all. I would recommend it for those who want a more citric version of the TdH profile but who perhaps feel the Fraiche version from the line is still too woody – they really have created something of a ‘spectrum’ of scents within the same broad ‘palette’ of fragrance.

It’s still a decent and ‘chic’ smelling fragrance however it’s much less fresh – cedar isn’t a ‘dark’ wood by any means, but the ‘fuzzy’ feeling of synthetic cedar wood is not one I, personally, wish to wear on the hottest days of the year. As I consider the height of summer to be the ideal situation for wearing the original Eau d’Orange Verte, I’m not quite sure what the purpose of the Concentre could be given its much woodier note profile. Sadly, I often find cedar to be overbearing to the point of cloying and having worn this a few times in the summer, in the hottest weather, I found this to be the case when treating it like a fresh cologne. And oddly enough, I always got the feeling that there was something like vanilla in here – there’s a sweetness as it dries down and seeing amber listed absolutely makes sense. I think as a way of compensating for the cauterised orange accord, they’ve tried to simulate the feeling of a sweet, juicy note through the lifetime of the scent and, unfortunately, it is sweet but it doesn’t smell or feel exactly like an orange sweetness. It’s clearly an intelligent use of ingredients but, again, such a sweet accord in the base takes it away from the feeling of being a fresh, summer-friendly citrus fragrance. If you want this kind of sweetness then I’d recommend trying out Acqua di Parma’s Arancia di Capri, they aim for a similar sort of saccharine scent but it’s more overtly ‘orangey’.

That said, performance is better than the original and it still produces a nice enough skin scent. I get a good 6+ hours of longevity and projection is noticeably stronger, although this still is by no means a ‘strong’ fragrance – it sits fairly close to the skin, perhaps just under average in terms of projection.

Overall, however, the relatively minor differences between the two versions of Orange Verte are highly pronounced when trying them alongside one another i.e. one on each hand. The lovely, clean and musky drydown of the original has simply been replaced by a stronger and more powerful woody base in the Concentre and it veers it away from the fresh territory and in to something less appropriate for scorching heat. I do think the Concentre is more of a masculine aroma, where the original leans ever so slightly feminine, however that isn’t enough to sway me and I’m ultimately incredibly disappointed in the changes made from the Eau. This is still a good fragrance, however it’s very much one for lovers of the cedar note and while it has its charms in certain settings, I think it spoils the magic of the original and the disappointing (even cloying) experience of wearing the Concentre means I cannot suggest this over the original unless you like what you’ve just read.

I think the Eau is a better, more enjoyable, fresher, and more orange-based fragrance than the Concentre. Taking in to account price, performance, and the overall effect on skin, I would at the very least advise a sample of both versions before committing to a full bottle of either.

6.5/10: a disappointing development on the original if you’re craving ‘green orange’, however it’s still an enjoyable, classical aroma that is about as ‘safe’ as fragrances come. It’s probably more versatile than the Eau and certainly more male-friendly; it will still serve most people well enough as a fresh ‘pick me up’ kind of fragrance. So, it’s good enough, but I much prefer the Eau. The seemingly minor changes result in a significantly poorer fragrance in my opinion."
Concentre d'Orange Verte Hermès (unisex) ~ 2004,"['citrus', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'aromatic', 'green', 'sweet', 'patchouli', 'herbal', 'amber']","Beautiful. I wanted this on first sniff.
It is a very green citrus. The closest I can relate it to is like picking oranges or lemons from the tree, if you have ever gone cirtus picking. Citrus, citrus peel and oil, but also the sharp green scent of leaves and broken young branches.
It's quite nice. During the dry-down, a little more patchouli comes out, and the citrus takes a back seat to the patchouli and mint (dry, green mint, not sweet mint).
A wonderful, fragrant scent for Spring or Summer.
Unfortunately, the projection is pretty much non existent, and it becomes a skin scent fast. I have tended to prefer this one under circumstances where I can re-spray periodically, to experience that wonderful opening again.
However, it is very natural smelling and fresh. I can't really find fault with it. Just not the sort of scent you're going to wear to the club, or where you want to stand out. This is on the softer side; it doesn't scream at you."

Great summer fragrance. Does disappear rather quickly on me. I need to wear a few more times, but reminds me of FM's Bigarade Concentree. I know they are not from the same perfumer but wow. I need to do a side by side comparison.

I tried this and a sample decant of Terre d'Hermes Eau Tres Fraiche today. I'm leaning more to liking the TDH. Although, I'm not much of a fan of aquatic scents. So, for that reason, the nod may go to d'Orange Verte.

Both are great hot summer scents. I just need to spend more time with each."

Very nice but since I already have 3 different Merveilles flankers, it feels redundant to also purchase this cousin of theirs.

So uplifting and invigorating, it's almost therapeutic really. The orange here is amazing. So natural and fresh. I detect a little lavender sometimes too. I like this better than the non concentre version, it's a little bit more masculine with the extra mint and lasts a little longer, but not by much. Longevity and silage is its downfall here. I get 2 hours max. I purchased the smaller 1.6 oz bottle (beautiful frosted green glass) and it's small and discreet enough to slip into your coat pocket or purse (this is a unisex scent) for resprays throughout the day if needed. I'm also using the Hermes D'orange Verte body lotion as well, and its scent may actually last longer than the cologne itself! A shame about the longevity, but I still love it.

Most people overcomplicate the description. It is THE GO TO for an orange based scent. It is:

1) a soapy sweet orange with a dirty base
2) a classic - the origin for Terre d’Hermes
3) relevant today as it was in the 70’s

As it is a concentre it is obviously not as strong as an EDP however it is stronger than you think.

I have had this on my top 20 rotation for about 10 years and for a while was very much my signature. My interesting story is that during my childhood I had lots of free travel on Qantas (courtesy of my fathers job). I remember splashing the bottle of unmarked cologne supplied in the QAntas aircraft toilet liberally when ever I went to pee. Much to my parents amusement - they thought I was pretending to be grown up but it was as much because it had this amazing smell. It was a memory time stamp, especially refreshing when everyone in the plane smoked and you were stuck on board for upto 30 hours or more to get to London or Frankfurt. I just found out it was Hermes Eau D’orange Vert (it’s weaker cousin).

The kind of fragrance that has very few notes, smells natural and almost herbal. I keep thinking green here, but it does not smell green, odd.

It smells quality, but I do not get any of the natural sweetness of oranges or anything to round out the fragrance, which makes this almost seem a dry fragrance to me.

I would not recommend this to younger people or those who love full,deep or rich fragrances. I get 3 to 5 hours out of this and poor projection and sillage

I think Versace Fraîche,Terre d'hermes Très fraîche, Le labo bergamote 22 are better

Some of that is climate related, but mainly it’s my own outlook. Hermès Concentré d’Orange Vert (2004) supports this vision, but with incomparable European quality. It calls to mind the Côte d'Azur in high season with it’s endlessly deep orange liquor heart laced with an equally bottomless and lasting basil note infused with all the characteristics of the herb from crushed, green pesto to tarry, black anise seed. All of this seems to lie fixed on a sunny mat of cedar, patchouli, and amber, taking the sum total effect to the highest peak of summertime euphoria and holding it there indefinitely. Delightful and authentic in every way, this is my endless summer fragrance and vote for best of the best of Hermès alongside Terre d’Hermès and its earthy, burnt-orange addictiveness."

So much so that, as a female devotee, reading the comments below about it being ""not right"" on a woman made me feel personally slighted and a little punchy!

This is the big leagues. Truly a masterpiece. It has the real sharp zesty smack of bitter orange oil, the herbal/peppery edge of orange leaf, the freshness ofthe fruit's juice, the warm spicy woodiness of the orange tree itself, and that bewitching sweetness which evokes orange blossom. A passionate love from the very first time I sniffed it (and I am happy to admit that Terre d'Hermes is way too butch to work on me, and I also agree that Concentre would be sheer perfection if only it lasted longer, so I am not an all-out fangirl unable to see any fault in the house or this scent.)

What to say about it, that wouldn't be dull and obvious? Yeah, yeah, timeless classic, true unisex, unarguable quality, fine control of fine ingredients, all of that. But none of that does it justice. I'm not worthy! The best I can do is: this astonishing formula will take you on a glorious walk through a sun-dappled orange grove, wherever and whoever you are. Just try it. It is *wonderful*.

The only things even fit to come near it that I've tried are Bigarade Concentre (which does have better longevity, but is vastly more expensive), Noir Epices (which is much more macho and spicier, as well as pricier) and Shay&Blue Blood Orange, which has a wetter juicier feel but none of the wood or warmth, and no more longevity either).

Concentre d'Orange Verte Hermès (unisex) ~ 2004,"['citrus', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'aromatic', 'green', 'sweet', 'patchouli', 'herbal', 'amber']","This was my first Hermès and my first serious perfume purchase and it was love at first smell. Simply put this is THE summer fragrance by excellence !

The name conjures up the idea of something simple yet exquisite. A beautiful stroll through an unripe orange grove in the cool shade of the lush green fragrant orange leaves by a warm summer day.

As for the fragrance in itself, it opens up with a blast of electrifying zingy green citrus that feels like a cheerful blast in your face, a whack of optimism to shake you out of the humid torpor of a searing hot summer day ! It is followed by a mild minty coolness that eventually dries down to a very very delicate powdery black currant bud note. Very soft and distant. As you can imagine this perfume, which is really a cologne, performs very poorly in terms of longevity (basically gone after 1H) and sillage (dare I say nonexistent). But none of that matters because this is made to lovingly overindulge and splash, splash, splash and keep on splashing !

Unpretentious yet chic, cheerful yet sleek and elegant as you would expect from Hermes, this classic cologne will suit any person of any age and is guaranteed to put a big smile on your face. Note that this mood lifting quality also works in winter so don’t hesitate to take a whiff during the grey days of the cold season.

To sum up, Concentré d’Orange Verte is the smell of happiness."
Concentre d'Orange Verte Hermès (unisex) ~ 2004,"['citrus', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'aromatic', 'green', 'sweet', 'patchouli', 'herbal', 'amber']","This one unsettles me. The notes are fantastic, but I'm struggling with the combination. Gorgeous zesty orange that I want to bathe in! Scraped rind with juice and pulp! Unfortunately, there's a pesky dominant herbal mix interfering! Either alone would be great, but together there's a strange bitterness that makes my nose itch and want to separate the two. Like conjoined twins that hate each other.

And then the orange disappears. But by then, the basil/herb/amber accord has morphed into a pale powdery ghost. Not the original fresh just-clipped herbs that opened. Might be my skin. Hermes is one of my favorite houses - love Rocabar, Rose Ikebana, Caleche and more. But I've had problems with other scents like Un Jardin Sur Le Nil that doesn't smell on me like it does on others. Jean Guichard has made some legendary scents, Cacharel's Eden and LouLou, Calvin Klein's Obsession. So, I am leaning towards how my body chemistry reacts. Will have to try this one again when the weather warms!
Darn!"
Concentre d'Orange Verte Hermès (unisex) ~ 2004,"['citrus', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'aromatic', 'green', 'sweet', 'patchouli', 'herbal', 'amber']","I know I reviewed this one about 8 or 9 years ago when I discovered fragrantica. I remember buying this in duty free somewhere and it was my very first Hermès. Since then I went through hundreds of perfumes, yet the other day when I came face to face with this perfume I just had to buy it.... for old times sake’s I guess.
It’s beautiful.
Unisex but perfectly suitable for a woman with a strong spirit.
Bitter orange that manages not to be sour nor too peel zesty , mixed with garden mint and some sage for sweetness . I don’t smell lemon or citron at all. It’s definitely bitter green orange. Green , fresh, oozing with humidity and life like the rain forest, it’s longer lasting than most citrus scents I know. The frosty green bottle is a perfect match . The Patchouli is not strong at all, and that is good because I’m very particular when it comes to patch. After a while there seems to be a hint of rose, like young buds that are barely open. It feels invigorating.
Wonderful and not as simplistic as it seems. Silage is average, lasting power on clothes pretty good for a citrus, on skin you’re left just with clean freshness.
Recommended to people who like fresh , green and lively scents. Perfect in its genre."
Concentre d'Orange Verte Hermès (unisex) ~ 2004,"['citrus', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'aromatic', 'green', 'sweet', 'patchouli', 'herbal', 'amber']","This is a staple in my collection as one of my very favorite freshies.

I am really enjoying it on this balmy warm early Autumn day.
It is very sour tart orange, not like the sweet juice, but more like the orange peel with some lime added.
So it's very effervescent, and great performance for a fresh fragrance. It's like some Atelier Cologne frags, like Orange Sanguine.

The special thing that I like about this are the green notes, the dark green color of the bottle perfectly suits the dark leafy green foliage. So this is very unique and a fragrance of contrasts, that always makes a fragrance most satisfying for me.

Concentre d'Orange Verte Hermès (unisex) ~ 2004,"['citrus', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'aromatic', 'green', 'sweet', 'patchouli', 'herbal', 'amber']","Quite a pleasant citrus-orange minty green herbal spray that lasts for about 30 minutes before turning into a long lasting skin scent. I have a 15ml mini of this that I got in a gift set along with TDH as well as a couple of other Hermes fragrances. This is not a sexy fragrance in the least and is completely androgynous/unisex imo. However, this is not something that I personally enjoy ""wearing"" as part of my ""outfit"" for the day. This is much more of an aromatherapy, herbal soothing scent than it is a personal fragrance I think.

I do like spraying this one on from time to time however as it smells pleasant, is relaxing, helps concentration, lucid dreaming, etc. It somehow has a very ancient tribal age of aquarius Pleiades spiritual feel. If you're looking for a Hermes to wear out in real life, go for TDH. This one is appropriate for aforementioned spiritual types, maybe festival goers, hippies, etc. I'm joking. But it does smell nice, check it out of you're looking for a minty aromatic zesty orange fragrance."

I had it 25 years ago as a teenager and it smells just as good. It's kind of strange because I don't consider this to be a ""perfume"", and I don't buy it for the same purpose as I do with other perfumes. It's mostly the smell of orange to me. I can hardly detect other notes apart from basil. But that does not mean it's a bad thing. Orange and other citrusy essential oils are well known for their calming and relaxing properties. That's exactly how I feel after applying this: relaxed. And refreshed. It's a must for anyone who likes orange and a must have for anyone who wants to discover great Hermes classics."

For it’s next lifecycle, it is earthy bitter green.

The 1st few minutes are magic. I feel more lemon verbena than Orange, though Orange is no doubt present. The verbena note lifts up very soon, keeping the Orange note, which starts getting bitter, like over squeezing an orange. A green note starts showing up, which remains till the end, becoming drier and drier with time. The base is built up of strong cedar, which is the most persisting player (beside the green note) in Concentre d’Orange Verte.

Overall, it absolutely justifies its name. and like all Hermes it remains simple, aesthetic and unique.

My only disappointment is, it absolutely does not projects well after one or one and a half hours.

Sillage: Soft (As mentioned does not projects well after 1 Hour)
Longevity on My Skin: Approx 5 Hours (quite good as a cologne)
Longevity on Fabric: Approx 6 Hours
Occasion: Quite Versatile. One of my favorite for daily Office wear in humid summer days. This perfume grows more with sweat. You may wear it on Casual Affairs also. Not for Formal Occasions or Romantic Dates.

P.S: This Review is for the Cologne version of Concentre d’Orange Verte."
Concentre d'Orange Verte Hermès (unisex) ~ 2004,"['citrus', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'aromatic', 'green', 'sweet', 'patchouli', 'herbal', 'amber']","The best classical citrus along Eau de Guerlain (I exlude Eau Sauvage and Mugler Cologne since there entirely different continents on their own, also some colognes of the classic form).
Concentré goes immediately for an energizing bitter green blast paired with a very strong herbal/vegetal accord. The whole effect gives an extremely vivid green sensation, orange peel meets fresh grass, totally crisp with an earthy edge. Then the scent delves deeper in a more calming ambery territory, warm and comforting but remains fresh and elegant all the way.
Citrus fragrances are the quintessence of refreshment. Many of them however tend to either smell like kitchen cleaners or are so simplistic that one finds difficult to enjoy. There are cases though that they are done right and manage to grant you a long-lasting, distinctive classiness that is hard to beat. Concentré d'Orange Verte is one of them, a flavedo fresh masterpiece full of character."
Concentre d'Orange Verte Hermès (unisex) ~ 2004,"['citrus', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'aromatic', 'green', 'sweet', 'patchouli', 'herbal', 'amber']","Another gorgeous Hermes perfume. Straight away on spraying, there's a sense of how fresh and lovely this is. You get the orange and lemon smell you expect but there's also a brief moment of almond/amaretto for the first twenty minutes or so as well. Just occasionally you might get a whiff of that amaretto/almond note when you smell your skin. It's not a surprise to say that it is similar to the Eau D'Orange Verte but this concentre version brings out the verte and not just the orange whereas the original cologne is all about the orange. No complaints either way, just an observation. If you like one, you'll almost certainly like the other.

The basil and the cedar work together beautifully with the orange/lemon top notes and give it a depth that the Eau D'Orange Verte lacks. Think of it as the difference between holding the fruit up to your nose and smelling it and being in the orchard with the fruit still on the trees. The fruit is the dominant smell but the green notes are around it in the breeze.

It's a beautiful piece of craftmanship. I think it's suitable for any time of day or year or occasion. It is a soft scent and the projection is limited but it lasts a lot longer than a lot of the reviewers suggest. I sometimes wonder if the people who think it's gone after 45 minutes are spraying it from 100 yards away! You can just get 7 hours out of it altogether but it is a skin scent after three or four hours.

Concentre D'Orange Verte is lovely and refreshing and one of those scents that just make you feel better. It has that restorative quality that a well made citrus cologne should possess. I could also imagine using it with Terre D'Hermes, adding a little spray over it. I think this cologne has a certain flexibility that means it could be used with other citrus scents or ones with an earthy quality about them."
Concentre d'Orange Verte Hermès (unisex) ~ 2004,"['citrus', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'aromatic', 'green', 'sweet', 'patchouli', 'herbal', 'amber']","I love Hermes colognes, Eau d'Orange Vert was my first, and it became the standard by which I measured every other fragrance of this type. It took me some time to add Concentre d'Orange Vert to my collection, I'd read many reviews which said it was so similar to EOV that if you had one you didn't need the other. I find them to be similar only in the sense that they are the same type of fragrance. Concentre smells quite different on me, greener, and less orange. It's a sharper citrus at first, bitter in the very best way, then mellows just a bit, allowing tiny sparks of something sweeter (the amber maybe?) to pop up under the citrus. The longevity is surprisingly good, I've been wearing it 6 hours now, and am still getting a noticeable scent. Sillage is moderate. It's a pleasure to have it in my collection."

Such zest in the citrus that you could very well be peeling a fresh, ripe orange at this very moment. There is nothing synthetic about it at all.

A very unique scent, certainly won't be forgotten easily. Not suitable for the average female. You need a really whimsical and free-spirited character to wear this well, or to like it at all. Possibly a wild streak, together with that independent stubbornness.

I wouldn't claim that this isn't feminine at all. Sure, it works for guys too. But on a girl, now, that is something memorable. I suppose that Amélie Poulain might like it. Cheerful, quirky and lots of fun. Love it."

Orange > Orange... ORANGE ! That pure orange, that strong orange, but delicate too. A juicy one, full of sun. Yummy.

Verte > Yes, green. A green background, just behind the orange, without it, the orange would be boring, classic, I think. Calm, quiet, but present, just for the orange to be brought to arm, very well blended to make a greeny/spicy orange, a very special orange juice cocktail.

Concentre d' Orange Verte is also another MASTERPIECE which is best during the summer/fall days. The first time I sprayed it on my skin it was a rush of Orange/citrus scent which stays on that way over several hours. The aroma stimulates your senses and re energizes you becoming very up beat.
After the aroma of Orange settles ever so slightly then you are able to smell amber with a touch of patchouli.
This frag has a tremendous base of both basil and cedar combined with the top notes makes it a really impressive fragrance.

Luckily this fragrance can be shared between the sexes. It's fairly androgynous in its approach, and is neither too sweet nor too sharp.

I am surprised to discover that Concentre d'Orange Verte is in fact an EDT, not an EDC as I had previously thought it to be. It wears very much like a citrus cologne splash; watery, refreshing and crisp.

I have quite a fondness for realistic, juicy orange based fragrances. For some time I have enjoyed wearing L'Occitane's Ruban d'Orange during Summer, however since its discontinuation I have been searching for its replacement. Concentre d'Orange Verte certainly comes close.

It's the kind of fragrance I would reach for on a hot and humid afternoon. Concentre d'Orange Verte opens with a refreshing burst of citrusy orange, which is quickly followed by a subtle hint of green basil and clean cedar.

On my skin, the patchouli is barely evident. I wouldn't describe this fragrance as having any earthy or musty accords. It's fresh from beginning to end, and rather simplistic in this manner.

The longevity is fairly average for that of an EDT, and the sillage can vary from barely noticeable to moderately light. I probably wouldn't pay full price for Concentre d'Orange Verte, but I would like to add it to my collection at some point."

This fragrance is best worn on warm summer nights (Israeli summer nights are humid, hot and sticky and Concentre d`Orange Verte is better than air-conditioning for cooling down). The problem with this fragrance is that it's too strong when you apply it (almost like peeling an orange and getting it's juice in your eyes) and after the strong smell is gone (after 5 min) the rest fades away very quick, mostly after 20 minutes on my skin. but those 20 minutes are beautiful, very elegant. it reminds me of old airports in the 80s and I love it. I still don't really understand why I feel so low when I'm wearing it lately, maybe it has something to do with the fact that it's very bitter, or because I have bad memories from the time I used my first bottle of Concentre d`Orange Verte."

The real bitter, sour and refreshing aroma of green oranges, yet completely lacks longevity.

Very good projection, good sillage, but incredibly poor longevity, at least on my skin. I've worn this cologne in summer and also in winter and even if I used a very good quantity, aroma completely disappears after one hour. It's a pitty because it would be a very good edt if It had a far better longevity"
Concentre d'Orange Verte Hermès (unisex) ~ 2004,"['citrus', 'fresh spicy', 'woody', 'aromatic', 'green', 'sweet', 'patchouli', 'herbal', 'amber']","Concentré d´Orange Verte (CdOV) from Hermes is the ultimate joy maker. Its exceptional quality becomes obvious from the moment its first drops land on your skin. The zesty orange note combined with the mint have an invigorating effect on me. This explosion of tart freshness is, however, relatively short-lived as the scent calms down and proceeds to its less pronounced herbal-woody heart and base (including the notes of basil, patchouli and cedar).

From the longevity point of view, do not expect any wonders from CdOV. In fact, I find the adjective ""concentré"" a little misleading. It has to be understood in the context of traditional colognes. On my skin, CdOV turns into a skin scent rather swiftly. I do catch gentle whiffs every now and then, but this fragrance, just like any other eau de cologne, is meant to evaporate quickly in order to be reapplied (in generous quantities) a number of times during the day, which I´m delighted to do.

On balance, if you want to avoid smelling ozonic-aquatic-sporty in the heat of the summer but are rather looking for a refreshing, citrus-based summer scent, I wholeheartedly recommend this exquisite cologne from one of the finest present-day fragrance houses. Have fun!

P.S. I´d like to salute ""calyx93"" and ""Grottola"" for their truly inspirational reviews of this juice :-)"

It is zesty, almost eye searing, with sweet orange, key lime and lemongrass up front, yet inviting and calmingly woodsy underneath with notes of oakmoss, cedar, sweet patchouli, wet earth and pine.

Wearing Orange Verte is like walking along the edge of a brook barefoot on a dappled forest floor and finding an orange tree growing there. You pause for some minutes admiring its beauty, then go on your way.

Orange Verte is often criticized for its poor longevity, but it lasts well enough if you spray liberally on clothes and don't expect much sillage. And if you miss the orange after an hour, simply reapply— Orange Verte is so classy and understated, no one will ever guess you are wearing 12 or 15 sprays by the end of the day.

And anyway, who cares. Orange Verte is a fragrance for the wearer. Wear it when you want to feel happy or soothed. Wear it to bed."

From the get-go, it's all about fresh, fruity citrus. Oranges, limes, mango, and some basil combine to create and extremely cooling citrus and projects quite well and lasts a good 4 to 5 hours projection-wise. Kinda reminds me of Froot Loops, actually. Perhaps my only gripe about Concentré is that it can be quite ""perfumey"", but it's so pleasant and refreshing that anything negative gets usurped for the most part. Completely unisex and makes an amazing everyday scent in the summer. It's a bit fruitier, sweeter, and not as stuffy as Eau d'Orange Verte, in my opinion.

I also love the bottle. Frosted dark green glass looks so cool.

FYI, this one is less of a nod to the classic Eau de Colognes than it is more like Eau Sauvage. Really, this is Eau Sauvage, but with more oranges and fruitier, if you want something to compare it to."

Basil really sets this fragrance apart, very dark green, herbal, yet not bracing.

In union with amber and patchouli, Concentre d`Orange Verte offers a wonderful velvety warmth. Even the waxy rind is present in the tempered drydown. Yes, this is a warm orange that dotes on the wearer with its comforting quality and strength.

Fortifying, yet soothing. Attractive and astute in the most natural way."

Both the peel and the fruit are represented here, and they smell quite appealing. This is not, however, a sweet composition; it is clean and fresh--not sticky--on the skin.

The fragrance develops relatively quickly to a greenish-woody drydown, which is equally beautiful. I find the drydown to be aromatic enough to make CONCENTRE D'ORANGE VERTE seem a bit on the masculine side, though many women would still feel comfortable wearing it. This is definitely a perfect summertime scent for anyone who loves fresh, authentic-smelling orange and equally fresh basil combined harmoniously with cedar and patchouli.

I have a purse spray of this pleasing composition, but may have to acquire a larger bottle, as I find it most addicting! The only other fragrance I've found with this nice of an orange presentation is Bond no 9 LITTLE ITALY, but I'm not sure yet which I like most...

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","Once you get interested in niche fragrances you start to want to try the Serge Lutens line because they are so much discussed and because they have been so enormously influential. The minimalist rectangular Lutens bottles and the names are so evocative that they also get you wondering.

I wanted to try one of the most famous Lutens of all, and this was to me an enormous disappointment: even though i can admire how complex the pyramid of notes are (you really do move very clearly from top to heart to base, smelling mostly new things at each stage of the game), this is pretty much everything I don't want in a perfume. It starts with a medley of Middle Eastern spices, which includes the strong labdanum/cistus smell, which has mysteriously been left off the list of fragrance notes above but is the strongest thing in this; it then moves to the amber and resins, mixed with a decided whiff of patchouli, which becomes very pronounced.

Ambers are usually nice by my lights, but the medicinal smell of the herbs and the strong whiff of patchouli made this particular one seem like a very expensive hippie fragrance: it seems like a much fancier version of what I often smell here in Portland on the light rail system. Unfortunately I thus associate these particular smells with someone trying (usually ineffectively) to mask their body odor, so I just could never enjoy this--in fact, I had a hard time thinking who would, given its cost; although I do appreciate how nicely it was put together."

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","Le Lion de Chanel reminded me of something, and now I realized what it was. To me, parts of it is pretty darn similar to Ambre Sultan!

This is a deceivingly simple, but oh so effective fragrance. To quote Lutens: ""The point of departure was a scented wax, found in a souk and long forgotten in a wooden box. The amber only became sultanesque after I reworked the composition using cistus, an herb that sticks to the fingers like tar, then added an overtone that nobody had ever dreamed of: vanilla."" This sentence, while definitely describing the scent accurately, amused me a little. Which perfumer has NOT considered a tone of vanilla added to amber?

With that said, this has a lot of beautiful smoky labdanum that is so much more interesting than most ambers due to the addition of cistus (which is taken from the leaves of the same plant you get labdanum from, the European Rock Rose) which gives it a herbal, spicy, and almost sweaty feel.

To me this is one of the best ambers around, and it strays from being another boring sweet one-dimensional amber with the help of the interesting facets of the cistus. Definitely recommended for a cozy and solemn cloud around you on cold days.

Notes: amber, cistus, vanilla"

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","This to me will always be the paragon of ambers.

In 2008, I wandered into Barney's in Copley Square Boston and discovered the wide world of high-end and niche fragrance (before I believe ""niche"" was even really a descriptor) and was struck by their Serge Lutens counter and its display of understated, elegant and somewhat austere bottles. I was really immediately drawn in by the dense and complex scents, otherworldly and enchanting to me at the time. The saleswoman offered me samples of three: Chergui, Arabie, and Ambre Sultan. I was smitten with all three and went on my way, using these small atomizers sparingly so as to relish them. Shortly thereafter, I flirted with fragrance buying, having purchased a handful of others in the next year or two (a couple of which were somewhat regrettable decisions in retrospect: Bond No. 9 Coney Island, yikes). However, curiously enough, I never bought a full bottle of any Serge Lutens. My collection only grew to about may 10 or so bottles at one point and I then started to direct my attention elsewhere.

Fast forward about seven years later, and the art of perfume making caught my attention after purchasing a few bottles of essential oil to diffuse. I continued pretty consistently but have never taken to another level, due to fear and anxiety of the sheer dedication and amount of money that must be invested to start a fragrance line and a small business in general (I am feeling more and more confident as of late, stay tuned). This has led, however, to much deeper appreciation for fragrance and scent, studying hundreds of natural materials and aromachems, learning from mentors in the fragrance community, collecting and educating myself through fragrance composition books, studying the history of perfume, and then came 2020.

2020, the year of horror, disbelief, anger, tragedy, and sadness in multitudes: I will leave it at that. What would preoccupy me during all this difficult stuff? Somehow, 2020 was also the year that out of nowhere, I decided, why not buy a few full bottles of some fragrances that I love and appreciate (a few he says, a FEW). I caught the full bottle bug, as it were, and I am just now trying to reign it in—and it hasn't even been a full calendar year!

I finally purchased bottles of Chergui, Arabie, and Ambre Sultan, twelve or so years later (and I didn't stop there as far as Serge Lutens is concerned, no doubt). So I sit here, with it sprayed on the interior on my forearm, and I periodically sniff through each stage of its development and big love is still there. That opening is rapturous bliss, warm, sweet and resinous, then in the dry down, the oregano, bay leaf, angelica, and myrtle, these are what sing on my skin in the most wonderfully peculiar manner; ahhhh...this is what got me hooked, this left field of herbal melange with animalic undertones. Then it dries in time to a dry myrrh and somber, dusty labdanum, with an outline of benzoin and vanilla; mythical, even transcendental to my nose.

What I've learned in my full bottle journey this year is sometimes you go back ""home"" to what initiated that spark, what ignites that passion, drives one's desire and is a reminder of what is essential, These are indulgences of what are sensory and sensual, after all. Will I continue to acquire more? Yes, but one most slow down and eventually stop somewhere—it has already surpassed what could be considered practical or even dare I say healthy (I've been a voracious collector at heart since I was single-digit aged). I do think, however, that if I had to stop here, I'd be happy that I finally have a bottle of my Ambre Sultan."

I worked out in it...still smells good, maybe even a bit better because my skin is heated up. Put another dab on after a hot shower and wow does hot skin bring out more of the notes. Right now it is amber, spice, hint of myrrh, and possibly the bay leaf everyone refers to...it isn't an obvious herbal smell, but it's a hint of something different than the rest of the warm notes...gives it a bit of something undefinable, maybe strikes just the right hint of balance to keep the amber and resin from being too sweet.
I have hope that this frag is going to wear me out all day. I'll check back in with longevity. If Arabie was love (it was and is), then Ambre Sultan is unbridled lust.
UPDATE: After about 6 hours it becomes a skin scent, still gorgeous, a lovely afterglow. At 14 hours it is barely discernible, but I can still catch faint whiffs of beautiful warm sweetness if I put my nose to my skin."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","I blind bought Amber Sultan from online store after the hype from YouTube reviewers, and the fact I own Santal Majuscule and I really love it (simple, reach, creamy and rosy sandalwood).

When I received it, it reminded me immediately of Bentley for man intense, but less sweet and without the boozy vibe.

""Main Accords"" bars (on top right of the page) describes it very well, much better than the note voting.

It is way more resinous than ambery, it goes ambery but never make it, it's even aromatic more than ambery, and it can easily be cloying in warmer weather, it lacks some sweetness to match the warmth of the dense resinous smell.

That's being said, I still like it, but it's not what I expected.
If you like sweet, simple amber this might not be your favorite.

I would give it 7/10, and I don't think I'll buy it again."

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","Just an absolutely warm, comforting, exotic scent. It is a staple of my collection and I never want to be without it, especially in the fall and winter. That said, I live in a tropical climate, and it works just fine in the heat and humidity, as long as I go light on the application. The oregano and bay are dominant in the open, but after maybe 30 minutes a spicy incense accord opens up and takes over. After about another 30 minutes, a warm, slightly honeyed amber accord emerges with vanilla undertones. This scent envelops me for about 7 hours. Both projection and sillage are moderate. I would love to get my hands on a vintage bottle to compare performance. That said, I am perfectly happy with the current formulation and think it is a great value at the price."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","I got several samples to get my nose on and one was an Amber fragrance. At first it didn’t really live up to all the hype that I had seen but I wore it a few more times and then I understood all the positive reviews thus falling in love with the note of amber. I then started seeking the best amber fragrance and Serge Lutens Ambre Sultan kept surfacing. It got my attention and I blind bought this. At work I received a notice that it was delivered waiting for me once I got home. For once I was excited and couldn’t wait to get home. Once unpacking I unscrew the top and let me say, in all honesty, it was love at first sniff! POW; one of those WOW fragrances. I’ll admit this is my first amber fragrance but not certain I’ll seek any more with having this. One thing for certain; it will always be a bottle of this within reach from here on out! Instantly one of my top 5 fragrances. Warm, smooth, spicy , slightly sweet, that projects a good 6 feet and performs on my skin 8-10 hrs. I woke up the following morning and could still smell it on my wrist. If you are straddling the fence about this one, I highly recommend you quit putting it off. My sample was TF’s Amber Absolu and to me this is every bit as good for a fraction of the cost and easy to get!"
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","Heavenly amber. Warm, exotic, mysterious and a bit spicy. Just like a good lover. 😉

The amber is a dry and dusty powdery vanilla, which combines with the resins and spices to resemble a hot desert air blowing over a Moroccan market.

I think I love it but the special blend of herbs and spices make it smell too much like food for my liking. Less the mysterious, handsome stranger I wanted to be and more like a casserole/tagine. The performance is slightly poor as well. Big tick for Tom Ford's AA.

Edit: just reworn TF-AA: I miss the herbs. One-all. The bay-leaf in Amber Sultan does give it a little more balance and (in a way) mystery, and as such is slightly more rewarding. Amber Absolute relies solely on the resins."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","I'll agree with what others have said here: this is the Holy Grail of amber fragrances.

It's dense but never stifling, sweet but never cloying (thanks to the oregano and angelica), and has an animalic, furry, purring heart.

I also agree with the general consensus that this is an adult fragrance — elegant and very posh.

I see most people have classified this as a fall/winter scent. It's the middle of July here in the US, 90ºF and fairly humid, and I have to say, this blooms beautifully in the heat albeit with significantly fewer sprays than I'd use in cooler weather.

This is an incredible perfume and I hope I never have to be without it at any point in the future."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","oh wow not what I was expecting. this stuff is extremely manly. not for the feint of heart. this wouldn't be good for anyone under age 35-40. this is a man's man cologne. it reminds me of bentley intense. it's not very ambery to my nose, at least that's my first impression. more like boozy cigar smell with a touch of sweet

second impression- same thing! just smells boozy and tobacco. just like a toned down version of bentley intense. no detectable amber whatsoever. it's a weaker, higher quality version of bentley intense with a touch more balsamic notes. and that's it haha

it smells good. better than bentley intense. but the performance is sub par so I can't recommend it. if it performed and the price was better I'd say get this over bentley intense

third impression- after the dry down this changes into something darker than bentley intense. similar to Armani code absolu although less sweet. but it's in that vein. I do finally pick up a little bit of amber, however it's so hard to tell that it's amber because of how dark and boozy this fragrance is. the performance is still sub par, but not quite as weak as I first thought. projection is minimal but sillage is pretty decent. all in all this is a quality frag like all serge lutens, but it's not groundbreaking in uniqueness as it smells like a lot of other fragrances on the market

overall this is not a sweet crowd pleasing amber fragrance. this is a dark, boozy, balsalmic offering that is for formal wear only. this is polarizing as it's very dark and brisk, just like bentley intense. it is a mix between that and Armani code profumo. so if you own those fragrances you won't need this at all. this is for a man if anyone is wondering. a formal dressed man at say a cocktail lounge or a singles party for well dressed high to do people.

Pure amber and churchy myrrh mixed with vivacious herbs like thyme, rosemary and menthol. This is masculine, sexy, dark and mysterious. This is what you pair with a brown peacoat in the cold days, having people looking back at you whilst you make an impact. I am too young to wear this but it is a a masterpiece from SL. The herbs are so realistic in this you can even taste them, that menthol medicinal note is strong and intertwines with the amber perfectly.

the bad: way too much sweetness. cloying, thick, imbalanced. this is a good example of niche, but engineered to be a western crowd pleaser (EG sugar in every processed thing we eat).

I spent a long weekend at such a camp south of Algiers 24 years ago. If I had been wearing this perfume, it would have made an already exotic adventure even more so. I have to keep sniffing the top of my wrist (my favorite place to sniff frequently) to follow its evolution. At first, it faintly reminded me of those Christmas incense cones we used to burn in my childhood, woodsy and spices. Now it’s soft, gentler, but still basically the same. It doesn’t shout, so I can see wearing it anywhere and not overpowering a room. This version is the EDP I got in a 3 ml decant, obviously not enough now. Someone said “honey”. Yes, I perceive a bit, but not very sweet. It’s mostly spicy and calls for a fireplace to be lit and a hot toddy maybe?"

Anyway, it's the brown liquid bottle, very nice fragrance. When first applied, I get an overwhelming Amber, vanilla, honeyed coriander scent. Maybe some bay leaf and myrrh. Definitely has the resins going on mixed with the benzion.

It's soft, beautiful, meant to be enjoyed more at night by a fire with a special someone. It's a very special scent for close love encounters.

Starts out powerful and morphs into a much warmer fragrance at the 3rd hour. It's got good longevity, I'd say 7 hours at least. Projection is moderate overall. I don't know if what I have is vintage, but I'd say it's two to three years old. In any case, I wear very seldomly and it's best fitted for cooler climates.

I loved the opening blast but felt it became a bit too tame, too quickly. After another day of wearing it though, I have changed my mind. This is just such an incredibly charming fragrance,just so damn pleasant to wear. It really envelopes the wearer in a cloak of warmth. I wish the herbal notes hung around a little bit longer, and it doesn't seem to have great sillage (though longevity is decent), but I find myself sniffing my wrists constantly while wearing it, it is so comforting, soothing, calming. The overall effect is akin to getting an aromatherapy massage with a base of beeswax and coconut oil on a private island. This smells like money and sunshine, I feel like a king, a very chilled out king, when wearing this. Santal Majuscule remains my favourite Lutens so far (and I've only tried a few), but this comes a close second. I bought 100ml on a blind buy, absolutely no regrets. Anyone who likes this would probably also like Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille, that one has a similar warmth, but on my skin at least, retains its herbal qualities a bit longer.

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","It begins with a tango between kitchen herbs (a black-pepepry spicy bay leafs mostly) and perhaps dry labdanum.

Then (maybe) the labdanum turns to its balsamic sour side, even with a barely recognizable rhubarb hint: my guess is, this is due to the muffled plastic incense at the bottom.

Next, the big chunk of body note —— (maybe) myrrh —— steps up. It smells like a mellow, tuber-y traditional Chinese herb (板蓝根), with a dash of bitter juice. I also sensed the muffled plastic incense hint.

Before you know it, a...what can I say...clotted creamy waxy note, with the faintest petroleum hint, crept beneath the myrrh. Is that Benzoin, or just another facet of myrrh?

At the far end of dry down, after it turns into a skin scent, the bitter juice aspect of Myrrh(?) becomes more prominent, still mixed with a few kitchen herbs, along with a date pit-like labdanum.

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","This was a surprise. Didn't smell anything like I imagined.

I just sprayed this on about thirty minutes ago. It goes on dry, and scratchy. Almost like splintering wood. But when it mellows down, on my skin, the resins and amber have been producing a honey-like sweetness. It's VERY sweet.

The bay leaf and coriander however, give it a really strong, peppery note that strangely compliments the smooth sweetness of the resins well, and gives it a dry smoke quality, while also being oily.

I initially thought I'd made a mistake with this, because bay leaf and coriander usually ruin perfumes for me. However, it's growing on me. I'll update at the end of the day to see how I feel about it overall.

UPDATE:

This rapidly grew on me. I really did not like it to begin with. I didn't like the intense sweetness of the resins paired with the herbal scent of the sage and coriander. However, the combination grew on me and I found myself wearing my sample to death because I liked it so much.

This does not have much projection. Maybe twelve inches off the skin, at most. So anyone very near you will smell it, but it won't fill a room by any means. I would say this has excellent lasting power, lasting eight hours on my skin. This is no small task, as my skin burns through perfumes like no other.

However, would I recommend this as a safe buy? Not in the slightest. Don't buy this on a whim. This will absolutely not please everyone. Were it solely a resin fragrance, it might be more crowd-pleasing, but the addition of sage is not a note everyone will enjoy. If you do decide to give it a chance, I'd recommend extended testing, because if it repulsed you as much as it did me at first, you may just need to sit with it for a while before you make your final decision."

Dried fruits that come wrapped in a blanket of spicy yet creamy and warm, almost slightly burnt amber with sprinklings of oregano, coriander and bay leaf.

This is not as much a sweet amber as it is a dirty one - a great fusion of notes with the incensy amber playing the main theme. Very well composed, even if the notes are somewhat stereotypical, the art here is making them work together very seamlessly which Sheldrake manages to A+. After the first half hour it's pretty linear and not evolving that much, but it is long lasting, dry, rich and deep with some reminiscence of an arabian souq. I even find some tiny similarities to Tauer's LADDM, as it is only slightly - as in very little - sweeter. Also, what makes it stand out from other ambers, is the herbal aspect which keeps it from smelling too sweet and at the same time makes it continually interesting to return to.

If you're an amber lover you should definitely check this out, personally I find this one of the top 3 ambers I've ever tried."

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","The first few minutes, I get mint&rosemary. When the initial alcohol blast has evaporated, the bay leaf unveils its real face, dancing with a strong myrrh, and supported by vanilla and patchouli in the background. That's it for now, and so will it be for the rest of the show, as this perfume is very linear.

Amber has no smell in itself. What people usually call ""amber"" is simply vanilla, supported by resins (labdanum and/or myrrh and/or opoponax) and possibly sandalwood.
While I think this fragrance is well blended, and definitely has the Lutens signature, its name is misleading. This should have been named Bay Leaf Sultan.

The bay leaf may be hard to pull out for a man, and I would tend to see this one as more leaning towards feminine for that reason. Just my opinion.
A pass for me, but still a great and unique sweet bay leaf/myrrh fragrance, if that's what you're looking for.

Edit: I tried it again on skin several times after my review. I am still not sure what is the hype on this one. It's a good amber fragrance, but quite linear: starts bay leaf/myrrh/vanilla, and the only evolution is a change in roles, as it ends vanilla/myrrh/bay leaf. The myrrh is intoxicating, but I still don't fully enjoy the bay leaf (that said, it's an original combo) and the vanillic drydown is generic compared to other ambers.
It's good, and I understand some like it, but I really don't understand why this one is often cited in the top 3 of the best Lutens fragrances... maybe because it's simple and the vanilla makes it easy to wear....?

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","A stone classic: the very definition of what upscale dry amber should be. Strong and resinous but still sweet, welcoming and comfortable, with a spice blend of unique elegance and distinction. Absolutely unisex, but its avatars in my mind are Cary Grant, James Mason, George Clooney - old-world elegance, effortless charm and warmth that radiates from within. This one really opened my eyes to what an amber scent could be - not just vanilla sugariness and a generic vague cuddle, but a much more adult and sophisticated milieu which demands more of you. It's a strong - maybe breathtaking - embrace and a reassuring pat of encouragement on the back. Makes you want to be a better man (even if you're a lady - and I do encourage women to try this one out.) You could settle into this one like a robust, well-upholstered sofa and live there happily for ever after. Projection is in the just-right mid range and longevity's solid - 7h and beyond on my skin. Just stellar.

Having said that: I can't deal with the bayleaf over time (it gives me a headache...) so I must have a little solo weep about that and go with some other dry ambers that don't have Sultan's herbal edge. It is so nearly a lifetime love and I can absolutely recognise and back up its reputation as a champion in the field. But oh, that bullying bay ... begone, vexatious leaf! Otherwise pretty much perfect. For me, Ambre Sultan will be forever the Oh So Nearly scent, the one that got away."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","I had a bottle many years ago with the Palais Royal label. It was a knockout. Yes there was sweet amber but it was intertwined with the most sophisticated mix of “herbal tobacco” (that’s what it smelled like to me) and gave off a sillage that smelled like old money. It was pure magic to top off your fall/winter wardrobe with a scent like that, people seemed to want to get closer and investigate. I got alot of compliments wearing it and one time a potential client asked in the middle of our meeting “what is that heavenly scent that you are wearing?” and not only did I book the job but years later she informed me that she bought a bottle for her husband and it is now his favorite. I like the memory of this because these people were nouveau riche and really needed some Lutens in their lives to complete the look of the roles they were trying to play. I don’t think she’d even ever heard of Serge Lutens. Anyways, when that bottle ran out I bought a new one from a discount fragrance site (new label, not the latest black one but the intermediate) and it was unmistakably duller, sweeter, and weaker in sillage. It was Ambre Sultan (same notes) but like a xerox copy with the machine running out of ink. I held onto it and planned to buy one direct from SL the next time I go to Paris to replace it. But when I went to Paris, I sampled Ambre Sultan in the shop and it was exactly like the new bottle I owned at home. Now I read reviews that confirm what I have experienced and it seems the original formula has been tweaked atleast enough to notice. It’s still wonderful and after selling my second bottle on ebay, I think that I will try and save up for a vintage bottle. Great stuff that really IMO deserves the hype. Amber is already a crowd pleaser but Serge Lutens and Christopher Sheldrake really are genius here when they contrasted its’ cozy sweet warmth with dry, herbal, piquant, smokey goodness. EDIT: I finally purchased a vintage bottle and I realize now that the difference between the old and new formulas isn’t as dramatic as I may have thought when I wrote the above. It comes down to the herbal notes being softer in the new formula and the sweetness more pronounced, less complex. It’s still a great perfume."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","So I was at a job interview at Barney's Department Store --Restaurant, Fred's, and just decided to at least give a visit to the perfume department and lucked up on a sample of Ambre Sultan.

I'm not a passionate fan of Serge Luten, for no reason at all. I love Tubereuse Criminelle a lot but I think the prices of this line just deter me. Reading the notes, I didn't think Ambre Sultan would really appeal to me or be as heavily aromatic.However, It does give off an expensive smoke smell, in a Shalimar like way --which I love. ( Go, Myrrh) I can't say I'm crazy about this, but it worth my attention and more appealing than Vanille Bois.

The sales associate were nice and generous as if she knew I wasn't going to get the job and that made the trip worth it, and now I want to return and get a full bottle of Ambre Sultan as that it price is not too threatening at 150.00. Though I'm not passionate about the line, I can not take away the strength/heaviness that are these fragrance --which holds my attention. I complain about the price but with the strength and heavy aroma of Serge Lutens --it worth it... and Ambre Sultan certainly is. ( oh, that Fille en Aiguilles-marvelous )"
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","The latest version just reminds me of cream soda, which isn't a bad thing. I could wear this on occasion."

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","I love amber dominant scents. Favorites include Hermes’ Elixir des Merveilles, Ambre Fétiche from Annick Goutal, MFK’s Grand Soir and Ambre Extreme from L`Artisan Perfumer. Today I can add Ambre Sultan to that list.

It should come as no surprise that I’m also a Serge Luten fan, even when I find his creations difficult to wear I still respect the compositions. But that’s not Ambre Sultan. This dark beauty is easy to wear: smoky resins combined with spices take this scent in an erotic direction. Bay leaf makes an entrance after the initial 10 minute opening.

If there’s anything critical to point out it’s that this perfume is quite linear. That’s not an issue for me because I love it as is. Performance is very good, projection is moderate with just one spray.

If you love amber, this is a must try. Another piece of perfume art from the house of Serge Luten."

Because I waited almost eight hours to escape this aromatic print of the bay leaf and it does not happen ... even the last trace of the perfume on the skin is dominated by this facet. I am extremely sorry because I wanted to find here a warm, extravagant and exceptional amber.

I jumped over A.P Ambre Orient tester in dutyfree where I tested almost the whole line, but looking at the pyramid I think it's missing out what Ambre Sultan has in a great amount ... this aromatic character. So, it goes on the asap test list and it's not going to be missed next time!"

Revisiting a fragrance is always an interesting experience and was curious about this one...it's been 7-8 years since I first sniffed this, at the beginning of my fragrance journey; to put it nicely. Fragrance haze and obsession is probably more appropriate as to what was happening but I know that I am in safe hands here now, so I'm comfortable with my confession.
So..back to the fragrance. It is less sweet than I remembered and also more woody. Still liking it, that has not changed, so I guess Ambre Sultan is one of my timeless likes. Interestingly I seem to get 8 hrs out of this, not a massive silalge but wafts here and there..
Memories are fickle but it's true. Feelings awakened by a fragrance do stick around longer... It is a warm embrace still, Ambre Sultan."

I like my orientals dry, and this was sticky sweet. I think the amber was just a little too strong, and I like mine to be more in the background. Some of my favorite scents have amber, but not as the leading note. This and Arabie were the only two scents from Serge Lutens I've disliked, and I can't help but wonder if it's because I'm not accustomed to the resinous spice market qualities of a true oriental yet."

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","I'm delighted to finally try out Serge Lutens Ambre Sultan since it has among the best reputations of the line, most notably as it compares to other amber fragrances in general, and Tom Ford Amber Absolute in particular, and I agree that the comparison is warranted.

It's an amber-dominant fragrance, as the name suggests, with heavy doses of incense and vanilla, and it's in this trinity that it's very similar to the 2015 rendition of Tom Ford Amber Absolute. Ambre Sultan also features the spicy, provocative bay leaf, some woods, and a handful of other minor players (florals, herbs per some note lists) that don't hold a candle to the benzoin-leaning amber dominance.

Given its composition, Ambre Sultan's performance is unsurprisingly very good. It boasts projection that's above average and longevity that's quite strong. At a discounted price (on FragranceNet) of $52 for 50ml, it's surely a bargain.

It smells of incense and old European churches. Wild days spent under oak trees in the California coastal forests. Riding horseback through the desert. My herb garden in late summer when the fog rolls in but the season's heat still lingers.

The point of departure was a scented wax, found in a souk and long forgotten in a wooden box. The amber only became sultanesque after I reworked the composition using cistus, an herb that sticks to the fingers like tar, then added an overtone that nobody had ever dreamed of: vanilla. Why? Because vanilla is sticky, too, and it clung to my memory. ""

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


There are ambers, and then there is Ambre Sultan.

Ambre Sultan is a big amber perfume with a focus on herbal elements. The point of departure is an overdose of medicinal bay leaf; an uncanny but tremendously successful pairing. There is a touch of oregano; together the herbal parts perfectly complement and cut through the sweetness of amber, resins and vanilla. The herbs are more prominent initially, but prevail till the finish when the vanilla is more prominent. The sweetness is not sticky or cloying, but thick and dry, like a shawl.

Ambre Sultan is immensely enveloping, and retains one's interest unlike ninety five percent of all 'amber' perfumes. One can wear this day in, day out. One can wear this anywhere, from the Sahara to the Poles.

Exceptional.

Although, magic happens in the first few minutes. This becomes a totally different perfume. So creamy and smooth, resinous and incredibly well blended into a sweet amber. Spicy and oriental largely due to the coriander and myrrh. Just lovely. I totally imagine this as late afternoon scent for the hotter days to sit by the pool drinking a refreshing cocktail. Nevertheless, don't be fooled, this is a super warm perfume: it really shines on colder days."

I love this resinous and ambery scent! Especially after it has been on my skin for an hour, it becomes magical. The first hour is just as wonderful but when it totally dries down it maintains that resinous sweetness but i can also smell vanilla, myrrh (which I am learning is a note I like) and sandalwood. I imagine that this is what a high end spa would smell like in India."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","(review from a sample)
Ambre Sultan is a gorgeous oriental fragrance. Initially what I smell most are amber and resins, vanilla and bay leaf, plus a bit of spiciness; after a while, on me it is mostly about resins and vanilla - now, my nose is still training, so I can't really distinguish between the various types of resins and spices, but yeah, this is what I and my mom smelled.
It is well rounded, creamy and smooth, without rough edges, and it is pretty long lasting, with moderate sillage.

Surely, the best amber I've smelled so far. It reminds me of the Middle East, unsurprisingly, or better the idea of it since I've never been there!
It is just a tiiiiny bit powdery, that is, I wouldn't wear it in the summer nor warm spring, but it is great for colder seasons."

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","I wasn't amazed unfortunately.
Composition is great, it's a quality juice, well blended.

But in my opinion it's really more on a feminime side rather being 50/50 unisex. I dont feel masculine vibe in it. It doesn't say - I am a man. Or - I can be a man.
Sahara Noir has a strong masculine vibe, this one doesn't.

I would recommend everyone to try it, definitely. Buy a decant and let yourself know for educational purposes what this famous fragrance is.
But if you're a man - think twice before getting a full bottle without testing it first.

And in my opinion it's not even closely similar with TF's- Amber Absolute despite some people compare them.

In my mind, Ambre Sultan was stronger in the early 2000... Not bad but doesn't Worth its price and reputation anymore...
I wrote this after applying about 20 sprays on my neck & shirt within 3 hours... Opinion confirmed by the 5 colleagues I'm working with today who barely noticed it when they made more comments yesterday about Ambré lumière that filled our space...
And now (14/02/2018) for €120/50ml or €190/75ml, this is ridiculously greedy. Sorry. SL, not anymore.

Lutens reste une référence absolue dans l'univers de la parfumerie de niche, mais je trouve qu'AS a perdu de sa superbe ou faut-il dire de sa radicalité.
Je l'avais porté au début des années 2000, puis mon goût m'avait entraîné vers Bornéo 1834 et Cuir Mauresque.
Cet automne, tout comme l'été, est très ""ambré"" pour moi. J'achète, je teste, je réexplore...
Ambre Sultan est le chef de file du groupe au sein duquel je trouve à Ambré Lumière plus de charme. Il s'ouvre aussi sur un registre pharmaceutique/aromatique, mais s'étire dans une vanille confortable et charnelle. Ce qui me convient mieux. Et le sillage est bien plus fort.

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","I got this as a blind buy and when I first sprayed it on, my heart sank. Instead of this warm rich, spicy amber I got this disgusting sour piss + booze opening that made it impossible to wear. I couldn't understand the hype around this. Although the dry down a few hours later provided a creamier, more pleasant amber-vanilla, I was quite aghast.

Now it's been a few days and my reaction to that opening hasn't changed, but I will say this: the overall effect is quite charming, but this is not something you can bury your nose in, at least for the first few hours. From about a foot away you get this very warm, delicious boozy vanilla and resinous amber that is dense and foreboding, but enticing. Up close it's sour, pissy, medicinal, pungent.

""Spicy"" is a bit misleading as it isn't particularly hot or peppery--its ""spiciness"" is more in the ""spices"" bay leaf and coriander, which, strike me as more aromatic rather than anything spicy or warming.

The more I spend time with this, the more I like it, but I have to say it's not for me. Vanilla is not my favorite note in perfume, and contrary to what it says above, I unfortunately, get a lot of it."

How should I have it? I'm not sure yet. I've gone from ""meh, not my cup of tea"" to ""woow, I LOVE it and I have to order a bottle now, even though I might need to take from my savings account!"" to ""yikes, what IS this weird rubber-ish smell?"".
And I'm kind of still there, I like it at certain moments but I can't get rid of the feeling that it is something unpleasant in the beginning, smelling a bit like... burnt pork? Or burnt skin? I guess I will just make sure my small sample vial gets empty and then I will make up my mind properly. After all, the warm comforting amber and myrrh in Ambre Sultan is really golden and delicious.

Good longevity but one couldn't expect less of a Serge Lutens. I know this is probably one of the most beloved ambers out there and hopefully, I will appreciate it more one day. Just when the burnt-skin note disappears (it might just be a question of skin chemistry). I'm a fan of Lutens otherwise!"
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']",This one starts off smelling kind of like a medicinal shaving cream which gives it a very masculine opening that I'm not too fond of but that doesn't last long. After about 10 minutes it changes to a nice Amber Sandalwood on my skin which lasts maybe about an hour and then it dries down to a vanilla resin Amber which is sweet and comfy unless at least another five or six hours on my skin. I'm not a fan of the opening on my skin but I love the dry down
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","This may be the best Amber fragrance out there, surely the #1 Lutens fragrance for me.
TF Amber Absolu is great as a dominant amber fragrance. Amber Sultan has a more interesting and pleasing contrasting notes.
You have a great rich and smooth Labdanum amber with a bit of chocolaty Patchouli. Then you have the bracing Green Bay leaf and Angelica, then ad a little spice of oregano and coriander.
It all is so well blended, very nice fragrance just for chilling on a cool Autumn evening.
I put it in my top 5 for Fall and Winter.

Many miss the Myrtle flower here. It's subtle, but adds a beautiful soft herbal floral touch. Making this very enjoyable for woman, along with the soft spices. Very gender neutral.

The beginning is horrible. Later it is a bit better but still nothing I would like to wear or smell. It is definitely something different but unfortunately for me not in the right way. I was really curious to try this but I am quite disappointed.

A pleasing sweet amber, but on me it's too weak, with only a few inches of projection. It's a good cuddle-scent, but not what I'm looking for in terms of all-day powerful enjoyment."

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","Gorgeous fragrance! Wonderful quality!

Amber is something I am more inclined to wear during autumn or winter. Still, I do agree it does bloom in the summer.

I think this fragrance does deserve all the accolades it receives here. However, I can't help but to compare it to what is in my view, the Queen of ambers: Ladies' Must de Cartier.

Ambre Sultan is a more straight forward amber, and I find it warmer than Must de Cartier. But to me, Must de Cartier's amber accompanied by its floral accords, green notes and its masterful complexity, make it a composition ""sine qua non.""

Sorry Ambre Sultan, I really like you, and I'm afraid you may possibly be of better quality than Must de Cartier's current formulation, but you get second place in my heart."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","I find many amber scents to be either too starkly linear or inoffensively bland. Fortunately, Ambre Sultan is neither -
rather, it is a masterfully balanced amber scent with enough bite to declare its presence, but also enough warmth to be truly comforting.

Ambre Sultan's composition is simple yet rich. Smooth amber, resin and benzoin notes are lifted by just the right dose of herbal, aromatic bay leaf. It is rounded out by sweet, creamy vanilla and sandalwood. Arm's length projection and good longevity make it eminently wearable. Although sweet, soft and somewhat powdery, Ambre Sultan is definitely unisex. I'm not usually one for orientals or heavier scents, but this is definitely full bottle worthy. Wonderful stuff."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","So wild and elemental. An unchained force of nature. The strong herbal, somewhat medicinal, camphorous, propolis-like opening reminds me to the calamus root (Calami rhizoma) which I sometimes made a horrible tasting tea of, and which smelled like ripe feet. Yet it already shows some dark sweetness, and the amber is just like the smell form the small vial of Indian amber fragrant oil that I bought at an Oriental shop and cherish ever since, it is very close to that at the base phase. I cannot get enough of that wonderful incensy amber scent, it is so much alive, purring, murmuring and humming from my skin, like a furry animal, both soft and lethal but so charming. Smelling this makes me feel one with the elemental forces of nature, like a thunder or a hurricane, or a tiger... so deep, powerful and irresistible, not really in the romantic sense of the word. For me it is highly attractive, but I think for most people it carries an intimidating kind of power. It is definitely beyond words, beyond talking and chasing petty wordly ambitions, it is so much above the power play. I imagine the Red Sea would part again if someone wearing Ambre Sultan would approach it, it carries such an unquestionable force. On the other hand, it is very complex. The dark colour really reflects the nature of this scent, and its texture is thick and oily, leaving a mark on your skin where you applied it."

I tested this fragrance and was at first turned off by the camphorous, almost cough syrupy opening. After lletting it settle though, I became obsessed with the world it created. It's Istanbul in a painting- Topkapi Palace in a bottle. This is a strong, dark, bittersweet perfume and most people would probably designate it for their winter perfume wardrobe. I think this is a smell that goes well with warm weather too- because resins, woods and spices only react so fragrantly in warm weather. What a beautiful, opulent gem of a perfume! Ambre Sultan has swiftly worked its way into the ""must always have"" section of my collection."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","Ambre Sultan is perfectly unisex to me. This amber is spicy, a tad medicinal. At first it reminds me quite a bit of Estee Lauder's Amber Mystique, but whereas that one develops to be dark, smoky, and sweet, Ambre Sultan becomes brighter and not especially sweet, less dense somehow. Actually, it becomes almost savory with the bay and oregano definitely detectable, and while it isn't light, it isn't actually heavy either. It has a bit of a ""quintessential"" oriental feel to it, and it strikes me as rustic, and so, understated. Chergui strikes me the same way, and that's one thing I love about this house. Their scents are rich and interesting without being over-the-top or stupidly ""complex."" I am curious to see how Sultan will play out in warmer weather."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","In retrospect Ambre Sultan and LDDM was meant to initiate me into the world of niche fragrances.

I remember that I tested Ambre Sultan in a hot summer day and the experience was initially a shocking one, I felt that my arm will catch fire and I can do nothing to stop it. After that, the dried resins become addictive. Of course, I retested it when the weather became cold and only then I realized the likeness with Mitzah that speak many reviewers, as in cold weather Ambre Sultan become a spiced liqueur.

I think Ambre Sultan was intended to be worn throughout the year, showing its different facets depending on the weather.

Without a doubt, it is one of the best ambers that can be bought and it's sold as a woman perfume, but that makes me smile while I think about other perfumes sold as for men or unisex.

Ambre Sultan, like most Serge Lutens perfumes, is not the most versatile fragrance in the world, in office space should be worn with caution.

I would like to say something about it's price - one of the lowest in the world of niche perfumes, especially regarding at the quality of the ingredients - that shows us once again that enlarging continuously prices of niche perfumes due the cost of ingredients it is a false justification.

It's a 'nice' amber, but too herby, spicy and savoury for me. I may or may not like it on a man, but it felt too masculine for me to wear out and enjoy. Nothing special when it dried down. I much prefer Laura Mercier's Ambre Passion over this. I sold mine on eBay."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","Serge Lutens knows how to do perfume. These aren’t just scents, aromas that dress you up, but composed pieces of artwork. This smells like a desert market 1000 years ago. There's classic incense here, classic oils. Amber is the obvious stand out, but not a plasticy or syrupying amber, a wet oily one rubbed into skin. Myrrh, sandalwood, coriander and vanilla all make themselves known laced throughout the burning heat of the amber. I swear to god there is even oregano. Wearing it, I feel myself in a church somewhere old and hot, and there is light fighting through beams of wood that smell as though they have been freshly cut down and there are candles burning somewhere and the smell of books that have been sitting in someone's kitchen… It’s transformative. Is this a perfume? Or is this a story? I’m lost. It’s complex but it’s kind enough to take you by the hand and walk you piece by piece through this maze. 8.5/10"

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","I always had issues with Serge Lutens fragrances. I love the quality of the compositions, his vision. But I could always hardly imagine myself wearing one of them because they were too feminine or too strong. I had a bad experience with Fumerie Turque which I quickly swapped. That was way too over-the-top for me. So there remained Ambre Sultan which I sampled on so many occasions over the years. I eventually had the opportunity to buy it for a good price. I haven't managed to actually quite enjoy it. It's the kind of perfume I could spray on a handkerchief and leave it around, but on my skin...I'm not sure. As somebody here once pointed, it might be good with a warmer weather. So I'll definitely give it another try this summer."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","Opens with spices, dries down to a vanillic amber with a waxy texture. I wouldn't call it smoky, although a very light incense makes a quick appearance at some point. Quite nice, but it has a metallic tang that bothers me a bit; it's particularly strong 10-30 minutes after the application. It might be the oregano and/or bay leaf?

The performance is average at best. It becomes pretty much a skin scent after an hour and the effective wear time is 4-5 hours max. Certainly not a powerhouse in my books. Lately I spent hours sitting in a car with my mother, who is quite sensitive to perfumes and therefore very vocal with her complaints, and she didn't say a word about this one...

All in all, it's okay and totally wearable, but nothing hype-worthy to me. Likeable, but somewhat uninspiring. To be honest, you'll get a similar spicy-vanillic amber effect with Calvin Klein's Obsession and you actually pay a lot less for better performance. As far as niche ambers go, I'd much rather pick PdE Ambre Russe or Ambra Nera by Farmacia SS. Annunziata."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","I am in shock that I never posted a review for Ambre Sultan...
I love ambers. And this is probably the gold standard in ambers.
It is unusually cool in S Florida and this is the perfect time to pull out your ambers. There is something opulent, magnificent, decadent about the aura that an amber surrounds you. Lutens created the ultimate herbal amber if that makes any sense. Ambers can be very sweet, but the presence of bay leaf cuts through like a knife. And it brings it to another dimension. There are other notes in here as well, but... the beauty of this is that it conjures images of you being surrounded by the most luxurious veil, scarf, coat, whatever you want it to be. It intoxicates your senses the way a glass of good wine will do after a long day at work. It is cozy, but with twisted thoughts in mind. And that to me, is the magic of scents.
Smell great my friends."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","A dense, sensual, spellbinding amber. This smells like Bagdad, Damascus, or Riyadh of the imagination... like a Moroccan souq. The opaque, heavy, incense laden amber is especially prominent in the opening, before it starts giving way to the sharp aromatics which, combined with the flute-like myrrh, add a fascinating edge underneath all the soft, sweet, powdery stuff. Unlike some other Ambers I've smelled, like L'Artisan's Ambre Extreme, this is a somewhat ""dirty"" amber, but not as in the funk of sex (like, say, Muscs Koublai Khan) but that of a room that's had hundreds of years of perfume and incense accumulating in carpets, curtains, furniture, the very walls. Unlike other SL's, it's not challenging or weird, just a potent, perfect amber; as one reviewer called it, a reference amber. I can see why this is so highly regarded - it's a true classic.

Edit: Having a bad day. What is the first thing I reach for? My sample of Ambre Sultan. Being enveloped in a comforting, cashmere cloud of amber makes everything better. :)"

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","Update, I gave a rather superficial review as I do not have words. Ambre Sultan is the smell of hymn books, the warmth of light, the woody smell of church pews, the heat of desert, the gold of a solid piece of amber held in the hand while enjoying the golden light from the exquisite stone.
Agreed with one reviewer: there is something of Organza Indecence in here. To me it is more golden smell than O I and it is deeper, even more opulent if that is possible?
Organza Indecence is pink with a hint of rose gold, Amber Sultan is pure deep amber light and firy warmth.

Will look forward to experience it in the fall. A must for oriental fragrance connoisseurs. It makes me think of amber fetiche by Goutal, yet in this composition the amber becomes warmer perhaps through the use of vanilla and resins."

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","This is based on a decant I received recently, I don't own a bottle of it.

I am comparing this to amber oil that I have, the typical arabic one and I can smell few differences. First of all this one changes with time unlike the amber oil. Second, this is less sweet, less fruity, more smoky than any amber oil I had or tried before.I am not getting any patchouli at all.

I will comment on longevity and sillage after I give it a proper wearing.

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","Ambre Sultan can be the type of fragrance that really challenges a new or unaccustomed nose. I remember when I was new to this hobby and I tried Ambre Sultan-- I really didn't care for it. Most of it was due to the opening, originally.

Now I try it again, and I am in love with this fragrance. It is a very warm, rich and full-bodied amber. I do not find this similar to Amber Absolute personally, as AA has more of a syrup-centric amber at the drydown, whereas AS is more-so focused on a lush vanillic amber. To most though, that distinction won't be as prevalent.

Both AA and AS have challenging openings (AS is foody, AA is smoky), and I do find it for me personally that you need to give them time to wear to open up and reveal its true identity, which is some of the best golden, sweet warmth you can find."

Ambre Sultan by Serge Lutens is Scheherazade pursuing a graduate degree in women's studies, who goes to the shooting range on weekends (with Agent Provocateur lingerie on underneath her clothes!) This fragrance is definitely unisex but retains all of what makes Shalimar sexy: the burning embers and rich resinous vanilla. The top note of sandalwood is what makes it decidedly more masculine, and less hazily seductive. The oregano is a thing of beauty in my mind - a stunning and original addition and I love it. The benzoin practically burns the back of my palate but I adore it, like a fistful of cinnamon-cassia candies. I always ponder for a moment about possibly sharing a spritz or two with my date, but then I decide I'm too selfish and want this all for myself."

Well fast forward to August 2016 and the fragrance seems to have been made PC safe. Gone is the challenging opening and the bold projection. What you have is a scent that smells watered down with the herbal spices virtually gone and a scent that now whispers on the skin when it used to be a roar. What a shame."

The bay leaf / oregano opening is intense and on me, not necessarily a bracing or cool green, but rather reminiscent of dried but pungent spices. Unlike others, I do get hints of amber very soon after application--mostly a subtle vanilla note. After the herbs back down a bit, the amber emerges and remains for many hours. About an hour or two in, a gorgeous beeswax note also enters the scene, adding an impression of heat to the bouquet. Overall the impression I get is one of dry heat, which I think this makes this scent appropriate for both warmer or cooler weather, depending on whether you're trying to cool yourself down in summer or really embrace the vibes."

It smells wonderful. I find myself reaching for it often after work, when I feel the need for a something that smells strong and pleasant. My husband is crazy about this on me.

So just a few thoughts. This was one of the first frags I got when I got into niche and 60-70 frags and a few years later, this is still one of the best darn things I have ever smelled!! These days every niche house has their own Amber frag and quite a few designer houses as well and some of them are very well done. But and this is purely a personal opinion, none of them move me like this one does. Certain things in life touch you on the spirit level, a song, a piece of poetry, a painting, very subjective but when they strike a chord in you, it's like it was made for you. Ambre Sultan does that for me."

It's a fairly safe fragrance, well suited for men and women.

If you like this, try Interlude Man from Amouage, which adds more dimension to the oregano and amber accord by adding smoke, incense and myrrh to the mix, creating a true masterpiece. I score AS an 8/10."

I can't put my finger in what is it that I don't like but I've never felt so strongly (in a negative way) towards a fragrance. I'm glad other people enjoy it so much and again, if anyone is interested in a swap of a bottle with 95% still in.. I'm into greens, woody, fougeres, gourmands, acuatic.. Love perfumes and love trying new fragrances, it just did not go well this time."

Shame really as the drydown is quite nice.

I decided instead to take L'Artisan Perfumeur Ambre Extreme as my Amber scent of choice. This works far better for me as the opening is not harsh like Ambre Sultan."

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","Mr Lutens and I have a kind of love/ hate relationship! Iris silver mist I adore, De Profundis I hated, Chergui, I liked but found it a little bit too sweet. I love Amber and overlooked this one for some time expecting it to be fruity and sweet, how wrong I was! This is the most beautiful Amber fragrance, up there in my top 5 Amber scents, I literally can not stop spraying this stuff! It's not sweet at all, it's resinous Amber and I love it.
EDIT: after trying this I revisited Chergui and I had previously over sprayed obviously as with a gentler hand I loved this and.....ordered a bottle!"
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","Holy Sh**, I wasn't expecting to like this after the fail that was Tom Ford's Sahara Noir but I tried it anyway after reading on Fragrantica that this is a better version of it. It starts off as an oriental herb garden: spice, Amber and a nauseating projection that would initially throw a lot of people off. After an hour or so the vanilla kicks in and it becomes a sensual and rhythmic gospel choir that serenades you as myrrh and sandalwood join the chorus. Absolutely fabulous scent. Projection is amazing, can be smelled across a room, it has fantastic longevity on my stubborn skin (6+ hours). Overall: 8/10 as I find it slightly headache inducing. It is also somewhat similar to Diptyque's Eau Duelle!"
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']",I agree with SNicole82. People see the word Sultan and affiliate this as a spicy amber but it's really not. It's a basic amber in the same mind frame of Ambre 114. It has the same powdery vibe and not a whole lot more to offer. Does it smell good? Of course! Is it a Top 5 amber? IMO no. I am not bashing it in anyway as amber is my favorite note as well but sample some more before buying.
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","This is my perfect amber. I enjoy amber as a base note, but when it's used as the main ingredient, I find it can either become too medicinal or too syrupy and cloying. Ambre Sultan avoids all of those pitfalls and gives us instead a warming, subtle and dry amber.

The woods here stop that syrupy thing happening to the amber. They keep it dry and reined in. The notes list makes it appear as though there's a million different herbs, spices and resins going on - and I'm sure there are - but the end result is some beautiful blending that makes this seem much more simple than it must have been to compose. It smells like amber, woods and subtle spices. Beautifully done.

I have no idea why this is marketed towards women because it's completely unisex. Men, don't be shy about trying this one!

Beautiful."

I'm an amber fanatic. Sweet ambers, dry ambers, resinous ambers, dark ambers, etc. I do it all. I prefer my ambers resinous and dry with a spice kick as it gives me a more earthy vibe, which fits my personality and style.

This was halfway there. It's dry: OK. It's resinous: OK. But, no spice came out. It wasn't really warm. It's a good fragrance don't get me wrong, but after 2 weeks of testing in many settings, I'll stick my Amber Paste.

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","I have written about it previously. Two years later I return with a slightly more accurate design.

If there's one thing that makes me happy after facing a lot of problems that permeated my daily life, it is to write about fragrances, as a whole. Something transcendent happens inside me and I feel myself better through writing. I confess not be too cool to write this, and so I chose a fragrance which gives me besides joy, complete happiness when I use or feel, the elected is the Serge Lutens House, which from the beginning of the 90s presents the consumer market perfumístico with ""arts"" bottled known as niche perfumes, the fragrance in question is the eastern Ambre Sultan launched originally by the hands (nose) Christopher Sheldrake creator of much of the fragrances of the house and also some renowned fragrances Maison Chanel, like Coco Noir Extrait. Now, to me, Ambre Sultan opens dirty and high power. Logo appears sound huge doses of coriander, dried leaves of Patchouli and most other newly crushed green substance is chipping his departure, it should be borne wrist to endure it, but hatred is added to the right fragrance. His departure hours later reminded me of the ""dry down"" of oriental floral Madly Kenzo, perhaps for medicinal nuances (remedies) that both have at one point, that in my view. Your heart is amber, with amalgams of gross Mirra, those used at the foot of the Christmas tree in the festivities of the holiday season and that perfume the whole environment, also with resin touches that warm this phase and make Ambre Sultan an interesting scent in we instigates a onusta happiness. Finally, at the bottom, we can see sweetened aspects of Vanilla fused to benzoin in its natural form acquired from nature, still in latex form, something other than what we are used to feeling, since it refers to old thing, muffled and why not dusty? ! However, this sum, resulting in a combined evolution so exceptional that the need to have it is almost immediate, I can even doubt that it is void, and if it is for a minority. Ambre Sultan fixed and design absurdly good, all around feel and question the very unusual scent that hangs in the air when he in contact with the skin presents his most sublime way of being, ie, a fragrance that deservedly gets the rating it has in the world of niche fragrance as a ""sui generis"". Indeed, look for it, have a to call it yours.

I asked my husband what he thought and he first said -- you smell like potpourri...and then he twisted his face away and said yuck. i don't like it.

But i LOVE it. I feel transported to a log cabin in the middle of vermont apres-ski sitting around a nice warm fire, the smell of cinnamon and slightly herbal notes in the air, roasting marshmallows over the fire.

It's warm, sexy and spicy with a smokey sweet undertone that's perfectly balanced."

Whenever I spray this perfume I open again that violin box, I am again a little girl mesmerised by music and smells. And that scented memory is here again because of Ambre Sultan."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']",Great fragrance but the longevity and projection are very weak and soft .

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","There is a certain poetry to Ambre Sultan that resonates like the sound of Buddhist brass bowls - very long and echoing. Serge Lutens' perfume is a study of perfect balance. It is laid out like a wheel, with wood, fruit, incense, greens, and spices in equal measure. It makes for a linear incense-like smoky and rich perfume experience as only Sheldrake/Lutens can make, and it succeeds on every level. Deep, profound, intensely wearable, delicious, cloak-like, velvety, sharp, a hint of sour green. A wonderful perfume."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","I have been intrigued for a year, reading interesting reviews here, and thinking for sure it's something I would like, but may not be to versatile or dear, I already have some rich balsamic fragrances. From the reviews, notes, and Oriental theme, I was thinking, it's going to be heavy and dark, resinous, or realy sweet and I don't like sweet...
I heard alot of Lutens frags are very sweet. I have Fille en Aiguilles, and it is much sweeter than this one.

So I was a bit surprised. First impressions; it is predominantly Herbal and medicinal smelling, very niche and strange in a good way. It is like nothing else in my colection. I am very glad to have it. After a sample vile, my bottle is on it's way...

The reviews seem polarized and all over the place, understandably so. This is a true niche fragrance. I started thinking of niche as super expensive, quality, private blends etc. But isn't the true meaning of niche, being very unusual, not mainstream, where few are they who like them. Like Caron's ""Yatogan"" unusual, polarizing, difficult to recognize or understand. This is how I understand niche and Ambre Sultan.
It reminds me of "" Rien"" Etat Libre, a very strange niche fragrance. This one has that medicinal strangness, but is more grounded earthy, so I prefer Ambre Sultan. Performance; longevity is very good, I just purchased mine from fragrancenet, projection is average to obove avg. This is more versatile than TF Amber Absolute, because of the fresh herbs and spices. TF Amber Absolute has a masculine vib, whereas Ambre Sultan is totally a shared fragrance, like herbal tea, it's gender neutral.

It's not dark or heavy as I imagined it might be. It's not to sweet or sexy.
The spices and oregano do not make it smell like kitchen spices, but maybe exotic herbs, as in a Turkish market, yes.

I thought there would be no freshness to the fragrance looking at the note pyramid, but it does have some fresh spices, not quite citrus, but sour herbal fresh.
Because of the freshness, many say this works in the Summer heat as well, if you go light on the trigger.
From the Fragrantica note pyramid all the balsamic resins are on top, and herbs below, less dominant. I think the pyramid is upside down, the herbs should be on top, although it does have beutifull, rich, vanelic balsams and woods.

This frag realy evolves beautifully, after the herbal/ spicy top notes burn off a bit, 20 minutes in, the rich Amber shines, and the fully rounded heart accord takes shape. I love every stage of this fragrance. It may be an acquired taste, try befor buying if you can, otherwise go for a blind buy, this one is special and I think worth a risk...
Into my top 5 it goes !

At Kafkaesqueblog.com Zoli Zol writes a great description of Labdanum and beswax in Ambre Sultan. ""Nutty , chocolatey, resinous, leathery, cognac, rum, boozy, honey, toffy, animalistic, darkly syrupy"", I confirm those are all good adjectives that describe, Ambre Sultan, as well as herbal, medicinal, in the opening which I love also.

Update: After not having worn Ambre Sultan for a week, I'm so impressed, it's my #1 fragrance now. It is nicer than Amber Absolute, which is great I have a 50 ml, but Ambre Sultan has that same beautiful Amber, and so much more goodness...

I revisited this fragrance last month. What happened to me? I now find it beautiful and well-constructed. The dry herbs are the heroes here : they keep the resins in check and prevent the scent from veering towards the cloying ""sweet amber"" effect which many big ambers have. I find it pleasant and smooth (if a bit linear, but most Lutens' are like that and that's ok).

I wonder how many other fragrances I've disrespected and should now go apologize to..."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","I love this scent, very sexy and warm. Powerful at first but softens on the dry down. I love the way perfumes can evoke memories or even fantasies, it's fun to wear them to magnify an element of your persona. This is my mysterious seductress scent, just back from the orient in the 19th century or the scent of the vampire perhaps. To be honest most scents I love evoke this. This scent is both erotic and romantic, and perfect for the winter boudoir."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","What a warm and cozy scent. I'm delighted.

This is an office-friendly scent for me, as opposed to some amber colognes that can be way too much for an office setting.

This scent wraps me up like a blanket, and I also notice a suede-like scent to it. Like being wrapped in a suede blanket, if there's such a thing.

There really isn't much I can say here, I feel like this fragrance is worth more than the explanation I'm giving, but words to explain it kind of escape me. What I'm loving about Serge Lutens fragrances so far, is that they're simple in appearance, and complex but not challenging to the nose."

the benzoin takes a semi cloying note after a while (almost play-doh like...)

Layers and layers of desert incense burned over decades unfurl, true to the incense and not to the ash. As its essence diffuses, a true, real, delectable amber essence is unveiled in the presence of the wearer. The incense stays prominent longer on bare skin, and the amber prevails handsomely from beneath garments. The incense makes this the type of amber men can wear with confidence. It's rigorously masculine. It's Valentino in The Sheik."

This is weirdly the epitome of the dark side of what a well-blended perfume can be--a cloying sickly-sweet soup.
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","I've held off on trying Serge Lutens because I knew I would fall in love with this line. Ambre Sultan is actually the second SL that I've tried, after Sa Majeste la Rose, and it's just amazing. It's powerful, confident, fierce.

MKK mellows the oriental aspects of Ambre Sultan and adds a outdoorsy, smoky vibe to the whole mix. Alone, MKK is just too...BO, but combined with Ambre Sultan, it's absolutely perfect. And they can be layered pancake style, rather than side-by-side. Christopher Sheldrake is a genius."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","Reformulation warning. I repurchased a bottle, recently, and it was like when a bottle of soda goes flat. It had all of the superficial characteristics of Ambre Sultan, but without any fizz or depth. The herbal facets in the opening are barely there, the drydown is mostly a generic, synthetic, sweet amber. The new bottle also had a significantly weaker formula, inside, in terms of sillage and longevity. It might just be an age issue (I ordered from a site at significant discount rather than from SL site) because I have no way of knowing how long this sat in a warehouse. But after reading some recent reviews, I wonder if some people are only sampling this inferior product because my original bottle was extraordinary."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","My first impression is it very resinous and I am picking up a lot of amber, like one would expect.

Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","First of all this is a shared perfume. This is one of those that I bought right when it first came out because I had gotten ahold of a bottle of ambergris tincture from 1968 from the estate of a perfumer and fell totally in love with that smell and knew I could never replace it so I began trying every amber or ambergris perfume I could get my hands on each time impatiently waiting for the base notes with my fingers crossed just hoping for that smell I had grown (and still very much am) obsessed with. Well, since this perfume does not seem to contain any ambergris at all, I was obviously not all that happy with it but I did like the smell and wore it daily for several weeks. Then suddenly the fragrance started to bother me. It is definitely a rich, spicy aromatic blend of resins and is one of the best representations of what is meant by an ""amber note."" So if you are looking for a somewhat spicy, but not in a harsh way, pure amber perfume that is rich, warm and long lasting, then this would be a great one to start with. Of course because Serge Lutens perfumes are not cheap, and they are very unique I find that it's easy to love or hate each one, so I always get a sample or better yet a 5ml decant to wear it a couple days first. Then I also know if I want to buy the 50ml spray bottle or the 75ml bell jar. My ambergris obsession lives on and to this day I wear pure natural ambergris tincture on my left arm almost every day, but only once in a great while my precious 1968."

For me is the olfactive transposition of a protective and warm coat in the coldest winter; the fabric is a soft cashmere, hot, not soft like a velvet, but only slightly coarse (bay leaf, coriander and oregano); then the balsamic development, with the softness and cozyness of the vanilla and benzoin.
It's like a meditation scent (i would sniff my wrist for hours), and a protecting shield from the unpleasentness outside....

AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE! !!"
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","I'm extremely thankful to our dear co-member nexangelus for gifting me a bunch of samples to try out, just because of my recent interest in Serge Lutens fragrances :)
This is the first sample I tried out of the bunch and I already feel like giving my first impression!
I notice that my tastes are changing and I'm getting more interested in niche as they tend to offer something completely different from the mainstream brands.
Ambre Sultan opens with a spice overload on my skin with dominant aromatic bay leaf and myrrh, which can come off as pungent. More spicy than ambery. It stays like this for about two hours after which it finally changes for the better. The spices tone down, amber and resins come more to the surface and by now it's way more wearable for me. Another hour in and I get whiffs of what reminds me of cacao??? It's not listed and probably not even part of the composition, yet that is what I smell. It balances and rounds out the scent and makes me wish it would smell like this from the very opening. I'm not a big fan of very spicy scents, that's why. I would like Ambre Sultan to be more about the amber right off the bet, less spicy, less sharp, more balmy and more sweet like the dry down.
Maybe I just need to give my 'to spices untrained nose' a little more time to get used to the spicy stuff, in order to like it better in time...
The dry down of AS is wonderful, but I don't think I would really enjoy spending over 2 hours wearing this before I get there... yet, maybe some day... :)"
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","I've been on an amber kick lately. I have gotten and fallen in love with AG Amber Fetich; Amber 411, Ambre Russe among others. I blind bought the beloved SL Amber Sultan and it did not meet my expectations AT ALL. On my skin it was very dusty, herbal, vegetal and bitter. It is only vaguely balsamic. I assume the coriander, bay leaf and oregano overpowered everything else. Very disappointing."
Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens (unisex) ~ 2000,"['amber', 'aromatic', 'fresh spicy', 'balsamic', 'woody', 'warm spicy']","I finally got this and wow, it smells just as I'd hoped! I'm new to Serge Lutens and this was actually a blind buy, but after looking at the notes, I just knew it would be a winner, so I didn't hesitate on ordering it.

I couldn't help but spray a little bit on me when I opened it. It's a little strong at first, but I don't think it's overwhelming. Very lovely, resinous, and thick. I kinda reminds me of Ormonde Jayne's Tolu in a way. Both are very resinous and warm, so fans of it might like Ambre Sultan as well. IMO, this is not a summer scent at all; it's best for late fall and winter, but, a person could wear it on summer nights, maybe by a bonfire. It's a little smoky and incensy on me at first. As it settles, it gets more ""golden"", more ambery. The dry down is a little dark on me; yeah, it has a Goth vibe about it, at least on my skin. This is based on first impression, so I'll update on longevity and sillage when I can give it a proper wearing. Oh, and I know it's for women, but men, you can easily wear this one too. So far, I'm curious to try more Serge Lutens!"

finally got my first private blend today and what a way to start my journey for the private blend.
blind buy just like all my TF collection and love at first sniff. and straight in to my all time favourite of course.

couldn't say about sillage and longevity, only got to test it on my hand but what a smell! I get a woody earthy ( wet earthy) smell. I can not stop sniffing my hand right now.

I actually gave up on trying to find one I could actually love. I mean this is a designer fragrance, gah! The prices for them make it difficult to justify finding one that I can I love. So I gave up.
Then I found this one & I absolutely love it. I can actually agree with all the positive reviews on this one so there’s nothing more to add. If you like woody & oud.. This is at least a must try. It’s certainly masculine but FBW IMHO."

It is a tiny, sinister statue of a scent in an empty room where the temperature drops suddenly, with no explanation.

I see it in a fresh new way, a better way...

Early in ny collecting, I tried the old Oud Wood, and was very impressed initially.
Then it fell out of favor for me , and I sold my bottle.
I though it smelled unnatural, a concofany of synthetics and some natural notes.

I purchased a small spray decant to try it from time to time. Now I think I may purchase a bottle again...

It reminded me of YSL M-7. A semi sweet Oud and vanilla, a more mass apealing Oud, yet an Oud dominant fragrance.

What sets Oud Wood apart from M-7 is a strong Cardomom and peppery presence as piquant note.

So it smells more natural to me now as an Oud and Cardomom fragrance. I've come to like Cardomom spice as in Diptyque Eau Duelle, but it's stronger here."

Prior to being sprayed with Oud Wood at the Tom Ford counter of my local Bloomingdales, I had no idea what to expect aside from the rep telling me it is by far their best seller. Immediately upon smelling my wrist, it didn't trigger any kind of excitement or ""wow"" factor, but instead made me wonder what in the actual hell she just sprayed on me. As I continued through the mall, my nose kept leading me back to my wrist; over and over again, back to my wrist. I was hooked, fascinated and didn't want it to end. Its allure is still one that I find very hard to explain, only that it feels as if it always existed somewhere, perhaps remote or hidden, just waiting to be inhaled and revered. As I've heard mentioned before, it's as much an aura or vibe as it is a scent. Now owning this, I can't imagine being without it. If ever there is a day when I cannot access this fragrance, it will be a sad day indeed. IMO, a masterpiece.

Yes, the projection and longevity issues are real, but if you truly love the scent as I do, you buy it, reapply it as necessary and take it for what it is because there is simply nothing that smells quite like Oud Wood."

I discovered it through reviews on here and from buying a 15ml sample. It truly is beautiful but (and it is a huge BUT), on me it has the worst performance of any fragrance I own (and I own many). Even if I douse myself in it and also use the Oud Wood deoderant in liberal amounts, it becomes a skin scent in 30 minutes. Fragrance usually always lasts on me throughout the day but this is sadly, a joke when it comes to any longevity or sillage. For a masterpiece costing this much, this should deliver far, far better performance and this simply isn't good enough and constitutes a terrible waste of money!"

And I’m here to say that this is a good thing!.., because, over the past week since, I have been testing it and found that my initial thoughts were incorrect... how incorrect?.. well lets just say I now own a 100ml bottle of it.

The first time I tried it for some unknown reason I got this “womans makeup bag” scent in the background from it.. but, everyday I have applied it since, I haven’t had the same makeup bag experience.. Maybe it reacted with something else on my skin on that first occassion which gave off a different scent?.

Anyway... i now love this stuff.

One thing I will add.. 3 sprays (1 on back of neck, 1 on the inside of each elbow) and it lasts 10 hours on me.. pretty happy about that given the comments from others saying they struggle to get 4-5hrs..

Also.. Tried TF Oud Wood Intense today.. totally different scent, they shouldnt have really called it Oud Wood intense they shouldve given it a different name altogether.. but i dont mind it either to be honest."

It contains some absolute beauties such as Fabulous and Jasmin Rougue but this was disappointing. I'm very picky when it comes to oud perfumes because most are knock offs and use cheap ingredients. This is no exception.

The overall scent is strong and powerful but it lacks the oud intensity in longevity. For £120+ I expected much more than just a simple fragrance which has a nice opening but no more. The opening wears off within 30 mins so it's a poor performer. Didn't really turn heads either."

Opening: It smells like opening a new bottle of a stinky vitamin. There's no other scent on earth that smells like a pungent bottle of stinky vitamins you're going to loathe taking every morning.

MId: Vitamin still coming through strong, but now it's shifted into a weird rubber scent. Like a tire.

Full dry down: Kind of like opening a new action figure from the 80's. A pulsing plastic, pvc, or rubber smell. Like a sickly sweetness and dampness too.

Crazy right? That's all I smell. No oud. No wood. And this is why I love this hobby. We all bring something different to our experience with the fragrance."

Doesn't smell like any other Oud out there, but I think thats the reason I still wear it on daily basis as signature scent. Because it really smells different, like I never smell any other parfum out there yet similar to this one.

Longetivity moderate, around 3-4 hours strong projectivity before it fades. Stays in fabric much much longer than my skin. But from my experience the 2015 batch that I had do stays longer on my skin compared to the latest one I brought.

From what I know, this batch with grey bottle, and silver text is a reformulation from the original 2007 batch which had a brown bottle and gold colored text. I wonder how these original batch from 2007 smells like because people said it smells kinda different."

I do like this, it's unique, definitely very Unisex and to me, kind of an anytime fragrance. Seems most people like this in cooler weather, I typically reach for this in the Spring.

I wear this in combination with a roll-on ""Wood Fragrance Enhancer"" from JYCTY, which is an independent fragrance maker here in Toronto Canada. With the enhancer, it improves the smell just slightly and I get a decent 2 hours of projection before it just sits on the skin.

Without the enhancer, I'm lucky to smell it for 30 mins. Even Jo Malone colognes perform longer than this supposed EDP.

The scent is nice but it's hard to justify the price with that performance.

You won't get compliments with this and the couple times I've smelled it on people, it was so obviously Oud Wood that I feel it's more like that expression ""sometimes you wear the fragrance, sometimes the fragrance wears you"". I think that says it all about this one, at least on me and the few I've smelled it on."

However, it is completely gone from my skin in 4 hours. I get better performance from the original Colonia...which should be embarrassing for tom ford as ADP is a fresh and citrusy Eau de Cologne. Both my nose and those of others cannot pick up any trace of this on my skin past the 4 hour mark. I do get better longevity on clothing, but projection is so soft that no one can really notice it anyway. Darn shame that a darker fragrance that smells so good performs so poorly in both projection and longevity. Not worth a repeat the purchase because of that.

For one thing, Oud Wood wears quite light - nothing like an EDP and feels more like a 'all weather cologne' (a bit like Endymion but actually not even performing as well as that and in many respects needing a bit of heat to lift the fragrance off the skin now); secondly, I remember the yellow label version and this truly felt like an EDP - never crazy heavy like TV or TL but definitely more dense and better projecting than now. It is nothing like that now - not even having the durability that it had or one would expect at this price.

Lastly, OW is actually one of the most acclaimed fragrances of all time on various forums and sites - and no doubt it is beautiful and will be found under many Christmas trees again this year. But I firmly believe this has become a fairly significant con-job in its current iteration. Seriously, the mark-up on perfumes is already enormous - so on Oud Wood it must be nothing less than price-gouging with the changes that have occurred. If Fragrantica really was able to affect some change for perfume consumers it should direct the attention of Estee Lauder to what long-term consumers are thinking about this fragrance.

Glad it was a gift - at least in its current state....And hope it returns to what it once was too. (BTW, don't kid yourself that you are getting anything like this with Versace Oud Noir - the Versace is good but not that good.)"

When you wear this perfume .. smells of rosewood and cardamom, mixed with Chinese pepper, are very fierce, to surround you directly with a wonderful warmth that you feel directly. The heart of the fragrance is a smoky mixture of rare oud wood, sandalwood, vetiver, and tonka bean in addition to vanilla and amber. The initial emission moment of this fragrance is very exciting and intense with the scent of incense, with the timidity of the emergence of the rosewood scent, which seizes periods after periods to appear strongly accompanied by cardamom. The intensity of the fragrance does not remain long ""despite this conflict because the amazing thing about it is that it is surrounded by the scent of sandalwood lurking behind the vetiver and which is very siege, which is easy for them to colonize hearts before the smells easily because of their ability to control in the darkest of circumstances .. And despite all this remains light plankton of incense in The atmosphere is an oaky nature, woody essence and earthy emission that evokes a pleasant intimacy in the soul that everyone who inhales a whiff of this striking aroma becomes familiar with it. Amber and vanilla will love this fragrance, when you put it on your wrist it lasts from eight hours to twelve hours depending on the air temperature and the type of skin as you know, then the smell gradually fades away, but a little remains before your wrist reverently as a sign of the strength and stability of this perfume.

A couple years ago I had the incredible opportunity to live on Via Cola di Rienzo in Rome, a bustling upscale shopping street 5 minutes walk from the Vatican. Each evening I would stop by a particularly well-stocked profumeria and select a fragrance to sample for the day.
It was a crisp fall day, and I remember standing on a bus some time after spraying Oud Wood on my wrist, thinking somebody smelled amazing. I kept getting whiffs of something woody and mysterious, light and playful. A few stops later the smell was still there and I realized it was me. Though I usually try not to smell myself too much, I could not help but sneak furtive sniffs the rest of the night.
Being young and without means, the next day I went to a different perfume shop to sample Oud Wood again without feeling pressure to purchase. Again I was struck by the beauty of it.
Since then time has passed, and I am no longer in Rome. Feeling sentimental, I ordered a sample and waited in anticipation for that smell I loved so much. Sadly, when I sprayed the sample, it simply was not the same. At first I wondered if it was just my sentimentality getting in the way, but the more I have sprayed it the past few weeks, the more I am convinced the magic is lost.
The scent now is similar, but it feels more transparent. I think the beauty of it came in the richness it once had - too opaque to smell all the way through - and therefore mysterious. Now, it is sheer, and while nice, rather ordinary. Whereas I once smelled sweet woods (not oud, but definitely wood), I now get something more akin to dark cherry cola.

It’s classy, bold but easy to wear and versatile woody with oud scent. I don’t know if there’s real oud but I can definitely smell the oud note.

But very disappointed by its performance. It stays very close to the skin and only last 4-6 hours then scent is all gone. I don’t know if it’s because of my skin chemistry since I have medium skin tone and a little dry. I cannot justify its cost since it’s at a niche price. Scent is nice tho.

There is a synthetic note that reminds me of rubber that I can catch from time to time which brings down the enjoyment for me, but because its fleeting it doesn't entirely negate the experience.
Unfortunately the longevity is pretty poor on my skin. The sillage is decent but closer to the intimate side of things. It's overall lovely but I can't see myself buying a full bottle due to its performance and price. Maybe I'll try the intense version.

(review in construction during my exp. with it)

-Definitely has REAL white/szechuan pepper in it, and it has that scent about that smells more foodie than one would want to like to wear, it also is over-powering and takes away the beauty of the Oud note. There is also a stinky funky sour note to it and it's not pleasant! I don't know if that's real oud or synthetic, i can't see them spending the money on using real oud, the thought of this disappoints me and makes me not want to support investing money into the frag. I can't see a women liking this note on a man as it makes him smell dirty gross. I need to get my hands on real oud to know what it really smells like.

------

2nd spray, will expand the review with more exp to give it an authentic review to give the frag justice.

STRONG opening, packs a punch! No alcohol on opening, goes straight to a funky-sour note, id assume that's oud or synthetic oud. Followed by a strong new-car leather note that i recognize from Ford's 'Tuscan Leather' frag.
Then as it starts to dry down to the mid notes something really sweet-sour rises that isn't pleasant, yet intriguing - then after a few mins that note fades away.

Mid notes start to develop where you get hints of vanilla, cardamon, rosewood and amber. It's now smoothing out and is quiet beautiful actually. A hay-like scent is now coming into play, is that the Vetiver i'm now smelling?

Didn't like it on first spray in the store, ran from it right away.
At home testing it again today, im enjoying it. But i feel like this is a half-assed/half-baked frag that needed more work on before they released it. Therefore, this is completely over-hyped. I like this, but i do not love this.
I wonder if he uses real oud? Id like that very much if Tom Ford's line did.
Need more exp with it to give you guys a final opinion & rating."

let me start by saying I've owned a lot of Tom Ford fragrances. I used to spend my money like nothing back in the day. these days I don't buy $400+ fragrances much anymore because I'm smarter with my money.
today however my wife randomly surprised me with a big 100ml bottle of Tom Ford Oud Wood which retails in Australia for $485. some people earn that in a week of work! so buying this you would expect something grand.
Tom Fords Oud Wood used to be one of my favourites, it was there back when I had only 4 or 5 fragrances in my collection (now I have 50 or so).
it was worn by me sooo much. it was amazing, it was so unique, it was an acquired smell & it was strong and projected its uniqueness unapologetically!

so my wife asks me to close my eyes because she got me a surprise,
what a wonderful suprise, just looking at the bottle I was already taken back to when we were dating.
I opened it up (this was 10 mins ago) I sprayed one spray on my inner forearm for me and one on my neck for her.. (that's what I said as a playful joke as I sprayed), we were so excited. $485 but where was it? where was the oud wood? what the f happened? it's soft, it's pleasant...but it's not the amazing oud wood and it's certainly not a $485 fragrance.

why would they use the same name and make something that is nothing like what that amazing fragrance was?
I'm 10 mins in and it's already fading away and it's just ""ok"" really.

there's no love, there's no amazing .. it's gone.
I won't call this oud wood & I won't sing praise to Tom Ford fragrances to my friends anymore
and you know what? I just want to let them know that yes they saved a few dollars by changing this the way they have. but guess what? I don't think I will buy another Tom Ford fragrance anymore. I'll take it as perhaps all my favourites are reformulated and I won't re-stock when they finish. my 100ml tobacco vanille is nearly finished. I wore that one on my wedding day 7 years ago but I'm out.

I'll politely tell the sales associate at the Tom Ford boutique and see what she says or what she offers to do but if they don't turn me around. I'm done and out!"

Mostly when fragrances companies make a successful fragrances by time they ruin them by reformulation and replace the ingredients by less quality ingredients and selling them nearly at the same price!"

Cmon Estee Lauder. You should be ashamed of yourselves.

This was one of my first loves form the TF line, this, Tuscan Leather and Italian Cypress..

This is not even close to that fragrance I bought all those years ago. This is just a cardamon and sichuan pepper bomb. There is no roundness, depth, warmth, no performance, NADA!!! Non of that charm and complexity we all loved in what seems like, a very long time ago.

Basically, the entire TF private line has gone to shit. The originals anyway. Dont get me started on what happened to Noir de Noir and Tuscan Leather. Ill lose my shit. No one was a bigger fan of those than me.

Now.... I have completely gone off TF. His new releases are a joke. What are they? They have no purpose. No direction. Just flavours in a bottle. Only saving graces are White Suede and Ombre Leather which has clearly superseded Tuscan Leather.

Almond > Cherry > Peach. WTF????? Really. Get it together over there. Cheap and tacy perfumery at its worst. Especially from a powerhouse like TF.

I hope someone at Estee Lauder reads this and reads it good. I'm sure I speak for thousands of TF enthusiasts out there on how disappointed and jaded they all are regarding TF these days; EL and TF are losing lots of love and $$$ and won't be getting any back.

Oud Wood is sharp, woody, smoky and resinous -- its overall simple and linear but executed with perfection. As usual, Tom Ford's use of Oud is undetectable here, as he has simply perfected how to work around this note without making the overall fragrance smell middle eastern or plasticky. I absolutely admire and respect that. However, the name is a bit misleading as this one is all about rosewood, vetiver and leather (birch tar) smoothen out by amber, tonka and spices. Absolutely Fantastic.

Like most people, I have to admit that Oud Wood is a beautiful Tom Ford creation that has almost universal appeal. It's woody, chocolatey, luxurious and slight smokey at the end. Another issue is the price. The private blends are super pricey and to me it doesn't perform enough to justify that price bracket.

Then I gradually lost interest, disliking it, and selling my gold label bottle. Some of my favorite fragrances I didn't like at all on first impressions: Like Yatogan, I laughed at how ridiculous it smelled, then I gradually came to love it.
It was the opposite with Oud Wood, its flashy and impressive on first impression, then I realized how artificial the flashiness is.
I recently purchased a 10 ml that Tom Ford sells now, just to smell it now and then.

The reason I lost interest is that there are NO recognizable notes except cardomon perhaps. It smells like buttered popcorn, and marzipan accord.
There is no Oud, synthetic oud, or any recognizable wood here, and I've reviewed 500 fragrances.
Its a virtual oud, and a vertual fecal note, that gives it a sensual anamalic vib.
This strange scent that is TF Oud Wood is interesting, and I understand the worldly appeal of it. It just bothers me that it's so unnatural. I had to put on some Le Labo Bergamote 22, to smell something fresh and natural to recover from Oud Wood.

The new reformulated black label, is a shadow of the original. Maybe not so bad, but performance is weaker for sure.

I will enjoy my 10 ml from time to time, best in cold Winter. It is unusual, nothing like it, except Naxos, had this synthetic cocaine/ Oud Wood vib going on as well. I didn't like Xarjof Naxos as well. They smell good, but I just dont like the way I feel about them at times."

The performance was below my ""worst case scenario"" expectations!!! I should put my nose on my skin and give it a deep inhale to smell it properly.

Those who've described it as seductive, sexy, and masculine are spot-on.

I love that I don't have anything else in my perfume arsenal that smells like it. The cardamom, vetiver, pepper, and rosewood are the most dominant notes in the opening.

I don't smell the warmer notes (sandalwood, amber, tonka bean) until the latter part of the dry-down.

I didn't start paying attention to oud scents until last year, because I found them rather overpowering and more on the masculine side.

This scent, on the first spray, is intense and spicy. It leaves a noticeable trail. As soon as I smelled it, I gave it to my husband.

Use a light hand and give it at least 30 mins to dry down, as it's less sharp and much sexier/seductive. Otherwise, it will be much too strong in spaces where you're in close proximity to others.

I don't see myself wearing it as it's too masculine for my taste, but I love, love, love it on my husband.

Do not buy without testing, as that's much too high a price to blind-buy something you may not like."

I've never had a signature scent. Ever.

But this could easily be a signature scent if one is inclined to it. And this is due to the fact that it's a shy/discrete interpretation of a bold concept. It's not overpowering or cloying in warm weather and it's perfect for cool and cold weather.

It's a perfect balance between light and bold, in my opinion. There's an ""airy heaviness"" aura in it.

It has the ""woody"" facet of agarwood, more than anything fecal or animalic or cheesy.

Gorgeous fragrance!

On my skin... excelent performance! But be warned: it's not loud by nature (nothing to do with reformulation only).

10/10



ps.: I want to make an observation about formulations: I think the current version of Oud Wood is closer to the original formulation than Amber Absolute, for example - people say that the new AA is the same scent watered down, but I think they actually changed the scent (slightly, but it's noticeable). I don't get such a change in Oud Wood.

Oud Wood is the quintessence of gender-bending scents created by Tom Ford in his marketed ""Private Blend"" collection released in 2007.

Tbh, it is one the classiest and most sophisticated woody scents I've ever smelled so far. 😍 This is such a statement piece and woods are prevalent from top notes to dry down. For me, the dry down is the prettiest part! The agarwood or oud is known to be complex and heavy however, Tom Ford made it tamed. What I love about TF Oud Wood is its quality, it's really really really well-blended and polished! ❤️💯

But here's the catch, this fragrance is weak. 🤦🏻♂️ It projects only for minutes then the scent became so close to the skin. And for a retail price tag of ₱12,600 for 50ml bottle which is available at Rustan's, it just proved that TF Oud Wood is also the quintessence of social inequality. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼 Thank you, next!"

With Oud Wood by TF I associate an oriental house with a lot of ebony figures.

It stays that way for an hour or so, then dries down to a just barely there skin scent on me. After 5 hours, it’s still here but just barely as I said.

For a Tom Ford fragrance, you would have hoped for more for the price.

More scent, more sillage, more projection, more longevity.

It’s a nice woodsy scent with a slight hint of almost incense like smoke. Smells like a slightly more upscale men’s body wash or something. It’s a nice scent, but is it worth the price? I don’t think so. I think one could definitely find better value for the money.

So TFOW is a warm smooth scent. It’s one that I like but I wouldn’t purchase it. I just think it’s not “enough” to justify its price tag.

And as for the oud? I don’t get anything dirty or animalic in this fragrance. Pleasant and soft slightly smoky woods—- almost a campfire type scent.

Masculine yes, but totally unisex to me. I think this would be nice on men and women."

It smells very much like a sweet Oudy shower gel. Definitely clean, and there are very mild traces of Oud, which is very calm and not animatic whatsoever, definitely mass-appealing. I wouldn’t consider this an Oud fragrance. The sweetness is a woody sweetness, most likely from the Sandalwood.

Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","Tom Ford Oud Wood opens with a moderate projection of very pleasant woody accords. The opening is woody and sweet; the combination of wood notes is fantastic, the oud found in this fragrance is delicate and far from dark, pungent or animalic. With the woody notes, the sweet accords come up creating a very pleasant and winter/fall wearable scent. The woody accords can be described as a combination of dark, fresh and very aromatic woods. The vanilla and Tonka bean are the two more prominent sweet tones, both give the fragrance a moderate sweet and delicious accord. The pepper and cardamon are there to support the featured notes, the Sichuan pepper feels spicy but not anywhere near as spicy as black pepper; similarly, the cardamom adds just a soft touch that enhances the woody accords. A few moments after the opening, the amber enters the blend creating a soft, sweet, projecting accord. The vetiver described as a note is barely noticeable. The fragrance is linear, the only noticeable change from the opening to the dry-down is the development of the amber which occurs towards the dry-down. Once Tom Ford Oud Wood has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a mildly sweet, moderate projecting woody fragrance with soft spicy accords. The fragrance feels modern, versatile, elegant, unisex, inviting, well-blended, wearable, and very pleasant.

BATCH REVIEWED: 2019
WOW RATING: 9/10. This is a very pleasant woody fragrance; this is probably as pleasant as a wood-based fragrance can get. The agarwood feels more like dark wood than animalic oud.
DISLIKE RATING: 1/10. It is very unlikely that this fragrance will feel offensive to anyone.
UNIQUENESS: 9/10. Woody fragrances are common; however, Tom Ford Oud Wood is a fragrance that makes wood accords very wearable.
MASS APPEAL: 9/10. This is a crowds-pleaser fragrance.
PROJECTION: 3/10. Low to moderate. About three feet around the wearer.
SILLAGE: 3/10. Low to moderate. About three feet behind the wearer.
APPLICATION: Four atomizations should suffice.
LONGEVITY: 4/10. About 4 hours with 2 hours of moderate projection.
SEASONS: Spring, fall, colder nights, or climate-controlled environments.
OCCASIONS: Formal events, outdoor gatherings, office, business, casual, holidays, home, romantic, dating. This is an office-friendly fragrance
VERSATILITY: 9/10. This fragrance feels very versatile, ideal for almost any occasion.
GENDER: Unisex. Tom Ford Oud Wood is a very refined fragrance. The soft spicy and oud accords create a slight tilt to the masculine side.
AGES: 30 and above.
RECOMMENDATION: Tom Ford can be found discounted for about $300 for a 3.4oz bottle. The cost/value balance is out of proportion, however, it is a great scent. If money is not a problem, this is a good investment. Otherwise consider alternative. This is a nice to have, but not a must-have.
BLIND-BUY: Yes, but only if you are familiar with its main notes.
SIMILAR: Here are some examples of fragrances with soft wood notes. Bvlgari Man (no the Black version) EDT includes softwood and fruity notes; Cuba Gold Men EDT is an affordable woody, floral and spicy fragrance; Guerlain L'Homme Ideal EDP includes softwoods, almond, and other notes; Hugo Boss - Boss The Scent Absolute EDP features woody, ginger, and rum notes; Terre D'hermes EDT Spray, is orange and grapefruit based but it contains soft/sweet wood tones as well; Prada Luna Rossa Black Men EDP is a mostly peppery and woody fragrance; Tom Ford Oud Wood is a very pleasant, soft woody fragrance, however, very pricy; Acqua di Parma Men Colonia Quercia is a great woody, and spicy fragrance; Pasha de Cartier Edition Noire is an elegant and versatile, slightly sweet, ambery, aquatic, and woody fragrance. Xerjoff More Than Words is an oud, sweetly fruity, floral, and ambergris, a good but overpriced fragrance.
SUMMARY: Mildly sweet, moderate projecting woody fragrance with soft spicy accords. The fragrance feels modern, versatile, elegant, unisex, inviting, well-blended, wearable, and very pleasant."

I get a lovely fresh oud off the top, easily my favorite part of the fragrance. This transitions into a collection of notes that eventually become its base to my nose (no distinct mid notes): tonka, some amber with cardamom prominent. Oud is more or less gone 15 minutes in and becomes quite sweet bordering on gourmond.

As a rule, I don't like sweet frags, vanilla and amber are two notes I usually stay away from, and this definitely isn't my speed as a result. Wish this had more oud and a bit more complexity otherwise in the base."

Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","Having encountered so much praise for this online (particularly here) and having tried this in-store and been 'whelmed' (neither over- nor under-) I bought a number of samples from a respected retailer, expecting this would inevitably lead to a bigger investment. After various tests, the result is no further purchase. This IS a beautiful fragrance, but is it as good at being 'Oud Wood' as ""Tuscan Leather' is at being TL? Not in a million years.

Oud and rose is a well-worn (eastern) combination, but there's a smoothness or creaminess about the oud here, rounded out by the texture of the tonka and vanilla, that really works well. Though listed as unisex, this works better on a man, I think. The flipside of this 'unisex imbalance' for a woman would be Jo Malone's Velvet Rose & Oud which works better on women and is more potent (though less complex - which doesn't at all matter if you can't actually SMELL the TF incarnation).

It's true that oud is still pretty unusual as a main element in Western fragrances, and there's nothing exactly like this but there ARE alternatives - the 'reminds me ofs' above are close and the Versace is probably the best mainstream Western oud in terms of performance and price. An Eastern-style alternative oud fragrance, to my mind, would be Rasasi's Faqat Lil Rijal which shares some notes with Oud Wood but has some very interesting geranium in there too. I'm not suggesting the Rasasi is a clone/dupe (in the way La Yiqawam clearly is for Tuscan Leather) but it's a similar type of fragrance that's equally complex, sophisticated and un-synthetic but with better performance and better price point.

In summary, the fragrance is wonderful but weak: the level of projection, sillage and longevity make the price point an insult to even the most devoted Tom Ford followers. Perhaps it would be a perfect signature scent for a very brand-conscious guy in an office environment where people might complain about strong fragrances; the oud isn't the 'pongy' barnyard type.

I can see why there was a need for Oud Wood Intense, so perhaps that's another one to try, but this one certainly is not going to be added to my collection."

Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","Oud, sandalwood and rosewood are a great combo. Not surprisingly it's the oud that hits you first then the rosie rosewood. Rosewood and sandalwood are notes I really enjoy. The vetiver is strong as well but really comes into its own after half and hour.

Gradually the oud eases off a bit and then the spice and pepper come through. It's not quite as heavy. Let's be honest here it opens very strong. It's so heavy it makes me think of Serge Lutens Borneo after a load of spices have been added. There is a green element from the vetiver that combined with the wood notes makes me think of aromatic notes.

It doesn't really develop much. It remains an intense spicy oud/rosewood/sandalwood bomb. Vanilla is listed but it's presence is pretty much minimal on my skin. I'd have never guessed it was present.

I get good longevity and sillage. I guess it's unisex if you like your oud. I would say though that it touches a tad to the masculine. It's definitely a fragrance to only wear in cool/cold conditions as it's quite intense but if you live in a hot environment then this will hang around a while."

Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","Agree with the review below by the Smell of Derbyshire (EDIT: this is now quite far below since this review has been re-uploaded).

This is disappointingly middle of the road.

Nothing unpleasant but I wasn't expecting this to smell like it does. It's a waxy, rubbery fragrance that is a nice blend of lighter woods - I expected/hoped for something a bit richer, denser, darker. It has a creamy-woodiness (the sandalwood and rosewood makes for a nice mix) and the Oud is very tasteful i.e. easy to wear, and very light. Not much Oud at all. Perhaps it's overly synthetic in the way you don't really get the pungency I associate with a good quality Oud note - nearly all Oud is synthetic in perfumery but some capture more of the 'stank' than others.

Thankfully, that tyre-rubber smell does calm down fairly quickly. It does develop into a nicer scent - the creamy woods are more prominent, with a bit more sweetness. But 'nicer' isn't particularly exciting either...it just feels like it's 60% of the way to a really great fragrance, but no more than 60%. And perhaps that's the point. Perhaps that's the whole point. It's mass appealing, safe, 'nice', with enough luxury and richness in the fragrance to adhere to Tom Ford's marketing shtick.

The sweetness from the tonka and vanilla makes this unisex for sure, but I'm not sure how many women this would suit. It definitely leans more masculine, but for a man, this is a pleasant, pleasing scent that could be described as slightly feminine despite the focus on woods. From a distance there's something floral about it. It's not the 'mainstream yet deep and woody' fragrance I was hoping for at all. (UPDATE: Bois Marocain is a lot closer to that.)

Longevity and projection is ridiculously poor. Lasts 3-4 hours of wearable/detectable scent, 6-8 hours if you're being very generous and really, really digging your nose in to your skin. And I mean really digging - just to get a trace of spicy, oudy woods. Maybe 20-30 minutes of projection: genuinely, it's poor, but I'm not sure that's necessarily a bad thing. I think this works nicely as a skin scent (reformulation issues have surely neutralised it) and is a reward for close proximity - greetings, farewells etc. Sillage obviously non-existent as a result. Again, I'll repeat: for a scent like this, that's not a bad thing.

Disappointing overall then, for me. It's a 'like' in as much as it's a decent fragrance but not something I'm going to buy a full bottle of. Hoping Oud Wood Intense and Tobacco Oud have more going for them (UPDATE: they do)...have a number of other TF samples arriving next week and I'm hoping they're better than this (UPDATE: some yes, some no).

I'd echo the poster below once more and say if this was £80-100 for 100ml, I'd give this a solid 8-9/10. It's very wearable and appealing with enough nuance to it that it's going to stand out against designer brands.

But it's not. In the UK at the moment, it's £240 for 100ml - and in that case, it's a 5/10. As I said, it's two thirds of the way to something really good with the cost knocking some points off.

However, I can say right now that I think this is a grower - I've found with many Tom Ford scents, there is 'something' about them that, despite their mass appeal (or perhaps because of it?) it's easy to get comfortable with them. It's easy to really 'wear' them, to get used to them, for the fragrance to become 'you' and yours. Particularly if you're not someone who wants to collect more than 10+ bottles. I can totally see how this can go from a 'hmm, nice' to 'THIS is what I wear when I dress up/go out' etc.

I'm going to persist with this and come back and update.

UPDATE 13/4/19: Alas, I cannot get on board with this. I want to like this - I want a classy, dry woody scent, with the mainstream appeal yet distinction that TF's PB produces, in my opinion. For some people this clearly achieves those things, but not for me.

It's simply not...*special*...enough. Having sampled a good chunk of the TF Private Blend line, including Oud Wood Intense which is very intoxicating and slightly challenging, this isn't worth a full bottle. Oud Intense isn't what I wanted, and it plays it a bit 'close' to the dirty/funky line with the animalic note, but if ONLY Oud Wood intense had gone further down the deeper/darker woods route it might be a really great 9/10 fragrance. There are no doubt some who will love this, some who see this as a 'aspirational' purchase, and other who 'need' it in a collection etc. But unless you adore it and consider this a signature scent I would consider many other TF PB fragrances over this - at which point it becomes redundant and/or a vanity/money-burning purchase.

I'd also say the Tom Ford DNA is slightly jarring with this scent. Others, like Amber Absolute, it smells great. With this...I'm less of a fan.

As a side note - it's already said elsewhere - but unless this is one of your favourite fragrances, just buy Versace Oud. Or, better yet, look to something like Armani Oud Royal, which does this 'palatable designer Oud' so much better, if you're unwilling to jump off the deep end in to niche ouds.

Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","I can only describe this as mind-blowing when you first wear it on your skin. When I first started on my fragrance journey about 6 months ago, I was in a department store and the name intrigued me so I sprayed it on. My mind was blown, I didn’t know people could smell like this (I live in an area where fragrances are rare, and if they are worn they’re blue). This has become one of my absolute favourites since I bought a 100ml (at a great price on notino btw). It just works on my skin, and it is my second most complimented fragrance.

The scent: 10/10 If there is Oud it’s only there in the initial 2 minutes, which has a resinous medicinal quality. But yeah, this is not an Oud fragrance, the emphasis is on ‘wood’. And it’s beautifully blended as there’s no one wood that stands out, but I get a very creamy almost sandalwood/cedar vibe. It also has an almost vanilla creaminess to it. It’s unique, and is definitely best on skin. On paper it’s plasticky and harsh, on skin it’s like your swimming in an imaginary hot dessert made of wood that for some reason is delicious.

The longevity: 8/10 I initially got disappointed with the longevity as I thought it only lasted 2 hours. If you spray on your neck then I find you go nose blind very quickly. I sprayed it on my wrist and could still smell it 6 hours later, and once I got a compliment 8 hours in. So, perhaps a bit like Aventus (which it smells nothing like to clarify) the noseblindness that is caused by the intensity of aroma-chemicals used masks it’s true longevity to the wearer.

This is better in heat in my opinion, it becomes really woody and creamy. On colder days I like it less as it seems sweeter in a resinous way, which isn’t bad but not as good.

Overall 9.5/10 a modern classic. Not to mention most non-fragheads will never have smelled this, especially if like me you are in your early twenties so it will turn heads."

I would love to smell like this for the rest of my life. It starts fresh and then gets woody and sweet. It is so versitale, easy to wear at any time of the year even summer, but not when is really hot outside. It's versitale and easy to wear but in a unique way, not that blue style that is everywhere. It is suited in a dressier occasion, but you can wear it casual too. An elegant, masculine but not dated scent.

My biggest complains are the perfomance and the projection. I've never try it before the reformulation but in my skin projects for a little more than an hour and stays very close to the skin scent for about 6 hours. After 4-5 hours you can hardly detect it on your skin. It is very disapointing pefomance for such an expensive parfum.

10/10 for the scent
6/10 for the perfomance
5/10 for the projection

I wouldn't recomment it because of the bad perfomance and the high price! Please fix the perfomance!"

I always looking for new look to oud note in perfumes and Oud Wood is one the first perfumes that took oud to another level.
Instead of animalic and sweet face of oud, there new spicy woody aspect in this one and for this, it is one the easiest oud perfume to wear. It is not heavy or cloying but as much as you want is exotic and sexy.
Tom Ford already proved himself with involving to creation of magnificent M7 but this one is something else. This is a perfect and balance blend of woods and spices.
Opening of this perfume has a little medical vibe because of oud and other woods. But after 5 minutes Smokey and woodsy notes arrive and mix with spices. Cardamom, vanilla and pepper are so bold in spicy notes and these spices match with woody note so perfectly. Cardamom is the one I really like in this perfume and give it very pleasant touch. And in the end creamy sandalwood comes to play to make this combo a perfect ending.
I take my hat off to Mr. Tom Ford just because of this masterpiece.


سیزده سال از لانچ این عطر بینظیر میگذره و هنوزم به نظرم یکی از بهترین عطر ها عودی ای هست که میشه به راحتی توی این باز که پر از عطر های عودی جور با جوره انتخاب کرد.
چیزی که من توی این عطر دوست دارم اینه که توی اون موقع یه نگاه متفاوت به عود کرد و با پایین آوردن جنبه خای انیمالیک و شیرین عود یه ترکیب جدید که به راحتی میشه پوشیدش ایجاد کرد.
یه ترکیب فوق العاده از چوب و ادویه که میتونه نظر هر کسی رو به خودش جلب کنه.
آقای تام فورد قبلا هم خودش رو با شرکت داشتن در تیم طراحی عطر ام 7 افسانه ای ثابت کرده بود و اینجا با به وجود آوردن این ترکیب بینظیر نشون داد که میتونه خلاقیتش رو به مرحله بعدی ببره.
شروع این عطر یکم تند و دارویی بخاطر عود اما خیلی زود این بو دارویی مانند فرو میکشه و بوی دودی و چوبی فوق العاده ی عود در کنار نت های اسپایسی مثل هل، وانیل و فلفل خود نمایی میکنه. وجود این ادویه ها به خصوص هل این کار رو خیلی دلنشین و جذاب میکنه.
در آخر هم جوب صندل با اون حالت خامه ای مانندش به عطر اضافه نیشه تا یه ترکیب بی نقص رو به جا بزاره.
اون کسایی که دنبال یه عطر شیک، لوکس و همه پسند از عود هستن این چیزیه که میتونه راضیشون کنه.
ماندگاری و پخش بوی مناسبی داره.
قیمت فقط مشکل اصلی این عطره یکم سخت پیدا میشه."

Quite how Notino are selling a 50ml bottle for £130 and 2ml samples for £3.83 is messing with my mind though.

Are the samples genuine?

And if so, is the bottle worth the difference?"
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","This is nowhere dark and thick as I remember it being when I first gave it a sniff years ago. I'm certainly not trying to say that it got watered down in the meanwhile, even though I would now describe it as a watery oud, pardon me. It gets a bit watery or airy on male skin, and I think it can be even a bit sickening. Or at least it doesn't meet my expectations from an oud dominant fragrance - I prefer them thicker, chocolaty or at least powdery. I suppose that in the meanwhile I got used to the scent of oud and got familiar with its many iterations and interpretations.
On female skin, this gets musky. It actually very much reminded me of White Suede - another TF fragrance I admire very much and would certainly love to have and enjoy it. I thought at first that a very good girl-friend of mine, who wears it regularly, actually wore WS - she smelled so feminine and sensual. I was very much surprised to find out it was Oud Wood on her. Obviously those two TFs have much more in common than it appears.
I suppose that this is a safe oud. Something that wouldn't go unnoticed on the western hemisphere, but will not be bothersome either.
Curiously, though, I've never imagined a woman actually wearing it even though it's marketed unisex, but now that I know one who sports it, I can say I much prefer it that way. It develops a certain dept and warmth, whereas it remains kind of thin and cool on a male-friend of mine."

In terms of performance it's almost like others on this site have a different fragrance. Mine bought at Frankfurt Duty Free at the start of February 2020. (Batch code: AA9 19310)

About 30min of very moderate projection - maybe arm's length then skin for 1 - 2 hours. Gone after 3 hours.. Last longer on clothes.

I've a 5ml travel atomizer that I use to reapply halfway thru the day or if I feel the need for a boost.

My Versace Oud Noir smells roughly the same to me and double the longevity (and a fraction of the price). The TF is richer and deeper and that why I stay with it but a real shame about the productivity."

It doesn't last as long as its counterparts in the same brand and it doesn't scream ""Here I am!"" either. It's perfect for any day, anywhere, and any situation. I'd recommend making sure that when you spray this once, catch half of the spray on your lower neck and the other half around your collar area on your clothes so it lasts much longer during the day. Since it isn't that pungent in the first place, a second spray wouldn't hurt."

Starts off very sharp and even disgusting to me, with the weird notes of like a burned rubber + strong alcoholic blast(not a boozy note you would find in some other frags) + some spices. After like half a hour the rubbery smell calms down and theres some synthetic sweetness note(raspberry?) and woody notes(no oud detected) start to come out. After like 1-1.5 becomes a skin and a more enjoyable scent with vanilla, amber and some spices creating a typical warm-spicy aroma you would literally find in hundreds of designer frags. No sillage and no projection whatsoever. After 3-4 hours its completely gone. And the most pathetic part of it is that it costs 200+ bucks for 100ml. Is it a joke? Or was it just badly reformulated? Either way, there is no reason in the world to buy this for its price, do yourself a favor and get some Amouage or Xerjoff instead."

Look elsewhere if anyone wishes to smell an exceptionally blended oud(thinking of Ajmal's Khallab and Plum Japonais here). Oud is a sensual note which can be manipulated in a million ways, and this scent fails exactly at that.

Oud here only gives a kinda-sharp opening and adds another woody facet to the other exotic woods present in this fragrance. This fragrance is for those who hate oud.
For a comparison, Guerlain's Santal Royal is a better oud but TF Oud Wood is a lot better scent overall.

Dry down of this fragrance has creamy sandalwood with some amber. Mass pleasing woody office scent. Signature worthy for a CEO who can afford the private blend."

But no worries, I'm reposting it here, so that everyone can enjoy:

Retried this one today. Interesting... an ""oud fragrance"" without oud. It won't be the first time it happens, but at $250/300 a pop, that's simply unacceptable. It's all about saffron and creamy rosewood, supported by vanilla, pepper and an camphorous aromachemical supposed to give an impression of oud in the opening (similar to the one used in other low-tier designer frags), the ends up giving an herbal/minty/medicinal impression very far from the real deal. Should have been named ""Camphor Wood"".

The opening is a fuller bodied version of Versace Oud Noir (shockingly similar) while the drydown shares similarities with Dunhill Icon Absolute. Even better: Montale Dark Aoud, which uses a woody aromachemical more true to oud - what TF Oud Wood dreams to be.
It's nice taken on its own, even if very linear and with disappointing performance. (the need to overspray is unacceptable at that price point).
Just to give an idea, 10 sprays of Oud Wood on one arm, 1 spray of Dark Aoud on the other: I can only smell the Montale, and have to stick my nose on the skin for the Tom Ford...

It may have been unique when it was originally issued (due to the use of Givaudan's aromachemical that was new at the time, with exclusivity of use by TF), but now that the Versace is available for ~6X less, and the Montale for 4-5X less, there's no valid reason to spend such amounts of money on this one.
Will do the job of being a nice and discreet woody office frag for colder days for early career professionals, but that's pretty much it."
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","Woody oud, very clean, very soft, very fine and sophisticated. Copied with great perfection by Versace Oud Noir, but here the aroma has a little more naturalness, although Versace has some extra notes of interest that I didn't feel here, like leather and spices. Incredible right? A designer frag has more layers than a niche. However, the proposal here seems to me to have been so intentional: oud woody, pure 100% linear and without extra sensitive notes to disturb the experience. However, the aromatic metaphor is the same for my nose in both: pharmacy cotton."

One thing I have realized is the atomizer is very weak. Similar to a JPG type sprayer... Nothing like a Dior or Chanel type.

Therefore generous spraying is required in order to give it some oomph.

This is one of those that is priced too high but the scent factor comes through to justify a purchase. IMO.

Also, you can consider getting the many byproducts like deodorant, oil, body spray, to help longevity."

That's why you see users vote oud being the most prominent note in Oud Wood or Gold Prestigium.

The word 'refined' is over-used and honestly just an excuse to give the consumers a toned down version of something. That being said, I don't even get any ""refined oud"" in this one. You can get ""refined oud"" in M7.

This starts off with a pleasant floral-woody note and dries down to a tonka-vanilla combo. The cardamom gives a nice semi-sweetness to the fragrance.

Overall, a nice smelling fragrance. Very safe for most situations, easily a dumb reach. But the deceptive marketing and ridiculously high price point is unjustified IMHO."

Fragrance appreciators and collectors read it or hear it in the name and some kind of bell goes off, ""Oud, oh my god! Rich, skanky, smoked, rubbery, burnt wood opulence!"". Which is I think a correct response, but however, interpretations and utilisation of oud can and should differ in my opinion. M7 has taught us so much (that is just one fragrance example). With that being said Tom Ford Oud Wood is a great innovation and interpretation of an oud fragrance.

Right from the opening the oud and rosewood are present, but ever so mildly, and I like that, restraint yes it is good, dare I say artistic from time to time. The aura of pepper around the rosewood and oud is beautifully executed here. Then this bourbon, (It is in my cocktail rotation lately) sweet sandalwood rolls in with this richness, and all this is done with a whisper. Oud Wood is not a bombastic fragrance, and I don't want it to be either. Finally, in the mid we get the amber, tonka and vetiver, with just a kiss of vanilla. And that is all you get and that is all you need!

Tom Ford Oud wood is a skin scent but as mentioned before that is what you want it to be. Case in point I received this as a Christmas gift from my wife, because this is what she wants to smell on me when we are close. Can't argue with that. Oud Wood for me is a scent for someone in their late 20's and up. This can be worn in or out of the office, hell even date night this works. In my opinion this veers more masculine. You can dress up or dress down with Oud Wood, which is a true testament to it's versatility.

I wore this fragrance so many times to figure out how I felt about it and how I could use it. It all clicked when my wife said, ""Spray that one. That is what I want to smell on you today."". Problem solved. Give Tom Ford Oud Wood a few sprays when you want something dynamic and inviting!"

Notes:
For me this one is all about Coumarin and Brazilian Rosewood, and a slight hint of Cardamom in the opening. And I get some very close to skin sandalwood smoothness in the dry down. I can't smell ANY oud at all in this one.. so the name is a bit confusing to me...!

Projection is weak which makes this a shy, day to day wearable beauty. On my skin it lasts 8-10 hours with the first 1-2 containing hints of projection.

Smooth, Clean, Safe (but unique). Both gentlemen and hipster friendly.

Caution: If i use this one to many days in a row i can't smell it anymore.

Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","I love Tom Ford's fragrances and have a few of them. I'm a woman but find that more masculine scents tend to smell better on me. Saying that, I found this way too masculine. As a middle eastern woman, I wear a lot of different ouds, but I didn't get ANY oud smell from this one, so quite disappointed. To me it just smells quite chemical, and a bit like a strong cheap men's shower gel. Not a fan, and it didn't last very long. It's a no from me."
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']",I recently bought OUD WOOD after all the hype and because i'm a fragrance lover.I was disapointed not by the scent itself but by the performance.It smell great but don't project and don't last at all.It really don't worth the pricetage.I was satisfied with TUSCAN LEATHER and TOBACCO VANILLE so mr ford i forgive you for this one.
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","I have recently purchased another bottle of Oud Wood as it is one of my favourite fragrances but it seems much softer than the bottle I previously owned. Don’t get me wrong I do get wafts of this here and there throughout the day, but my new bottle doesn’t seem to have the strength or sillage that my old bottle had. The older bottle was 3 sprays and I could smell it strongly all day long and well into the night. Not with my new bottle which is disappointing considering the price."
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","Originally bought an A82 gold label in Milano (2012). It lasts for an entire day (12h+), moderate sillage, very oftenly complimented. It's very true to the initial smell throughout the drydown, nice mix of sandalwood, rosewood and oud with vanilla.
Old one was running low, bought a new one last week. Was an A89 grey label (2019). Lasts a while shorter, about 6-8h before only becoming noticeable when nose to skin. Sillage is VERY soft on this one. Starts out very sharp and unpleasant, not sure if overly alcoholic or something else. Dries down to almost pure sandalwood with a trace of vanilla. There's no oud or rosewood present.
If you can get a gold label, maybe even batch A82, this is an amazing sweet oud and present perfume incomparable to any other oud.
The grey label (or at least A89) is not worth getting imo, it just smells like a generic cheap woody perfume without oud with an OK longevity."
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","I received a 2ml sample of this today and I like it. It reminds me of Bleu de Chanel Parfum (not EDT) though on the dry down. I only sprayed it once. I'm going to give it another go tonight and see what I smell. The opening is great though, just enough oud, I love it, but for me the oud disappears later on in this frag.

Note I haven't smelled Bleu de Chanel EDP since I sold my 100ml bottle last year. My nose may have changed a bit since then."
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","This is probably in my top 10 elegant fragrances that I've smelled. You can put this on any man with a suit and his vibe will change instantly (for the better, of course).

It is advertised as unisex, but I definitely don't feel like a woman (by my standards, of course) could pull this off. It evokes a peaceful, sorted out man, who doesn't want to stand out from the crowd, but does so naturally.

It is one of those perfumes that made me realize some time ago the amazing power of smell. You definitely feel like you're about to accomplish big things when wearing this. Seems to make you more successful in pretty much every aspect when you have it.

Now talking about the scent itself (sorry for getting so passionate) I barely get an oud touch. I get a coffee, sweet smell, tobacco and heavy smell, instantly recognizable. People are saying its sillage is moderate, but I believe it does fill the area are you're in, maybe not a room, but definitely more than 6 feet. No need to get more than 3 sprays on skin, and maybe one on clothes.

A must have, imho. Your 30 ml bottle (for around 110 US dollars) will last you a REALLY long time.

9.75/10."
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","TOM FORD as always making unique fragrances out there. OUD WOOD is very well blended oud perfume, it is a perfume that makes you feel you are in a suit even if you are wearing trainers. It is also very unique, in a world full of blues, sauvage and invictus smelling unique is a very nice feeling. It is a very long lasting perfume and projects very well for 6+ hours. It is also a very gentleman perfume, women can wear it too but not their type imho. I have just recently bought this bottle and is growing more on me each time i wear it. It is also very versatile, the best time to wear is winter days. fall and spring for me."
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","Interesting. After 45 min you have to bury your nose into your arm to get a whiff. Not worth the money. The bottle is cheap, light and plastic feeling. Look else where for your thrill, and also for a scent to just contemplate to because this one is for neither."

I have some oud chips from Cambodia that I burn on a mica plate that smells very similar to oud wood."
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","Beautiful! Gentle, classy and refined! Great sillage and longevity. Moderate projection."

Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","Oud Wood is a perfect work scent, and would be a great choice for a signature scent (if you have the money).

I’ve been delving into niche and luxury designer scents recently, so naturally I had to buy a decant of Oud Wood. The first spray I applied to my wrist, and I was met with the smell of chlorine/Clorox that a couple reviewers mentioned. Beneath that smell was a pleasant transparent wood. Also I now understand the meaning of what some reviewers describe as a watery note. I initially had mixed feelings because I loved the woody note and watery transparent character, but was off put by the Clorox smell. After an hour the chlorine note toned down, and deeper in the dry down the amber and vanilla became noticeable. This added a subtle sweetness to the fragrance. And after a couple hours I really liked it.

The second wearing I applied two sprays to my neck. What a difference the location made. The chlorine note was now more of a fresh clean metallic note...much more pleasant. Smelling it up close on my first wearing was the problem, whereas smelling the sillage projecting from my neck was an altogether different experience. I’m not sure if the chlorine note is the oud, but whatever it is,I think this is what adds its watery clean vibe.

The sillage is beautiful, sophisticated, and unique. It doesn’t fill a room, but it projects enough to be noticed. It’s light and transparent, rather than being heavy and dense. That makes it a great choice for work. I normally reapply at lunch with my fragrances, so if a scent can project a couple feet for 5 hours I’m happy. Oud Wood accomplishes this; it lasts 12 hours on my skin and consistently projects about 1-2 feet for over 6 hours. I don’t know if this contains and Iso-E Super, but it behaves like Iso-E does. After wearing it for 10 hrs I thought it was only a skin scent, then I moved my arm and could detect the sillage from my wrist that was two feet away.

Oud Wood is a perfect choice for the office because it is unique, non-offensive, transparent, long lasting, sophisticated, and could be worn year round. It’s probably the next fragrance I’m going to buy. I give it a 9/10...but the more I wear it the more I love it so it may become a 10/10."
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']",I have the old version (yellow). On my skin the long lasting is 12hours+ and the projection is 5-6 hours.For me this is very good fragrance!
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","I love this! If you have a problem with longevity, 2 sprays at the same spot.

I can smell it 16 hours later! This do not have bad longevity.. maybe the old batches was crazy good, i dont know?! But this will last you all day in the fall and winter.. 9/10"
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","Tom Ford's Oud Wood is a pleasant, warm, synthetic sandalwood and cardamom fragrance but I do not really consider it ""oud"". I recognise the same ""oud"" that Tom brought over to the West with M7 by Yves Saint Laurent but there is not much more oud in Oud Wood than there was in M7.

I find this an enjoyable scent to wear (which is rare with the expensive Tom Ford releases) and once upon a time thought this was very special and I would have it as my signature scent. I have since discovered there are much better ""oud"" frags, better wood frags and better Tom Ford frags (Beau de Jour).

Oud Wood is a good starter niche but I think I am now wanting ""better"" and more natural scents and ingredients."
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","I really enjoy this one. It's a clean/fresh oud and it's effin sexy. I have tried the gold label version as well - that one starts out with a very medicinal aroma but as it settles it becomes very deep, warm and sweet. I love spraying it onto my jumpers in the winter and getting wafts throughout the day. So comforting."
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","I've done a complete reversal on this. I REALLY hated my sample as I was getting a rotten celery vibe from it. Last week, I was walking through a department store and it was out on display so I thought: ""What the hell, why not?"". Wow.....what a difference a FULL spray makes. I came to realize that, in order to appreciate it, a small and limited sample wasn't enough. I immediately swapped someone my ADP Colonia Oud for a 100 ml bottle of this and I couldn't be more pleased. A very masculine soft oud that makes you smell like a million bucks. Love it!"
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","How sad that they reformulated this scent into a watered down nothing version of the original. The original fragrance had a sharp clarity to it, an alien symmetry, of oud and patchouly. The later batches are mostly patchouli. I propose a toast for Tom Ford's Oud Wood, may it rest in peace happily unaware that later generations discredit its name :'("

It’s the quintessential fall fragrance. Only a hint of oud here but that’s all that’s required for the desired effect. It oozes class but remains alluring. It’s sophisticated but not austere. Just enough sweetness to remain playful while maintaining a charming woody/spicy vibe.

To sum it up in a word: debonair."
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","This fragrance is not for everybody. That being said, I fell head over heels in love with this beautiful unisex perfume when I sampled it. Since that sample I have purchased 3 more bottles. Upon first whiff, It definitely smells of a woodpile. But it's the dry down that makes it my personal favorite. Rich, sweet and warm undertones start to waft up after wearing it for about 2 hours. For me, it stays that way another 6-8 hours, then just gently fades.My experience as far as projection of the fragrance depends on how much you put on at once.Yes, it is pricey. But in my experience as a fragrance afficinado you just know when you find your signature scent. I wear this year round, and occasionally layer it with Yves Rocher Vanilla noir. When I layer the fragrances, I am always getting asked what I am wearing and told how wonderful it smells. Keep in mind personal chemistry and try to sample first. IMHO it's decadent,sexy,and addictive."
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","I have this parfum. The smokiness from the agar and sandalwood is just lovely. It just reminds me of the 80's when my dad had put on kouros, smoked his cigars and left the room. This one stays 10 hours easily on me. The sillage to me is close to my skin which is perfect. One spray on the front of my shirt around the chest area and i can smell this every time I take a breath. Just wonderful. Certain perfumes are meant to please you, the people around you and the ones you walk past. Other parfumes are meant for only your pleasure. Tom ford oud wood is for my own pleasure. If I want to be loud I use Amouage Interlude for men. The price is a bit on the high side here in the netherlands but in my opinion it is worth every euro."
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","It's not that interesting in that it's not something you can pick up nuances in.

Performance wise, 1 spray to the back of the neck (2019 bottle) and I catch whiffs of it still 10 hours later. I wouldn't want to wear more than one spray of it or it. Tried 2 sprays and it was too much and would be loud and would lose all its class because of it.

Performance is fantastic.

A good scent, nothing magical, far too two dimensional to be intriguing, but the quality certainly shines through for sure.

At time of writing, above it is rated at 4.45/5. I would say that's a bit generous as its propped up by its great performance really."
Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","As a female I prefer Unisex fragrances and use Mugler Over The Musk (My Favorite Fragrance by far), Clean Sueded Oud, Victor & Rolf Spicebomb, Replica By The Fireplace and Atelier Silver Iris. I thought I would love this, but this is VERY strong and MUCH more masculine than the other unisex fragrances I love.

It does smell expensive (nothing artificial here), but it also makes my eyes water and I feel like I need a shower. After wearing Oud Wood for two hours I still am smelling it more than I would like. I think it will be wonderful as a body spray with one shot at a lower level. I don’t want to get it anywhere near my face ever again. It is great that it lasts so long since the price is high and one shot is all you need, so the bottle will last forever. I give it four stars for the silage and nice smell, but still perhaps better a fragrance for a man."

Oud Wood Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['woody', 'oud', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'balsamic', 'fresh spicy', 'amber', 'powdery', 'sweet']","Very smooth and pleasant, almost but not quite seductive scent.

Very well blended and smooth, has a slight hint of oud, yet mostly is a soft, sexy scent that most people would enjoy smelling, while they would run away from a sample of barnyard, fecal oud oil from Arabia.

Could almost drop the word ""oud"" and just call it ""Tom Ford Wood"".

Only problem is poor longevity and projection.

Scent itself is ultra smooth and nice.

Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","NOT your typical gourmand; to me, this is a warm spicy (leaning towards masculine) scent.

It's definitely a fall/winter scent, meaning heavy. I get a lots of dry warm spices like clove, nutmeg, cinnamon or maybe it's the tonka beans. Reminds me of mulled wine but with a cherry base, heavy on the spices.

I'm expecting something more delicious... but this is not."
Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']",5.5/10. Amaretto liquor and baby talcum powder. Makes me cough. I was tempted to wash it off but once the powder dies down it improves to heliotrope sweet cakes. That first stage is quite rough and not for the sensitive sniffer.
Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","One of my favorite fragrances to wear. Dark enchanted forest fairytale vibes. Mysterious, dense, sugary sweet my friend considers this too masculine and I cannot even make an attempt at understanding how she got that impression. To my nose there is nothing masculine about this fragrance although it can absolutely be worn by a man. Feve smells like it could have been from the house of Lolita Lempicka (before they began watering their fragrances). This is absolutely perfect for an enchantress like myself who performs magic spells beneath the light of a full moon. Absolutely incomparable and one of the most magical and addictive fragrances I’ve smelled in quite some time. My goodness this is amazing through and through. When casting spells this is what I reach for."

This fragrance is the reason why! Roasted Tonka Beans, Cherry, Lavender, I Mean come on man! This is French perfumery at its best!

Then the Blue Goblin came to our lives! But thats another story!

The reason i Respect Dior so much is because he pushed the boundaries of the Designer game man!

Beast 12H Plus! Even on my ""Bad 2018 Version"" That is!

Masterpiece 10/10!

Oh and before i forget! DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF THE GAME DIOR!"

I don't hate sweet perfume at all, but the initial blast from this is aggressively sweet. The the spice is not the type of warm spice I normally want - its like sniffing a packet of dry spices. Overall, its too harsh for me. I prefer Tobaccolor and Spice Blend in the same vein from MCD."

Blissfully calm, like the morning when you don't have to rush anywhere. Warm, like a favorite blanket with funny reindeer. Soft as a curled-up cat. Sweet as the aroma of hot chocolate from the open door of a small cafe. Dark and deep, like an autumn park: dusky lavender, leather-vanilla: a forgotten glove on a leafy bench. The alchemy of autumn, turning gold into copper..."
Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","Gourmand unisex.
Gourmand with a hint of sourness (the citrus) and floral (lavender+ fresia) that will develop in a sweet creamy and powdery skin scent.

It is unique and definitely a masterpiece. 4.5/5"
Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","Perhaps foolishly, when I started my fragrance journey, I was determined to try every cherry note out there. Deep dark cherries were one of my mother's favourite things to eat growing up and I get a little teary eyed smelling them, thinking about bowls of cherries shared over the kitchen table with her in my youth.

FD...firstly, this is what I wished Guerlain LPRN would be, but isn't. I immediately get cherries and am brought back to the kitchen table with my mom. There is a warmth to this fragrance, a sweetness, brought by the cherries, and the ever so slightly powderiness of the lavender and tonka bean. It is very smooth, very well blended and brings me back to my childhood somehow.

I don't like fruity and powder at all but the way this is composed, I don't notice any one note being harsh or sticking out.

Longevity is wonderful, 6-7 hours on skin, silage is strong - you can go gentle on the trigger.

Overall 7/10, personally, but 9.5/10 overall. This is not one that feels like me when I wear it personally but holy crap, does this do something to me. One of the most beautifully blended fragrances out there."

Keep in mind I have 2016 bottle and I never smelled the newer 2018 reformulated version which people say that it’s different. First when regular no -fragrance interested people smell this they are amazed with its quality and they keep telling me it’s a 10/10 when I ask for a grade, plus they ask me where they can buy it. This is an amalgamation of gourmand, classy, sexy sort of scent. I’m gonna cherish that 2016 bottle for a long time since newer ones don’t have a good reputation. Love this."

The other notes are there but they are really toned down and you have to look for them to notice.

This has a really synthetic vibe and that is really off putting for me.

It is cozy and nice for the cold weather but nothing special. Definitely not worth the hype and the price tag for me.
I only have a sample and I would not buy this for its price.

That said I do not think it is bad . It is just ok."

I kept smelling something spicy like cinnamon on my skin(weird, I know). 30 mins It was too sweet. More almond/cherry than vanilla.Very powdery and floral by my nose. I was thinking a little too mature for me and hey- I'm in my 40s so there's that. I was glad I just had a decant.

Two hours later, I am totally digging this. It's turned into an elegant gourmand. Wow. Cozy, warm, gently sweet vanilla. If you like a gourmand that's not so ""in your face"" this is it. Not much for projection. More projection than AV Orchidee Vanilla but less than CD Hypnotic poison.

I am totally down with this! Amazed at how this unfolded and looking forward to what's to come."

I am writing this right after trying it for the first time. Now this is how you should do a gourmand.. very skillful handling of praline, cacao and caramel with LAVENDER , CEDAR and of course very prominent tonka, vanilla and cherry notes... I am speechless!

It’s not like other oftenly poor made overpriced niche gourmands, the ones smell like you mixed every note in your hand and came with a weird synthetic-sweet mash overload with some notes trying to peak up but always subdued by the caos of the fragrance.

Feve Delicieuse is so well blended but you can appreciate every single note on it‘s own. The leather note becomes relatively more recognizable as it dries down, despite this being rather a linear fragrance. BUT even though the “sum” of the scent is linear overall, the notes behave like they are dancing under the roof of the ballroom of this fragrance! When I smell my arm continously, 1 second praline shows up and then leather, then tonka and the vanilla come onto stage carrying the cherry on top of them, then praline again gets front of them hand to hand with cacao and the show goes on with cedar and lavender being the back up dancers. OUT OF THE WORLD QUALITY!
The only downside is the projection is on the lower side but I am too hooked on watching the show even if it’s not a loud one."

It seems more masculine than feminine to me. There is a warm and thick familiar powdery scent lingering in the background, similar to baby powder. Tonka, cacao, caramel, yes, they are all there. It’s been two hours, and as I’m searching for each individual note, it hits me- this smells identical to A&D ointment. For those of you with no children, A&D ointment is used as a preventive for diaper rash. NOT SEXY!
Is my extremely sensitive nose not working correctly today, I wonder? I will wait a few more hours to see if the notes evolve from A&D into the masterpiece this is hyped up to be. And, I'll get some evaluations from my lovely, trendy teenage daughters.

It’s been four more hours. The fragrance has not evolved past A&D ointment. I am disappointed. My daughters summaries: Daughter #1 (22yo): Smells like baby wipes; Daughter #2 (21yo): Just like kids cold medicine, Daughter #3 (17yo): Smells like Avon Skin so Soft that we used to repel mosquitoes as kids.

This fragrance, although odd IMO, does perform great, longevity and projection are both top notch. But, I don’t want to smell like diaper ointment, so I’m taking a pass. I will return this bottle.

Rating: 1/10. It's not overtly offensive; its just not sexy or appealing in any stretch of the imagination.
Compliments: 0/10.
Projection: 8/10; Sillage: 8/10; Application: 4 atomizations. Performance: 9/10
Ages: None. I don’t know anyone, at any age, who wants to intentionally smell like diaper ointment, so I’m leaving this blank.
Blind-Buy: No, definitely get a decant and sample this first. And, get some honest and candid opinions from someone you trust before you spend $250 on a bottle of this."

I expected something more vanilla, earthy and smooth, however, this is a bit more loud than I expected.
At first whiff: Baby powder - not iris type of powder vibe but actual powder, Spicy - Cinnamon isn't in the notes but I get that spicy tingle in my nose perhaps from the mint, Cherry - which I actually do not find a pleasant note in any perfume so I'm perplexed why I thought I would love this, Then there is something somewhere in the middle of the sour tart cherry, light talc and spice is a comforting, smooth, familiar and warm touch. Maybe it's the tonka/vanilla/milk.
I do like it more after it chills tf out. The chocolate, caramel and praline smooth out the spicy a bit.

Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","Dior Feve Delicieuse EDP opens with a strong projection of sweet, lactonic, gourmand, and fruity notes. The opening is delicious, refined, bold, inviting, and delightful. The milk, praline, caramel, cacao, sour cherry, and vanilla are the opening most noticeable notes. The chocolate, milk, praline, caramel, and vanilla mix their notes into a lactonic, dessert-like, and delectable accord, intense and delicious. The sour cherry is also noticeable, a candy-sweet, tart, syrupy, with an almond touch fruit. As the fragrance commences to dry down, the tonka bean develops a sweet, spicy, caramel, and nutty accord closely follow by the ambery and the sweet resinous touch of the benzoin and, the creamy milky, and warm touch of the sandalwood. The leather is the projecting accord, a mild inoffensive leathery touch in the background. The jasmine, freesia, and lavender are support notes, a faint touch in towards the back of the fragrance. The fragrance is relatively linear, the bergamot is a faint touch during the opening, regardless, all featured notes come up as soon as the fragrance is applied and continue into the dry down which occurs very quickly. Once Dior Feve Delicieuse EDP has reached its full dry down, it can be summarized as a strong projection, fantastic, sweet, vanilla, cacao, caramel, praline, cherry, milk, and resinous fragrance with leathery, and faint floral accords. The fragrance feels ambery, appetizing, bold, casual, comforting, creamy, delectable, delicious, dense, dry, elegant, energizing, exotic, expensive, fruity, gourmand, high-quality, inviting, slightly leathery, long-lasting, milky, modern, natural, nicely-blended, nutty, resinous, rare, rich, romantic, seductive, special, sweet, syrupy, unique, unisex, warm, and very pleasant.

After years and years of using other Dior scents, I was expecting for this so called prive collection to be the best, reason why I really wanted to buy and try one of these. I need to start with the longevivity... oh, god, this is the weakest perfume I ever tried from Dior. After 3 hours I can barely smell it on my skin.
Also, I don't really smell the top notes at all. Only a bit of cherry and then tonka and vanilla with a small hint of cedar. As others said, this is not gourmand at all. It dries out into a very powdery scent. For me is 3/10."

This is a total comfort scent to me. It reminds me of the comfort and mystery of the pocketbook, where from the depths would ocassionally emerge a cherry lifesaver candy or aged mint and a tissue, just when absolutely needed. The cherry and mint of the candies, the powderyness of a Guerlain face powder and an waxy-scented lipstick in a metal tube, as well as some of the dust of an aging packet of tissues all being cradled in the depths of the high quality and somehwat aged soft leather of the pocketbook, bring back comforting feelings of when mother had it all under control and knew exactly how we should behave. Mother carried only the best leather bags, and the leather is very high quality here, so it smells like the softest leather ever. The cherry is strong on me at first, but eventually blends well with the powderiness that eventually settles in. This is one of the most memory-evoking fragrances I have ever smelled. I'm thinking of many Sundays, mother dressed in her finest with lipstick on and face powdered, carrying her leather bag and gloves, but I'm falling asleep in the old Gothic-style church with my head eventually settling next to the handbag, nodding off while watching dust particles sparkle in the streams of light through the arched stained glass windows, hearing the faint crinkling from the woman in the pew behind opening a mint..."

Obviously he likes sweet fragrances because he wears Feve Delecieuse. My problem with it is that there are so many distinct accords happening at the same time, all at such intensity, and it smells as though the wearer is trying very hard to be noticed. It's powdery, sweet, balsamic, woody, spicy, fruity, leather, floral, everything but the kitchen sink, and the sum of its parts are greater than the whole.

Bougie cocoa-flavored play doh.

After a few minutes I get mint, tonka, and cherry.

This isn't a powdery play doh in the vein of Dior's Hypnotic Poison EDT, but a spicy, minty play doh. Gourmand but refreshing.

The dry down reminds me of ""Chocolovers"" by Aquolina even though there is no orange note here. Isn't it funny how you can remember a fragrance you haven't smelled since 12+ years ago?

The leading note of the composition is tonka bean. It is known to connoisseurs of perfume for its sweet, almond-like aroma.

The almond tones of tonka are enriched here with heaps of dry cocoa with a clear boost of something floral and dusty.

Then this cocoa tempest quiets down and reveals a flickering, potent tonka bean. In the great sea of this ingredient there are other notes sunken: tobacco and cinnamon. Cocoa takes on a more chocolate form while caramel starts shimmering somewhere and vanilla takes the scene. From now on, smooth vanilla penetrates every single note of the blend."

I think it might turn into a love. The initial spray and first few mins are so not my favourite. I cannot describe the opening, but it is strange, ""off"" and very chemical like.

Luckily, the not so great opening softens and the tonka, vanilla and soft woods come out. My skin is really picking up a sweet tobacco note and dry cherry too.

On my skin this is like a very posh combo of Versace The Dreamer, TF Tobacco Vanille and a soft boozy scotch note. Overall, I would say this is an excellent Blind Buy (so far) :)"
Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","Warm and cozy but very sweet opening with minute traces of a slightly herbal lavender. It quickly goes to the heart and what I get is a nice mix of cherry, florals, and tonka bean. The mid is very cherry liqueur like, and I'm glad it's kept in check by the supporting notes. I can detect some white florals as well. The liqueur accord gives the whole composition a slightly boozy quality which does smell nice on the skin. I have to mention that the whole structure is obviously very gourmand in nature so for anyone who detests sweet/gourmand notes, this one is not for you. As time goes on, it gets a bit more powdery and then the vanillic aspect comes into play as well. It doesn't smell like straight up vanilla either, but Demachy has once again blended this very well which means it transitions smoohtly from top, heart, to base notes. The drydown is still powdery sweet with a nice lingering tonka/vanilla accord. I really enjoy sweet fragrances and this is as sweet as I'd get. Luckily the blend here is exquisite and dare I say fairly elegant.

Performance is great, will last for quite some time with decent projection. More of a cold weather scent but could work in spring or cold summer nights as well. Suitable for casual, romantic settings, or office wear if you watch your application. Unisex, leaning slightly feminine, but a man who appreciates gourmand scents should pull this off without issue.

I was a little shocked at the smell of the initial opening because it didn't smell gourmand - I was wondering what the heck people were talking about. It shortly dries down though to powder, tonka, with a little bit of vanilla which is gorgeous. Definitely unisex. Quite soft, no big projection here. Very comfortaing. If I didn't know any better I would have guessed this was a Guerlain fragrance, as the tonka reminds me of Mon Guerlain and there is some leathery vanilla that reminds me of Shalimar.

This smells expensive and is divine. If you love gourmand scents then trust me on this one. The bottle is beautiful too. I understand the Christmas vibe that some people get from this - there is some cinnamon or clove in there too. I guess this scent would really come into its own during Autumn and Winter, but I love it so much I will wear it all year round.

Now that my tastes are a bit more refined, I have tried it again, and determined that it is much too powdery for me. I am surprised by the accords listed here.. it is not very sweet in my opinion. much more powdery than sweet.

Then again! I’m just now realizing that I tried this when the weather was cooler.. Maybe I’ll set this aside until fall.

I don’t love it that much! It’s sweet without any edge or nuances. Actually I was shocked by Hypnotic Poison too- just root beer and playdough. Anyway I will update as I sample it more.

Update: It is confirmed. This one I do not need in my collection, yay. Because it is expensive. And yesterday I just sprang for one of the last EDP bottles of Roja Enigma, which was an instant obsession for me. Eff the “pour homme” on the bottle- c’est pour femme! Pour moi!"

This is so not me. Where to begin? This is a powder bomb and supposedly it has a lot of gourmand notes. I can definitely get the cocoa powder. It smells like it’s made out of it in fact. The other note that is quite strong in this is the leather. This isn’t a smooth fragrance it has a rough texture of powder. I don’t get any caramel or cherry. I do get vanilla and a LOT of wood. The leather and woody notes make this somewhat masculine and earthy. I was expecting a very smooth gourmand and this is more of a cocoa powder bomb with leather, wood and some vanilla and like an earthy smell. Yes! The cut hay! It sort of has a hay texture. Different but not my jam."

This fragrance for me was very underwhelming. It just feels 'unfinished' to me. It kept me wanting more. I kept thinking, is that it? All I heard was how this fragrance was Beast mode. NOT!!! Well at least for me it wasn't. I like to smell my fragrances, and I don't want to constantly sniff my clothes or wrists to find it.

Don't get me wrong it's a nice sent. I like it very much, the I love the sweet tonka bean comfort of the fragrance... and it has this powdery cotton candy like texture to it; but for the price, I have other gourmand like scents that perform much better than this one for fraction of the cost.

I'm still on the fence with this one. I do want to buy a bottle but I know myself and will have buyers remorse later... I will finish using my decant, hopefully it will grow on me and maybe I'll change my mind but for now it's just not working for me.

EDIT 3/23/20... This scent is growing on me. Starting to really love it. It's a creeper. Didn't love it out the gate, but becoming more addicted to it the more I use it. Still not the best longevity for me but I do get 4-6 hours out of it, so not too bad. Still don't know about it being beast mode, but it's FB worthy for me now... especially with the rumors of it being discontinued."

The opening is sweet and powdery with a cosmetic bag vibe. I get rich dark vanilla and Iris

(Ambre Nuit, Bois d’argent, and this) This is the winner for me which is saying a lot because I love all three. This mainly smells like cocoa powder and cocoa butter as well as tonka beans. However there’s lots of little nuances I pick up on like the caramel and benzoin throughout the life of this fragrance. If you’re a fan of Noir de Noir I think you’ll love this too. They’re very different scents, however, I think they appeal to similar tastes. Both powdery and sweet. This is the happy go lucky cousin to that fragrance. Just a cool, confident and super warm and charming person whereas noir de noir is dark and mysterious. I adore this fragrance and will have to pick it up for next Autumn. The performance is also really good on this and it lasts me a good 6 hours of solid projection before becoming a skin scent."

I chose exotic Tonka Bean for its slightly bitter roundness. This is a mouth-watering treat that nevertheless retains some mystery."" Fève Délicieuse is one of those fragrances that impel any perfume enthusiast to expand their possessions just by feeling shame or offense to the perfumistic gods for not having in the closet such a perfect work, so pleasant, so round, so full of harmonized elements to please. Fève Délicieuse is something like, for a man, a full and milky female breast: something absolutely irresistible and that you want to try all the time. When spraying, wait 10 minutes for the perfume to settle (until then there is a crazy disharmony), and feel the delicious dry down where everything is submitted to the cocoa king: a cocoa as it appears in the image of notes-grid: pure, powdery, aided by a cloud of delicious things - caramel, sweets, bitter cherry - the third layer at the bottom of the gourmand is the dusty woody floral with makeup aspect, but under control and of high quality. The WOW factor here is the harmony of so many layers: usually perfumes like this - high quality - cause a storm and impel the aroma in several directions at the same time - but here everything goes majestically in unison. I can't think of a perfume MORE unisex and undefined in gender than this one - perfect for men and women to appreciate themselves and their acquaintances.

When I smelled it initially, I honestly thought I’d hate it.

It’s, to me, a baby powder type of bomb initially.
While it calms down, it’s still prevalent. People say from the Tonka bean ( has a vanilla powder smell to it ) I don’t know what a Tonka Bean smells like, but if this is it, then there you go.

Overall, I enjoyed it, Is it something to run out for? You seriously need to try and test it for yourself.

While to me, this is a beautiful, powdery fragrance, this is not going to be for everyone and it would be wise to try and sample it before running out for it. It is not a cheap one.

I will personally have this in my arsenal, I do enjoy its composition overall.

Because of it’s powdery nature, it best fits in the cold weather for sure."

It smells like when my mom asks me to get something inside her bag full of makeup, money, and perfumes, lipstick, this is what I smell. The cacao here is not chocolate milk, cacao bean, or dark choco, it's cacao powder. But it's good it's unique, I could drink the bottle and die from it. Not the best gourmand but the most unique. It also smells really high class, elegant and high quality. This is exactly the scent of what I imagined inside a dior beautiful boutique smelling test strips. Really Unisex, my mom says it's really masculine but for me it's really feminine. It is really in that level of genderlessness.

This is better than tonka imperiale imho. I think guerlain was not informed that tonka gets really sour on skin it smells like dried saliva on 4 hour mark, so i think dior added cherries, and their powdery signature to prevent the tonka getting sour on skin."

The scent itself is very bitter in the beginning, that is until it dries down to a warm and creamy vanilla / tonka combo with a bit of cherry in there. I purchased this thinking it'd have something in common with L'Homme Ideal EDP (which I love) but I was incredibly wrong. This is a totally different beast. It's effortlessly sensual and elegant.

I tried it in the winter and the aromatic quality on my skin gave me a minty, cool vibe that made me think it was a ghost with no soul. I was told it would be too cloying in the summer. From this point on, I am going to try ALL my “winter” scents that didn’t work for me THIS AUGUST. Due to the airy nature of this perfume, it totally works for me in the summer, and now I feel bad about bashing this one. It is the best tonka bean ever and is a fantastic substitute for those tiresome “citric summer scents” that I have been wearing all summer, while thinking in my head “Well, I am supposed to be wearing these fresh citruses”. Wrong. Sometimes, those fresh citruses turn sweaty in the dry-down in the summer, while sweet scents don't. Not all skin chemistry is the same, and nor is the climate of where you live, so a winter scent JUST MIGHT only work in the summer, as does this one on me (and today is hot). It is not overbearing at all, and all the negative facets of this perfume that I smelled in the winter are not apparent in August. I spray far away from my arm, just one spray, and it turns into a freshie this summer."
Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","I get a strong vibe of baby powder from this - could be the vanillic notes combined with the powdery cocoa. The slight bitterness of the caramel makes sure the fragrance doesn't get too cloying, and overall this isn't a syrupy, sticky scent; instead, it's a fluffy powdery one.

Around an hour or two later, the tonka bean becomes more prominent, giving it a bit of hay-like nuances. However, when blended with the baby powder notes from the opening, it somehow becomes violet-like, which I'm not a fan of.

This is undoubtedly a well-blended fragrance, but it's a pass for me. Maybe it's my skin chemistry."

unisex, leaning feminine (in my opinion, as someone who prefers unisex scents that lean masculine). wonderful performance.

for the baddies out there, this is something a bit more subtle yet unique. and for the more conservative sprayers looking to branch out, here is a great start.

to my nose when first sprayed it smells straight up like baby powder.. then it turns woody, i smell ceder & sandalwood.. hints of vanilla, the almond comes through a bit bitter. this fragrance is the best definition of unisex! like its as unisex as it gets, it really could go either way..

my opinion overall.. i like the fragrance quite a bit, does it live up to the hype? meh.. like i said its okay, a good fragrance but for the price? i get more compliments from savauge & if i were going to buy a fragrance for my woman i'd probably get her joy.. with that said, i don't dislike this fragrance but i enjoy other fragrances from dior better.. definitely sample before you buy, i wouldnt be upset if i blind bought this but there are fragrances i'd rather have first personally.. with that said, get your nose on this one for sure. even though its not an absolute favorite of mine it gets a thumbs up from me"
Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","Ok, I never thought I will ever find and try this perfume. I used to love Dior before the ""reformulation game"" started with my signature called Miss Dior EDP-2012.

They used to advertise it as a gourmand masterpiece and yes it is! I would agree 100% with someone compared it with Poison Girl's vibes. Tonka bean is the key. For me it's like a baby of Pure Poison EDT (very first edition in the bottle where you can wear it by the cap, no spray) and Poison Girl EDP.

I am the one who used to say wear your perfume no matter the season but this one is a perfect for winter. I use to wear Poison Girl EDP during summer that gives a complete different character compared to cooler climates. I am really curious to see Feve Delicieuse during the heat. So, if you're a lover of Tobacco Vanille from Tom Ford or in general gourmand-rich vanillic fragrances, that gem shouldn't be missed from your collection! It's completely unisex, maybe 55% feminine-45% masculine.

It starts with a blast of spices, I would put my hand on fire I can detect asteroid anise, but it could also be the combination of cedar + sandalwood or the touches of leather-benzoin-cacao-a bit of indolic jasmine too. You can't detect something clearly but definitely tonka bean is the main star. So, a warm oriental opening followed by an overdose of sweetness that doesn't let it be sickly sweet. The lasting power is amazing as well as the sillage. It's like a time travel perfume. For a reason it reminds me of hugs with my God mother back to 90's, probably she is a Dior girl. In a few words, a unisex gourmand masterpiece that is as classic as modern, strong, nostalgic, warm and intense, rich, very well blended, vanillic but bitter too, a true compliment getter that is not going to disappoint anyone. The only reason I wouldn't buy it is that I already have similar perfume types. Vanilla lovers, go and smell it now!!!"

Truly i don't think i have ever come a fragrance as complex as Fev, yet so well blended. Looking at the notes it seems like the notes are all over the place: lavender with cherry? Caramel with milk? Mint and bergamot? The notes would make you believe that it would be a VERY WEIRD smelling fragrance.

This is also a journeyed fragrance; as time goes on more and more of the notes come out to where the perfume literally changes.
It opens with Tonka Bean, then the lavender and cocoa comes out, then the dry down is vanilla with those woody notes. But to put it simply:

Opening: Tonka Bean
Middle: a powdery lavender, cherry soap
Dry Down: Vanilla, woods with a hint of hay and powder

I also think that this is a fragrance that can be worn all year round. I do think it's strong so maybe it's not completely suitable for the intense heat, but it isn't overly sweet. Just go lightly on the sprays and it would be great.

This is probably one of my favorite niche fragrances i have tried so far.

Amazing, amazing fragrance!!

Edit 3/15/19 : My previous review didn't give FD enough credit. I've been wearing it more and still stand by what I said, but it's deserving of a more thoughtful review. It's not just Poison Girl+ Mon Guerlain+cedar, it's more substantial and refined than those, especially in the opening. The essence of the fragrance, namely the dry phases, is where my mind goes to designer Dior+ a few other things.

Feve D by all accounts is delicious. I think of cherry amaretto soaked spice cake every time I smell it. I like it a lot, it's cozy. I know it's a Dior by that tonka note. It's the same tonka I find in Addict as well as Poison Girl. The opening is wonderful, but when it dries down it starts to lose me. Long lasting, yes."

However, I found Fève Délicieuse to only be a strong like for me. There is something missing to wow me into making the purchase.

I find the scent heavy and warm, but projection is lighter. After 30 minutes it becomes a skin scent on me.

It’s not super sweet, and is a well blended gourmand, but there was nothing special about it. I didn’t bring my wrists to re-sniff them.

I’m glad I only got a sample. Sometimes it’s hard to go against the grain on something that is such a huge love for so many people. But it just wasn’t the gourmand scent for me. For the price, I recommend sampling the scent before blind buying."

I became kinda interested in it so I ordered a 5 ml decant.
Well don’t get me wrong,it is not a bad perfume ,far from it actually. I really liked it,it smelled of beautifully blended quality ingredients yet ,to me it just doesn’t justify its price. It smells like a delicious mug of cocoa with a generous portion of cinnamon, a hint of coffee and vanilla. Maybe due to the praising words I expected something extraordinary but it is a pleasant gourmand and that’s it.
Silage is not too strong on me ,sits pretty close to the skin but that’s okay I can smell it. Longevity is tremendous,8-10 hours.
So all in all I think this is a great scent but it is not as complex as I expected (and hoped for)."

There are plenty of sellers. Even though this fragrance is gorgeous, it is too expensive to blind-buy.

There is no food to compare it to. It is a gourmand, but it does not smell like food or dessert. It is a very special kind of gourmand. Very airy and transparent."
Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","To people who actually own a bottle of this and no matter where you are from...

So, I am just curious as to whether you think it's worth it to buy the whole bottle (Which costs hundreds of dollars for a starter size of 125mL) or I should try out decanted ones first?! I personally just got into fragrances the last couple of months and heard so many good things about this one especially I'm a girl who's still in my mid 20s and I have figured that I'm into gourmand sweet/floral (esp rose)/fruity scents mostly (I also like floral woody scents I find recently). This is my first review/question post on fragrantica (I've been obsessed with reading about these perfumes as I went about on this perfumery journey). I've been looking to build my small perfume collection (I own about 15 perfumes now). Do you guys think this is a worth buying? I'm looking forward to your response. :)

If you were to describe this scent as food what would you say it is? I really am hoping this smells like some sort of dessert.

EDIT (19/12): I received my decant 30mL from eBay. I made sure I bought from a reputable seller. However, it just sprayed out & smelt so watered down (tried few sprays still the same). Maybe it's because of the spray head of the atomiser? Still...it spreaded out like body spray more like water on the skin with my fingertips and had no sheen on the surface of my skin just like a body spray comparing to the other decant I purchased from him (Hermes Ambres Narguile). It didn't smell like it would last long either even after three sprays I could already tell it's gonna disappear in an hour. I also tested it with a recent purchase of mine - Kim K's Pure Honey which ironically smells even stronger than this decanted Feve Delicieuse...Is my nose going crazy or what?! I am very concerned at this point. I have messaged the seller. The Hermes Ambres Narguile decant I bought from him seemed fine though.

He just got back to me and said his bottle is from 2018 March and said he had few people asked him about the batch year. He said he did just decant straight from the bottle. I will have to find that out by going to a Dior Boutique in Sydney and smell the actual thing. I won't leave him feedback till I find out the truth.

EDIT (20/12): It did last quite a bit but I wouldnt call it strong (definitely not as strong as Aventus for him & for her nor B2B by Kilian.) Yes so I think I received a genuine item, its just that this perfume formula is more watery than I am used to. It is still pretty strong though. projected for a few hours and lasted on the skin for at least 8. Sorry for causing misunderstanding guys."
Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']",Best gourmand ever!!You can tell they used good quality ingredients to create this long lasting beauty!!
Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","Ok now, did the comparison between 2015 and 2018 on the 2018's profile.

The fragrance itself is all about tonka (which is pretty obvious). Shows plenty of layers of that note and is a complex beast.

Opens up with a delicate and smooth citrus blast (hard to say which exactly and it's only a twist for me). And soon the main star swoops in.

It is a very vibrant fragrance on my skin and there are plenty of facets it shows on my skin. The main themes are tonka, almonds, cherries, soft sandalwood, milky aspects, hints of chocolate, leather, dark cocoa, a pinch of coffee.

Actually these are notes that I can detect and didn't look into the notes breakdown.

It is a fragrance I'm still getting familiar with. Surely it's cozy, comforting and gathers plenty of compliments. And the sweet tooth aspect is there - if you don't like gourmands, it may be cloying for you.

Average longevity is 15 hours, sillage is quite big so 2 sprays are good for me. If I want to smell like Feve but less ""invasive"" I spray one spray on my chest or on the front of my neck and I'm good to go.

Gets me compliments, but I use it during fall nights or in winter (both day,evening and night outs)."
Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","Gawd, but I am a sucker for that tonka bean; it rids me of my usual cynicism,
so I procured my bitter self a healthy dose of straight-up tonka essence, but unfortunately, it’s not really great on the skin by itself, tantamount to applying pure Madagascan vanilla bean extract behind your ears in order to smell like custard; it’s all down to those pesky molecules, and how large or small they may be. Tonka bean is nearly spot-on anise + cherry tobacco + fresh hay + a pinch of cocoa (for me) without the bitterness or acidity, and tonka done well isn’t an easy task. This “Delicious Bean”, however, is precisely what it’s meant to be; tonka bean executed superbly. A true tonka triumph (say it five times at top speed—I dare you)...

If I only enjoyed what the myriad bloggers and critics approve of, I wouldn’t appreciate, much less own a good portion of my collection; good for my bank account, bad for my soul. FD is as sumptuous in the heat of summer, as it is in the autumn, and I find that it’s even better tucked away in valleys of warmth, like the inner elbows & thighs, cleavage, and between the shoulder blades, where our wings used to be, before we fell to Earth.

Utilising the typically cool, almost mentholated lavender & mint as mixers in a cosy gourmand have the potential to go very wrong, like cucumbers in a stew, or fried watermelon. However, the aromatic features of both are blended expertly here, and lend clean warmth, not medicinal aloofness, and combined with the leather, sandalwood & cedar, the results are nothing short of a seriously grown-up (but not at all stuffy), balanced gourmand, that’s all cognac and no cookie. FD : A*Men as Godiva : Hershey’s, simply dependant upon preference, and I think that fans of L’Occitane’s original fragrances, such as 4 Voleurs, Eau des Baux, Vanilla Bourbon, etc. may find their “signature” here.

Aveda used to carry the most wonderfully aromatic herbal tea that contained a goodly dose of anise, and although totally sugar-free, it was subtly sweet to perfection. FD is a bit reminiscent of the aroma and flavour of that lovely tea, and in fact, wouldn’t be out of place in Aveda’s (sadly, and bafflingly, discontinued) home fragrances line.

A few of the reviews posted here appear to be for an entirely different fragrance from the one in the 2015 (batch 5T01) bottle that I own. I have the massive, 250ml bottle, so if anyone wants to try 10mls at a bargain, please shoot me a message; I’ll never use all of this in a hundred years, seriously."

I got nothin'. It's light, pleasant, elegant, well blended, but that's it. Safe for office wear, but I don't work in an office so I will give this one a pass.

Tonka, vanilla, spice, tobacco, and all the good stuff I was looking for, but much too light to notice. Several hours in, I don't get any mint, medicinal notes, or powder. It's a very nice skin scent, but toooooo soft. Dial it up a bit and I'd wear it often.

If you appreciate delicate and beautiful unisex* fragrances, go for it.

Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","Note: This review is for the 'reformulated' version. The comparison with the vintage is at the end of the review.

My girlfriend sprayed ONE spray on her wrist and distributed it on her other wrist and on her neck (this was a sample spray, which is not even a third of a bottle spray), one hour before meeting her. The sillage was wonderful, smooth, soft, airy. She smelled divine and I could not stop myself from taking every chance to inhale this beautiful scent cloud. I could smell her the entire day. The next day, when I woke up and snuggled up to her, I could still smell it! This was 18h after the initial spray.

It has around four hours of soft/average projection (40-50 cm). After this, it get closer to the skin (±20 cm) for another four hours. It finally becomes a skin-scent and slowly fades away, eighteen hours after the initial spray. Keep in mind that this is one sample spray, smeared out over four pulse points.

On her it smelled sweeter than it did on me and I could smell more vanilla. On me, the tonka bean note turned more bitter, which made it a bit more masculine. However, in my opinion this fragrance is more on the feminine side.

After spending a divine day in this cloud of deliciousness, I managed to pick up a 125ml 'vintage' bottle for a very gentle price.

Reformulated:
Scent: 12/10 (On my girl)
Projection: 10/10 (Soft, like a fragrance like this should be)
Sillage: 10/10 (Silky smooth sillage, lasts 8h+)
Longevity: 10/10 (18h+ on skin)
Versatility 9/10
Uniqueness: 9/10
Price-performance: 7/10 (Can be a bit pricey for some)
Total: 9.5/10 (This juice is a near perfect gourmand)

Vintage:
Scent: 12/10 (A bit more rich than the reform.)
Projection: 11/10 (A bit heavier than the reform.)
Sillage: 10/10 (Feels a bit thicker, but still silky smooth sillage, lasts 9h+)
Longevity: 11/10 (20h+ on skin)
Versatility 9/10
Uniqueness: 9/10
Price-performance: 6/10 (Vintage is a bit expensive on eBay. Not different enough from the reformulated version to justify for the higher price)
Total: 9.75/10 (I did not include the price)

I can honestly say that you do not need to search for a vintage bottle. I can imagine that when you only know the vintage Fève, you will be slightly dissapointed with the reformulation. However, even though the vintage is a bit thicker and richer, the higher prices on eBay do not justify the little bit of extra quality you get. Just get a bottle of the reformulated juice. It is still a 9.5 for me."

I picked it up because of the gourmand notes, especially the praline, and all the great reviews for it. I was and am disappointed it hasn't worked for me.

I think this is a scent that should be tried before purchasing.

For all the gourmand ingredients in its base, the top and middle ingredients that are not gourmand unfortunately take over the entire experience for me.

I got a sample (not sure about which batch) and have worn it a few times and it garnered compliments from more than one person each time. Especially women seem to love it, which surprised me - I thought women like 'butcher' scents on men, and this is decidedly unisex.

It's a heavenly, creamy, slightly spicy tonka/vanilla/caramel with an interesting 'clean' streak - there are moments where I feel I almost smell whiffs of citrus or classic men's cologne in there, and then it reverts back to a decadent gourmand. The projection and lasting power are excellent, too. It easily lasts 24 hours on clothes and even on skin it lasts about 4 hours with projection (strong at first and then goes down to medium) and then becomes a skin scent for another 4 or so.

This version was launched in 2015 as part of ""La Collection Privée"". It is an EDP and - at the moment at least - is showing as having several notes.

The other version has been/will be launched this year i.e. 2018, is an EDP and - at the moment - is showing as having only one note (tonka). I don't think the 2018 version is part of an ""exclusive"" collection; I also don't know whether the retail price will remain as high either.

The nose behind both fragrances is Francois Demachy. I bought this version, which I adore, before even trying the newer version, as I was concerned that I may not like the newer one as much.

It lasts forever! I sprayed it on my scarf and I could still smell it a week later. You'll leave a trail of mouthwatering goodness behind you and sabotage anyone on a diet.

My favourite is (or, more accurately - was) Guerlain Elixir Charnel Oriental Brulant.

A year or so ago I received a small decant of Feve Delicieuse from a swap partner (sadly I can't remember who sent it to me, so don't know who to blame for the enormous void in my bank account). Suffice to say, the small decant was NOT enough.

I had to have a FB. When I read that it was being re-launched (and potentially reformulated), the need became pressing, so I just bought a virtually full 125ml bottle (which checkcosmetic dates to September 2017) from a reliable seller on eBay. It was not cheap. In fact this is the most I have ever spent on one bottle of perfume.

Feve Delicieuse is so well blended, I can't really differentiate between the notes; there's nothing I can really contribute to the glowing reviews below mine, anyway.

I am sitting here now, enveloped in a blissful, warm delicious cloud of what is - potentially - my favourite perfume of all time. I don't regret the expenditure. In fact I couldn't be happier.

ETA. I have sprayed a little Reminiscence Tonka on the back of my right hand and - now it's dried down - am comparing it to Feve Delicieuse on the back of my left hand. Tonka is an EDT, it's about 1/4 price of FD, the sillage is less, it's nowhere near as smooth as Feve Delicieuse (hardly surprising), BUT it is lovely and there are definitely some similarities. Give it a try as a cheap and cheerful... I can't say it's an alternative, because it's not. But give it a try anyway."
Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","I started off with a small, in fact tiny sample of this fume and before I even opened the plastic baggy I could smell it. I then upgraded to a 5ml sample which dropped on the floor and broke, spilling this fine liquid all over my washroom. So I bought another 5ml sample and then I decided, this is it, I NEED to own a large bottle, just like I did with oud ispahan despite the lux prices on ebay (unfortunately cannot get dior private online to Canada, sigh).

So lots of $$$ later and some waiting time for it to arrive, I own a huge bottle of this stuff and have been using it almost weekly for months, barely making a dent as this is a very STRONG, powerful concoction, much like oud ispahan (my other dior love) and TOTALLY worth the price.

I've never been a super gourmand fan, I don't really enjoy the smell of sweets or tonka, find it too sharp for my nose. However, this gourmand is like the king/queen of all gourmands and it isn't just sweet, it is also sophisticated so you don't smell like a teeny bopper wearing some kind of sticky vanilla caramel fume at the mall.

It's a fine, fine tonka, very smooth and well blended without sharpness, with the addition of creamy almond, spicy vanilla, perfectly melted caramel and the freshness of mint. It goes on strong, like gasoline strong but it settles into the most wonderful, comforting lullaby of a scent. This would be so perfect in the winter, especially during the holidays to be worn by the fire. Or even better, outdoors with a campfire, the two melding together would smell heavenly. I don't think this can be pulled off too well in the summer heat, it is very strong. I can imagine it might work if blended delicately with something else.

Very impressive, another beautiful favorite from the house of Dior. A must, must, must try for gourmand lovers. And those who don't like gourmands, just give it a shot. It may convert you!"

I love gourmands. Full stop. However this is a lot more on me. It starts with a blast of almost bitter medicinal herbs (including lavender - yes, I know it's not listed but it's definitely here on me) and then evolves into a rich, smooth, warm, sensual base once the tonka and vanilla come out. And do they ever last. This is what Mon Guerlain (which I actually do like, to be fair) wants to be when it grows up.

It's actually not that sweet on me. I think it's perfectly unisex actually."

It's not too sweet beacuse it's mixed with a mastic note (not listed in the notes).

This is really a great composition beacuse it dose remind you of dessert yet still smells aromatic. It has a powdery clean heart that's very subtle and helps other notes standout.

Very artistic, complex and performs well.
smells of things you would encounter naturally. Really fun fragrance to have!"

I was lucky-I bought a 5ml decant and can get my fix from that, so I don't have to sell my first-born, but I could very easily just sit and sniff this all day. This is alchemy, its witchcraft-I normally don't like sweet scents and I don't go for gourmands, I don't tend towards sugary vanilla nutty notes, so how come with all these notes this just comes together so beautifully and so completely perfectly? There is a lovely robustness to this, despite being sweet, it is very much unisex, it's grounded with an underlying slightly leather/smoke/woodburning stove note. Longevity is about 10 hours on me and the drydown is lovely through all stages, there isn't a single jarring note."
Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","Ok, so to put this review into context, I am a pharmacy fragrance manager and I basically work on minimum wage and favour wearing pricier mainstream fragrances (Dior Homme range, Guerlain, Mugler, etc.) because I can afford them as a luxury.
Anyway today I was in the Melbourne CBD doing some light clothes shopping, and it starts absolutely BUCKETING down rain. Like, I'm talking heaven's floodgates opened into a small cyclone (not quite, but you get the picture). So I am conveniently stranded outside a Dior Boutique which sells women's accessories, like handbags and purses, etc. and I decide to go in and wait out the rain. I spot this beauty, alongside some of the other fragrances in this line. I see the price and I'm like huh, that's like fourteen years of overtime, but I'll smell it anyway.

Anyway, now I'm home with a 250ml bottle next to me and I'm absolutely paralysed with debt but oh GOD this is good.
I can't tell you what this does to my senses but I'll tell you one thing. Best $450 AUD ever spent.

The scent itself is surprisingly masculine - I have never smelled a gourmand fragrance that has been so un-sweet girly. It's opulent and rich and milky and boozy and just plain beautiful. I sprayed once on my arm to try it on my skin when I got home, and that one spray was enough to fill the space some good feet around me with this delicious aura. This is definitely a special event fragrance - I'm not talking ""date night"" or ""dinner with the in-laws"", I'm talking meeting the goddamn queen or marrying Hugh Jackman or something. DAMN.

I'm not religious but I am ready to go to church to thank god for making it pour when it did because otherwise I would have walked right on past. Seriously good stuff. I can see how it may not be for everyone, but I'm so glad my chemistry works.

Now, please excuse me while I go and take out a home loan to get some backup bottles, because I don't want to be without this."

I was heartbroken by this due to the praise this recieves. On me, it’s smells like an annoying, powdery, sweet, inexpensive, waxy candle. I just don’t get it- how I like it in the air but certainly not on me. Thoughts of play dough come to mind. Pass for me."
Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","There is a pinch of mint and lavender in the top that is almost like toothpaste, but it rapidly vanishes under a wave of delicious boozy vanilla, tonka, and caramel. While it's not fruity per se, something about it reminds me of eating bananas foster.

There isn't much internal contrast here (it's sweet vs. sweet), but for all its intensity it has a lot of lift, and the sillage feels transparent and not custardy the way some vanillas can smell. It lasts half-way to forever, of course.

It's extremely sweet and extremely foody, so go too heavy on this, and you'll be waterboarded in vanilla pancake syrup, but with a light touch, it's a great comfort scent.

Not the smartest fragrance around, but viscerally pleasing the way the smell of baking cookies is."

It's a truly lovely dark-sweet scent, tonka with a splash of milky vanilla and some tobacco-like earthiness. Not as assertive as Tobacco Vanille (at least, the way I remember Tobacco Vanille from sampling it years ago); nicely toes the powdery-sweet line without crossing it, and has enough depth to make it interesting rather than straight-up dessert. (See, this is why I like tonka better than vanilla.) Never gets too cloying for me. Just yummy."

The opening consists of lavender greenness and a sweet vanilla and tonka.. it then dries down to a powdery honey cacao vanilla tonka cinnamon sexiness.. what remains after around 6-8 hours is a perfect creamy realistic French Vanilla note that is just divine.. I agree with a few people on here who say it kind of smells like baby powder.. I totally get this but it is NOT a bad thing.. It's beautifully created and actually does have a slight bitterness to the tonka like Francois claims.. It's honestly brilliantly created and is a work of art whether you enjoy the fragrance yourself.. I've just ordered 125ml, so you can see I love this one ;) Longevity is great I get around 12 hours, a projection is good within an arms length or just outside an arms length..

Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","While Dior have always been known as quite a creative force in the world of mainstream, designer fragrances, their privee line seems less focused on innovation and more on sheer quality. On the surface Feve Delicieuse is pure gourmand, but that assessment is just a little bit lazy. Gourmands tend to be olfactory sweet tooth remedies, but Feve Delicieuse isn't nearly as edible as the notes would lead you to believe. Many users mention a cherry note, and I'm not sure if that's official or not. But the ""cherry"" is subtle, and may even just be a sign of good quality almond. I say that because it's extremely reminiscent of Amaretto, the sweet Italian liquor. But it's not boozy either, and I wouldn't even call it heavy even though it begs to be worn in the winter. It's actually quite bright.

There's great contrast here, and that keeps this scent different from all the Pure Havanes and Back to Blacks. Tonka and cacao can be extremely bitter at times, and they weren't afraid to let some of that bitterness shine through. In fact, they embrace it. This results in a magnificently balanced fragrance. There is a slight similarity to Dior Homme Intense, but no cosmetic bag/lipstick residue to be found. It's not cheap by any means, but that's kind of the point of having a private line.

Performance is above average as it should be, and I can smell it on my skin for twenty four hours. It makes its presence known but remains polite. When you're dealing with such culinary notes you don't want to be assaulting the people around you. So thanks for keeping it classy Dior. It's pretty versatile and can be used anywhere as long as you're not too trigger happy. Summer may be risky but that's the story of every gourmand isn't it? I tend to go for these kinds of winter friendly scents, and I'm trying hard not to let my bias show but it's tough. Winter is right around the corner and I cannot wait to wear the hell out of this."

The wafts were so mouth-watering that it started to make me feel a bit hungry. The scent character is very special. Unfortunately, from my first test of this, it dried into basic vanilla within half an hour. This made me absolutely gutted as i thought this could become one of my favourite scents for a little bit. I will however put way more sprays on next time since i only used 3 from my sample and i guess that is like 1 spray from a full bottle. I am hoping that it performs much better on the next try and doesn't just burn straight into a generic vanilla smell again as i really want to love this one because of that stunning first half hour. My wallet on the other hand is praying this continues not to work on me lol."

I wouldn’t recommend a blind buy on this as it’s definitely unique and different.

I was never a fan of the few sugary sweet vanilla scents floating around, but what I didn't realize is that gourmands can be dirty and magnificent. Feve Delicieuse is one of those.

I love vanilla. I love tonka. But I don't want an overly sweet sugary blast. The astounding layers in this masterpiece reveal themselves slowly and lazily in a kinda here I am baby sexy sorta way. I get the leather early on, as well as the sandalwood and cacao. Earthy, grounding and keeps this fragrance from being too feminine and run of the mill.

I can barely detect any of the floral notes - although I do sense a bit of the lavender at play. This is so well crafted and blended, but it's a pity it's so expensive. Perhaps offering it in smaller bottles will mean more people can enjoy this rare beauty.

The projection is good, and on me it lasts a decent 5-6 hours. I would imagine this would smell sexy as hell on a man, but I love it on me. And I wear fragrance for me. So - I'm happy.

While more of a cool weather scent - I won't be putting this away for the warmer months. There are just days when I need a bit of a fragrance boost - and Feve makes me feel a little taller, a little sexier, and just a little bit bad."

Confectionery without falling into the trap of smelling like a Christmas candle.

The SA tried to steer me towards the ""latest"" Miss Dior but my horrified expression and quick beeline for the exclusives section must have convinced her to leave me alone. For those who are trying to imagine what this smells like from the reviews, here's something that might help. To me Feve Delicieuse reminds me a lot of Chergui sans tobacco, but with high quality black cherry flavouring. The opening is a little quirky, I definitely get an unlisted fennel seed/licorice vibe. Very strong but gone in minutes.

I love reading all the reviews of the any fragrance before contributing mine and a few struck me so I'm gonna bounce some ideas off em. One mentioned it's not sweet at all. Oh boy, I think I'm with the majority on this: FD is mega-sweet. It's foody, desserty sweet. It actually made me think of one of my favourite dessert, Danone's Greek-style yoghurt in black cherry flavour. It makes me wanna go om-nom-nom.

On the other hand, it's not completely gourmandy. It has one foot in the gourmand category and another firmly in Amber territory. It becomes more of an amber to me as time progresses. I don't think this is the 'gourmand to end all gourmands' because it's such a huge fragrance family. I mean, let's not forget the Turkish delights, the almond-amaretto, the baked gingerbreads, lemon meringues, to name a few, that make up this fantastic fragrance group. That said, if a cherry, tonka, caramel fix is what you need right now, Feve Delicieuse will be a hit. I do enjoy it a lot."

After trying it out again, it has a bit more complexity to it, although I am not sure I like it much better. On my skin it starts off with an almost powdery tonka bean. There is a faint waxy smell that almost smells like lipstick, accompanying the opening. The heart smells like sweet powder with a hint of musk. The dry down on me smells like what I first remembered; that syrupy one note vanilla sweetness with the tiniest hint of caramel to make it even sweeter.

If you are the kind that loves vanilla/ tonka/caramel creaminess - Go for this one. Not a stunner of a fragrance but surely smells yummy and absolutely stands up to its name.
Makes a good date scent I think. Wear it on a cool evening and just enjoy the fragrance. It lasts around 5-6 hours on me. It lasts longer on clothes and when people pass you, they will keep getting whiffs of this sexy fragrance for the entire evening/day. Even as a skin scent, it smells really delicious. Always puts a smile on my face.
Highly recommend this fragrance. Im not sure about women, but as a man, I don't see myself wearing this each and every day. Id surely get bored of it, but its amazing as that once-in-a-while fragrance, I do that so I'm always in love with it too. Fantastic formulation of a scent by Dior.
Wear it to :
Work/date/movies/outdoor and indoor dinners/indoor lunches. Spring and winters - days and nights."

This is holiday in a bottle for me. I wear this from thanksgiving until Christmas along with Burberry London. Opening is tart cherry then settles to a milky, creamy, powdery tonka based scent with hints of cherry lingering off and on with chocolate notes. It is thick and dense. After a half hour, it smells like a beautiful cappuccino with a hint of tart cherry creeping back in. Im starting to love this one."

It is an amazing, complex fragrance and if you are into gourmands, it is a must try!

Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","A very complex, dense fragrance. I really thought (based on the note breakdown) it would be a lot sweeter and not as heavy. It is very heavy on tonka bean, vanilla and cocoa. It is very nicely blended, but I wouldn't call it a very appealing fragrance, it can be appreciated for the art, not the complement factor. Even though it is unisex, I would rather smell this on a woman than myself, that is because not evey man could pull this one off and if a woman comments on this, it's that she would wear it. So take what you can from this, if you wear fragrances for yourself and the art, sure get it. If it's for casual wear and compliments, skip it as it is quite expensive. I would recommend getting a sample and seeing if you like it or not.
EDIT: My goodness, I always have to take a second try to really appreciate a fragrance, And man, this is just amazing. Powdery tonka, chocolate-y cocoa, warm vanilla, some sweet praline (and a slight hint of milkyness to it) are the notes that shine through this fragrance. It is so well blended and is truly a work of art. It is a must try, yet I still stand by the fact that it should be sampled first as not everybody can appreciate it. It's like going to a Michelin Star restaurant, very expensive and it would mostly appeal to a gourmand, so it is a hit or miss. If you love fragrances and want something that is done amazingly (and you're tired of all those generic fragrances) try this out."

Smells like a honey powder bomb on me for a couple of hrs, then it's a skin scent. I do like the minty freshness in the opening but the rest is meh. The best part of this fragrance was after it became a skin scent then disappeared. Reminded me a lot of By Killian Back to Black - though FD is more complex.

My husband told me I reeked of sweet baby powder. yeah....not what I was going for."
Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","I went a little crazy and ordered a big bottle blind based on several statements I read online about this fragrance:
- it is a gourmand that doesn't really smell 100% gourmand, but also smells a lot like a makeup bag
- it's a fragrance made of gourmand notes, but doesn't smell too sweet or like a desert
- it smells like a child of L'Heure Bleue and Dior Homme

I'm happy to say they all are true and that I finally found an ""almost gourmand"" or ""not exactly a gourmand"" fragrance I can tolerate/wear without that ""what was I thinking?"" feeling that I usually get when exploring this type of perfume. YAY!"

I love just about all of the sweet and gourmand notes except one. That one is caramel. On my skin I have figured out that caramel is extremely feminine and mixed with notes that already are on the feminine side it's a big no no for me. This is the type of gourmand that is long lasting and not so in your face. It could be the perfect signature for a true gourmand lover, man or woman, just not me."

Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']",I received this today as a blind buy. I like gourmand ... I love my Salvatore Ferragama Uomo but this is clearly for a woman. This is clearly for a woman. Someone made the commment that this smells like his girlfriends makeup bag. That was so SPOT ON. Nevertheless Very nice!
Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","I am a full-on gourmand lover. I am one of those people that thinks everybody should smell sweet in winter. I have about 100 sweet fragrances that range from full-on cupcake (Demeter series, L'Aromarine/Outremer vanilla oil) to sweet, refined elegance (VCA orchidee vanille, Guerlain and other posh vanillas) and I layer according to how much of a sugar high I need to get through the long dark and dreary freezing day.

Having learned a bit of french in my school years, the word ""Delicieuse"" struck me like lightning. I had to try it. I had absolutely no idea what Feve was (I told you I only learned a ""bit""!!) but from the word delicious I was dreaming up all sorts of buttercreamy goodness, a heavenly dessert, another ode to my vanilla freak-ness. but I was surprised. no vanilla in sight on the first spray. what I smelled was a little green. and dry..? I wasn't used to it, and I couldn't make it out. what is it, cocoa powder? I was confused. It makes sense now because I have no tonka-centered fragrances in my ever extending cupcake collection. I have lots of fragrances that had it as a sub-character, but none that hailed it as the queen.

So I thought nah and walked on- I don't want to smell like cocoa powder, I need creme brulee! I need mille-feuille!I need cinnamon rolls! fudge! caramel! maple syrup!(you get the idea...)

and after I'd completely forgotten about it and was oohing and aaahing over some hideously expensive jewelry courtesy of the ever lovely Bvlgari, it hit me. I didn't really know what it was at first, I looked at my friend in wonder- had she sprayed something on when we were gallivanting around the fragrance department? what was this dry but uber-silky vanilla, soft praline, hint of rum and where was it coming from?

the minute I realised it was me I dragged my friend all the way back to the department store and got a 250ml bottle on the spot. (I'm quick like that...) for people that say it's expensive, I have two words for you. ""TOM FORD"". it gives you at least double the amount for less.. and as an avid TF collector this line didn't strike me as being insanely pricey. and I generally don't care if I don't like the top notes. it's the mid-to-base notes that I have to love to wear any fragrance, and a measly 30mins of confusion should not deprive you of 10 hours of heaven!

VCA's Orchidee Vanille had pretty much occupied my thoughts ever since christmas as my new star, but now it's 50/50. they are very different, although when it comes to elegance they are on par. VCA is wetter, richer, more intense and dreamier. This one is dry, silky and a little more restrained but exudes fabulousness in its own right.

VCA is the brilliant and gorgeous wife of a billionaire, FD is an aristocrat known for her kindness, soft-spokenness and beauty.

Definitely worth a sniff."

Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']",This scent is a very sweet winter fragrance. It has a prominent vanilla and tonka bean note that I pickup on my skin. Occasionally I'll get whiffs of sandlewood in the background. I love this fragrance. I just ordered another bottle of this. Hopefully that says something.
Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","I don't care much for sweet and vanilla based scents. Feve Delicieuse takes both of these scents to the extreme limit.

I totally hate this fragrance. It gave me continuous headache to the point I had to wash it off."
Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","This goes through so many phases I barely know where to start. This is not a gourmand, it doesn't smell edible. It has a warm grounded vanilla sweetness throughout, but there is nothing foody about it.

In the first spray I get a minty lavender herbal scent with a thick texture to it, almost masculine, reminiscent of some kind of ointment. The herbal effect softens to become calm and nonintrusive, and the perfume transforms into something much more rounded, sweeter and vanillic. There is a prominent cinnamon as well, but no chocolate to my nose. With time this takes an elegant turn into a cosmetic powder and waxy iris, creating a certain classy aura around it.

This is like a sweeter, more cinnamony sister to Xerjoff Lira, which is another masculine leaning, herbal take on vanilla, and cousin to Dzing! by L'Artisan. Feve Delicieuse continues to be one of my favourite scents due to it's unique way and complexity."

Fève Délicieuse Christian Dior (unisex) ~ 2015,"['sweet', 'vanilla', 'amber', 'warm spicy', 'aromatic', 'cacao', 'caramel', 'cherry', 'lactonic', 'nutty']","Alright, so the opening of the frag pretty much smells (just) like my tonka bean absolute (Brazilian source).

Even down to that like.. kinda cinnamon-y feel/smell that the absolute has. Know what I mean?

Now, I'm not sure if this is the tonka bean part, or if it's the vanilla, but Feve Delicieuse has a particular kind of smell that's also with Vanille Absolument (and perhaps Frapin 1697) as well. I'm not sure how to describe it, but if you're aware of those frags, then you may get what I'm talking about.

After a short bit, the vanilla picks up more. I also noticed a kind of iris smell or feeling - like.. a waxy soft thing going on.

So, I may like it better a bit AFTER the opening - so, give it a little time if you don't quite like the opening!

But yeah, if you know what tonka bean absolute smells like, then you pretty much/largely 'know' what Feve Delicieuse smells like.

I look forward to wearing it again. :)"

There is something that is firmly restraining the gourmandiness of this perfume, keeping it on a short leash, I guess it is the lavender mostly and a very green, herbal mint. To my nose the opening is a blast of milky cherry more than anything, but it dries down to a bittersweet concoction. It does remind me a little of... dare I say it... Guerlain La Petite Robe Noire but without the liquorice, added caramelly tonka goodness, something green and unisex appeal."

As it calms down, the caramel comes up quite slowly, the milk goes back, the vanilla remains but turns delicate, and the tonka beans remains on top as the winner!

It feels quite interesting. I have always loved ""New Look 1947"" but i find it's too weak to stand out, and now they have presented this masterpiece.

The only drawback of this whole fragrance is it's price."

Not of the dry autumn/winter time sorts, but late spring time fresh, lush and vibrant green when strobili are out and chlorophyll is high. The fig leaf further adds to the Mediterranean green feel.

On my skin I don't get much floral, if any at all.
In drydown, musk is discernible as is the pistachio, bringing a Maghreb layer to the fresh conifer.

Typical of the craftmanship of Monsieur Ellena, this is an elegant, fresh, yet complex concoction."

Freshly applied, the cedar is so big and so loud that it's just like opening a bag of hamster shavings. Juniper becomes more obvious as it dries down, but there just isn't enough floral sweetness to balance it for me.

I think I might really like this on a man if it were a bit muskier, but it's not for me."

On my skin the citrus fades rather quickly, but I'm left with a slightly sweet and perfectly balanced fig, cedar and juniper that lingers for a long time.

with the opening of this fragrance, you get a citrusy brightness as if you're peeling juicy mandarins and lemons for a delicious refreshing drink, as it gets into the heart notes, you get a soft enveloping floral touch, and finally, the spiciness that emerges from the fig leaf and cypress, which has a gorgeous sparkling effect. un jardin en mediterranee is playful, fresh yet elegant - perfect for the spring and summertime."

To me it smelled like a secret hideout in the greenery and conifers of a villa garden in italy. Especially the juniper was lovely. Years later came across this magical perfume again and was shocked. The conifer trees were nowhere to be found. Did my nose change or was it re formulated? Am hesitant to fork out big bucks to try again.

Polo as a teenager, Light Blue in college, and Jardin Sur la Toit, until one fateful day at an Hermes store, I spritzed my wrists with this stuff. I've never really had this kind of experience with a perfume before, it's not what my friends wore, or what my mom wore, but when I smelled it I thought, ""wow, this is what I want to be associated with!"" The fresh, confident and easy nature nature of the fig, the sweetness cut with cheeky spice...it is really an incredible scent.

It's not for everyone, but if it's for you, then you'll be hard pressed to find something else that comes close. Philosykos is probably the nearest, but a little too cloying."

I didn’t expect to love it this much, I really like the toit and nil, and the rest is meh from the Jardin line, but I hadn’t tried this one yet and after I did... the first reaction after smelling the bottle cap was like meh too, but then it grew on me after i smelt it on the tester paper (don't be fooled by the simple scent from the bottle cap, you should try it on a paper or your skin, then you will see how perfect it is) I smelt something so unique and nice. It is a green freshness, grass-like as in the toit fragrance but it is fairly similar to the nil for its spiciness but this one is definitely more subtle, it's like a more reserved sibling of nil which doesn’t sweep you off your feet right away but with time it becomes your favorite from the rest... It is my second favourite after Toit... man this is so f good."

Then the green mixes with lemon and a tiny hint of floral scent.

After 30 minutes of wearing it, it still smells green, but now it also smells a little bit masculine now, with some sexy man kind of musky zestiness. I do not smell pistachio and orange at all."

Great lasting power and very unique. The Hermes garden series last greater than 12 hours on my clothing. I overspray them and cannot complain. There is a slight melancholy to the scent which I also find in Gucci Memoire d'une Odeur. Like a chamomile effect. I enjoy wearing this fragrance in summer but my husband and kids do not like it.

Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']","Un Jardin En Mediterranee is another excellent perfume by Hermes in the garden series. Another superb effort by Jean-Claude Ellena.

It's a soft perfume which becomes a skin scent fairly swiftly but it lasts a surprisingly long time. I get seven and a half to eight hours before I have to press my nose into my arm to smell it.

I find that it opens with a green blast, some fruit, something of a figgy coconut vibe and once the fruit has gone the rest remains. The smell reminds me in some ways of Diptyke's Philosykos (but better) and also of Monotheme's Mediterranean Coast (but longer lasting). It's one that can be worn easily by both sexes. It seems more obviously for day wear than the night as it does for the warmer weather rather than the colder weather but I wouldn't put you off trying it in those circumstances.

It might just be the best fig perfume."

This is a calm/mellow/grounded/friendly person sort of scent. So easy to wear for daytime especially in the summer. Not much sillage and moderate lasting power but that's OK for this type of warm weather scent. Love it!

I'm not exactly a connoisseur of fig fragrances (it's not a top favorite note of mine) but so far this one is my favorite over others I've sampled like Philosykos, Capri Forget me not, Ichnusa, Womanity Eau pour Elles, Indigo, Premier Figuier, etc. Though I still consider Ninfeo Mio the best in this ""genre""."
Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']",Smells like sap from a fig tree with some supporting green notes. Very cedar intensive which I personally love being a huge fan of cedar. This is probably the “heaviest” wearing experience from the line yet still fairly light to wear. Personally I’d love to wear this fragrance specifically in the spring or fall but especially the fall. The tree sap smell really takes me to Autumn. This projects nicely for ~4 hours at arms radius and from there falls into a skin scent for me. This is probably the most masculine of the Jardin series and my second favorite only barely under Sur Le Nil.
Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']","This is an amazing, zesty, uplifting, hot weather scent. We have been suddenly blessed with not warm, but hot and humid summer days here in south of England and this is one of the scents that has just been a complete pleasure to surround oneself with. Its delicious and delightful, and like its name, makes me think of mediterranean sunshine and breeze and lush gardens dripping with flowers. Whereas both un Jardin de Monsieur Li and Un Jardin sur le Toit have a leaning towards more masculine end of the unispectrum, this, to me, leans more to the feminine. Its citrucy, yellow, sunshine with a touch of aromatic and a hint of woody just to give it structure. I absolutely love the Un Jardin sur le Nil, which for me is the best of the series, this is a bit ‘easier’ and more familiar but complex enough to keep the nose interested. Its really the mediterranean sun in a bottle. Love this."

There is no better option for me when it comes to hot summer days and you dressed up like Dickie from the Talented Mr. Ripley. I have 4 of them and I can’t place one over another. Just love them all. Citrus colognes and aquatics give you a freshness and nice smell, but only fig ones make you classy. The compliments I’ve got wearing fig scents differ from others.

If the cyan color has smell it would smell like Un Jardin en Mediterranee — pounded fig leaves and mastic tree. Yeah, not pistachio, but green mastic wood. There are a few notes more like: cedar, bergamot, orange blossom, and oleander. As with every fig scent, this one has some shampooness to it, nevertheless, it is beautiful.

It’s the elegant freshness of the Mediterranean twilights, whenever breeze started to change its course and you get all those tree vibes.
Amazing thing and it’s absolutely understandable why Hermes hired Ellena as house perfumer after this work."

This perfume has been my light-hearted-mood- uplifting scent that I would spritz on in the mornings to wake up my tired mind and go to work.
It is an aromatic ”perfume”. I love the prominent cypress note in the opening. It is very fresh and clean,
Fun-fact: When I bought it I actually wanted to buy Jo Malone Wood Sage and Seasalt but abstained from doing so due to its’ bad lastingpower.
This one does NOT last much longer! You spritz it on and then after 1 hour it is basically gone.
I won’t repurchase it for now but might in a few years after finishing my Rosabotanica by Balenciaga which is a stronger more rose based interpretation of the same type of scent."

Lovely green fragrance that is great for spring/summer.
I must admit I´ve never been a great fan of Hermes as I found their colognes often lacking in both longevity and projection but I sincerely hope they´ll never stop producing this one ♥"

On my skin it starts with a very fresh cedar and fig and gentle white floral that dries down green and fresh and woody. It's a happy, lovely summer scent. Definitely for day time wear.

I'm not normally a fan of woody scents, but this one works well and is well balanced with bergamot and orange blossoms. A bit like walking through an orchard.

This is an enchanted forest smell. The opening is a bit spicy (probably the citrus mixing with the woody base notes) but once this dies down it transforms in a wonderfully balanced sweet woodsy smell. This sweetness of the scent is definitely activated the longer it sits on this skin. It truly provides a whole experience as it unravels and twists and turns.

My boyfriend does not love this one however, I think it is just too ""weird"" for him. Perhaps it is the slight bitterness of the woodsy notes. I don't care at all though, I am addicted!"
Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']","Such an interesting experience for me as Ihave nothing like this in my collection. I stumbled upon this and Apres la Mousson on sale and bought them both. I was intrigued by the challenge as I was always fascinated by women wearing these type of scents and usually caught myself thinking I could never pull them off myself. I almost feel like an imposer wearing this, but I enjoy the olfactive experience and absolutely concur that this is a great scent. Absolutely no sweetness and very well composed. No regrets about my purchase!

I accidently layered this with I am Juicy Couture. Don't shoot me, the pairing was actually lovely. I might not be able to pull off Mediterranee on it's own very often (such a short summer here in Norway), but I am so in love with the herbal vanilla in 1899 Hemingway (esp the juniper) that layering is a great option for me. Rain is pouring and I tried it layered with cologne of the missions today and yum! I know I am messing with the intent and realness of this scent and I am sorry guys, but ut sure works wonders when layered too 😉"

This is fabulous. The notes in this are just the type of fragrance that you really need to feel cool, calm, and collected in the hotter summer months. A vacation in a bottle! This fragrance is fresh, calming, oceanic. It does not have the typical warmer more sensuous vanilla and amber vibe-- or floral vibe that I'm normally drawn to. I'm normally drawn to more ""cozy"" fragrances, notes that make you want to curl up with a good book, or your honey. The notes in this are expansive, like an ocean breeze. This is in a fragrance tribe all to its own.

Others have mentioned this too, a light grassy-ness quality to it. This is a slight chemical smell which resembles Estee Lauder's White Linen, the original Chloe, Woman by Ralph Lauren -- these all cause a physical reaction, a symptom where there's a slight scratchiness in the back of my throat, wheezing (it could be me, I'm very sensitive, grew up with allergies and asthma, so therefore -- I really have to watch over doing it). Due to this particular blend of chemistry, I have to watch this and make sure that I don't spray too much of it, or in a room which doesn't have good ventilation. This is potent, a little bit of this will go a LONG WAY! Other people who are sensitive to this may be more prone to avoid you. This is definitely something to watch if you are in closed spaces or in meetings, at the theater, at school, etc...


However, the blend of this perfume is lovely!
I love this, truly I do!"

Remembering on a wonderful holiday on Mallorca, surrounded with nothing else als fig smelling bush (however it's been an other plant).
I set it aside for a longer while from some personal reasons but never taken out from my fav's list. Now I use it very often again and ask myself how was I able to go without this during the hot summer days for many years.
The liquid in my bottle is much more darker than at the beginning but it has no impact on the quality of the scent.
Perfect longevity and sillage."

It’s this dirty, wet, grassy note that is very off putting. But... BUT I let it settle on my skin for about 10 mins and now it’s starting to come together. There is still this green note that lingers in the background but that’s the point right, i mean the perfume’s name is Un Jardin. This is appropriate for the spring and summer imo. It puts me in the mindset of a boujie yet down to earth auntie. She has a lot of money and shows up to all the cookouts on time but she’ll still kick your a** in a game of spades lol

A few others have called this scent a rollercoaster and I completely agree. At times it moves dramatically, much like a pronounced peak or valley on a rollercoaster. Other times, and most impressively for me, it seems to oscillate ever so slightly - swaying or maybe just vibrating - between two related but unique moments. It reminds me of how heat undulates over hot asphalt in the summer.

The only thing that stops me from buying a full bottle of this is that about 10-15 minutes in, something emerges that is very much like stale cigarette. It’s strange, and I have no idea what I’m perceiving that gives this impression. It will fade, and as I mentioned above, ripple in and out for the duration of the scent. This is another great tragedy of this scent; it doesn't last nearly long enough. Overspraying will prolong it, but it also amps up the power of each individual note quite a bit. This can make perceiving subtler nuances for this one difficult; some of the undulating between notes fades.

All in all, a fascinating and impressive scent, but worth testing on your skin first. Even if you don't plan to buy a bottle, all fragrance lovers should just this a try just to experience the whirling, twirling, Mediterranean joy ride that this one is."

I judge the formula very weak too, if only it was stronger and stayed longer, this would be my favourite scent of all times. Im so disappointed my skin eats this out in less than 1 hour, they could reformulate this one with a better and extract-like fixative, resinous or animal one.

I can smell this on my self all day long when sprayed on the inner elbow. I have currently been wearing this perfume for 9 hours and it is still noticeable at a 2 foot distance from me. Note, that I have only sprayed 1 big spray on each elbow and a spritz behind the ears.

Every now and then, I come across a fragrance that totally mesmerizes me because I have very hard time deciphering the notes throughout its various stages of evolution.

Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès, created by master French perfumer Jean-Claude Ellenais, is most definitely one of them.

Although the notes breakdown on Fragrantica mentions it as woody aromatic, but let me assure you that this is a real understatement. This one is a real roller coaster experience with multiple levels and layers of notes from fruity fig to herbal pine to citrus and the show goes on and on.. And then when you finally sattle on a definite note, a fresh whiff of sweetness hits you every now and then, completely taking you by surprise and you are back to square one of your olfactory journey..

Performance is solid 6 to 8 hrs with 4 to 5 sprays and excellent silage..

In fact, I like Babylon even better than UJEM. And that's saying something. Babylon stays better and has a richer feel. Granted I may not be the most sophisticated nose on the block; but, to me, Babylon is bang-on. Babylon matches UJEM's notes almost verbatim. I think Babylon's creator, Hany Hafez at Alexandria, is a genius. More accessible price point than UJEM. Great value (unless for some reason you have to have Hermes).

Even though UJEM is classified as floral aquatic, I detect something slightly sweet in it. Maybe this is attributable to the fig (leaf) note. Not nearly as sweet as a gourmand or any of the fruity sugar bombs out there, though. Just a hint of sweetness. It serves to make this fresh, green, summery beauty all the more interesting and complex. I fell hard for this one, Luca Turin review notwithstanding! Pity UJEM has so little staying power..

One of the most complex and multi layered fragrances I have smelled so far.

It starts with a big blast of fig leaf and cypress. So astringent and bitter... I was not blown away with the opening and disappointed at first.

After 10 minutes the acidity is curbed and now floral notes come to stage. So realistic, nostalgic, Mediterranean. It brings me to the springs I enjoyed during my childhood in the west coast of Turkey.

The floral notes live on quite a while, together with fig leaves. Totally unisex, totally natural. For me this is the ultimate smell of spring, innocence and freedom.

After trying all the Jardin line, this is kind of most dried in the family, it open with strong “fig leaf” not fresh not watery, but dry... sometimes it reminded me of real dry tobacco leafs, it naturally smell of fig leafs (very very natural), surround by “Jardin’s DNA” that’s green, spice and crisp. When the concept is Méditerranée I always imagine about “sea note” in it but no, there’s no sea note, or salty in this fragrance. This fragrance doesn’t change so much from open to dry down... it keep as fig leafs and green and stay that way.

The fragrance is beautiful and perfectly encapsulates summer or early autumn in the rural Mediterranean (I should know, as I am from there!)

The fig is intensely green, crisp, fresh and uplifting, and the bergamot perfectly accompanies it. The other notes listed don't really register for me, but they might just add more 'depth' to the fragrance. It's very naturalistic and evocative. It really does smell like home.

It also, to my surprise, smells almost exactly like Acqua di Parma's Fico di Amalfi, but it's noticeably cheaper. So here's your pro tip for the day!

Just like Fico, though, it's plagued by soft silage and very little longevity. It's gone within the hour, even on a cold day - I'll assume that on a hot one it would evaporate almost immediately. Beautiful and I'd definitely buy it for significantly cheaper, but not for its real price.

For me I'd prefer this to Diptyque, but it's just a matter of preference. Diptyque is more refined, comes only in 75ml flacon edp, hence it's more pricey. This one is an edt in a 100ml flacon and can be bought at half the price of Diptyque.

Sur Le Toit has rose, which doesn't work with my skin.

Monsieur Li and Sur Le Nil are too heavy on the citrus for my taste and so is Mousson while also being too spicy and masculine for me.

But Méditerranée does everything perfectly. It manages the fine balancing act between feminine and masculine magnificently, just like it does with its spices, its citrus and its florals.

It's mostly a fresh spicy scent to me, somewhere in the drydown a very understated, gorgeous floral comes in and the citrus (and again, I hate citrus) is really just a slight complementary note all the way in the background.

This reminds me of warm summer evenings along the Mediterranean or Adriatic. It creates such a vivid image, which is something that I adore in fragrances.

This is absolutely perfect for hot, dry days.

On a negative note I have to mention that while its longevity is very good, its sillage is modest at best; something that holds true for most of the Jardin line.

This fragrance in particular is like a wonderful vacation. Less fruity cocktail drink by the pool and more time spent in the outdoors, lakes, rivers. Green fig leaf is pretty irresistible to me, but the cypress really makes me think of standing amongst some big wonderful tress in the hot sun.

For reference, this scent is VERY similar to Rosabotanica, but also to the much more affordable, lesser known CO Bigelow Cashmere Fig. A more distant but still identifiable relative is the Banana Republic 79."

Opens with a green fig and woody note that is wonderful. After the initial spray it takes about 10 minutes on me to hit it's stride and develop into a rich fig/woody scent that isn't sweet. Drydown is the longest yet best part of this frag. Could be worn in pretty much any occasion.

Sillage is moderate, but longevity is more than average. After spraying this on my hand at night, the scent was still on my skin after waking up in the morning.

This is my second favorite of the Hermes Jardin fragrances by Ellena, just behind 'Sur le Nil. My favorite fig based fragrance.

I'm wearing it today, and on a whim I layered it on top of Guerlain Vetiver, and am LOVING IT! The fig/woodiness of UJEM compliments and tones down the spicy Vetiver, making a more complex and interesting mixture.

My rating of fig-based fragrances are as follows with my impression of them:

1- Jardin in Mediterranee by Hermes: Fantastic natural fig/woody fragrance with 6-8 hour longevity

2- Noble Fig by Ferrari: green fig/sage with decent longevity and minimal sillage

3- Fico de Amalfi by Acqua di Parma: light fig/citrus blend. Summer fragrance with minimal sillage and longevity

4- Figuier Ardent by Atelier Cologne: sweet/green fig with milky citrus. Sillage and Longevity are moderate/good

5- Ninfeo Mio by Annick Goutal: very green leaf/ivy/citrus scent where the fig takes a while to emerge. Decent sillage/longevity.

6- Zegna Milan by Ermenegildo Zegna: Simple fig mixed with Iso E Super. Lasts a while and sillage is moderate"

I love a fig note but this one just smells a bit weird. I get more dirt and the smell of tar after it rains. Figs do have a strong earthy smell, but this one really capitalizes on that. I also get a lot of green in the opening, which I'm not a huge fan of mixed with the earth, and a strong cardamom thing going on. I'd have liked something sweeter at the top to temper the weird.

Finally, it dries down into a gorgeous, fruity-fig with a clean but never soapy floral-ish note. This dry down is heavenly and makes me imagine wearing Blue-striped linen in a Hamptons house, tan and worry-free. It's so beautiful!

I'd say because of the top notes (which last a while) it's more for a man because it's too unfeminine (but still not overtly masculine). It's weird but definitely worth a sniff. This lasts the longest out of the Jardin scents and smells very sophisticated."

The perfume evaporates too quickly in the summer heat. I bought this because of the fig accord, but must confess that I prefer the Fico di Amalfi (Aqua di Parma) to this one. Letting go a little of the unisex scents, the winner of the fig category for me is the oh so modest Eau soleil by Biotherm.
Still, this is my favourite of the ""jardins"" series by Hermes."
Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']","A slightly woody floral with a southern european feel.

Fig tree, cedar and mastic tree blending with orange blossom, grass, bergamot and white musk. The fig note is not as creamy as usually found (i.e. in Philosykos) but more of a ""green"" fig. It's unisex but leaning slightly feminine, fresh, green and quite natural. A little sweet and a little sour, but the fig is still the main player here. I find it quite light (as with others of the Hermes Jardin line) but again, this makes a great scent for smaller spaces like airplane flights, as it's quite subtle and not overpowering. Projection dies down after a couple of hours and it becomes a skinscent. Very peaceful, casual and calming. Unfortunately, my GF found this scent to have a slight ""urine"" vibe when I wear it, so the bottle ultimately had to go.

BTW, am I the only one, who's reminded of the smell of a greenhouse with this one?"

Definitely dries down to a whafting cedar wood but the fig is still there too. I very much like how dry this is - no sweetness that I find ruins fig frag.

I get mainly fig and cedar with a just a smidge of soft musky floral and even less citrus. At a loss for the pustachio, but I do get a tomato steam / fresh green garden vibe. More green than milky notes compared to other fig frags. I love the whole Hermes Jardin line and this is my new favourite I think. Lasts 8hr on me

Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']","There is a beautiful feeling in this Jean Claude Ellena creation, and it's as if suddenly all the receptors in my nostrils flared in an organic, capillary way to become branches, leaves opening up to the citrusy chlorophyll fed to them by Un Jardin En Mediterranee. On the evening I tried it, I had on my other wrist Ck One, which I also reviewed here on Fragrantica. CkOne is also supposed to be fresh, and is definitely well made, but a complete different beast from UJeM. One shouts, the other one purrs, whispers.

What Un Jardin En Mediterranee embodies, is what Jean Claude Ellena tried (and succeeded) to do in his most recent creations, as recounted by his diary book published a few years ago: he tried to leave a blank space in the perfume, to leave something unsaid, that can be filled by our brain or our nose . A bit like the human instinct of filling in visual gaps in images which we perceive as whole because our brain joins the dots and gaps that our eye doesn't find.

Like a sentence written with a broken typewriter, which we still read despite the words missing letters here and there, this perfume leaves something unsaid and guessed at the same time.

Perhaps it's the white sap of the figs, here complete with the leaves and juiciness/freshness of the fruit. We imagine it smarting on our tongue and causing our lips to stick together while eating the fig. Or maybe it's the sun over the gold wheat at the corners of the garden, missing but implied in every Mediterranean green space.

Whatever it is, this is a story that keeps evolving and a perfume which you will keep spraying until it is said more clearly. That, and the sillage being small, makes for a hushed tone, beloved of Ellena and definitely achieving that poetry which he so often seeks in perfume form."

I have never seen real, true Sicilian limoncello so beautifully represented like it is in this perfume. Un Jardin En Mediterranée does what its name promises : a walk along a beautiful Sicilian garden, smelling the sea breeze right after you squeezed some lemons... It's like drinking limoncello and taking a walk on the beach at night - a serene, magical walk that takes you to a time where things used to be easier and romantic.

It's not a blah, boring citric perfume. No, in here, you're captured by a beautiful Sicilian lemon scent in all its power and strength, but it's delicate and captivating thanks to its floral mid notes that give it warmth and coziness.

Its citric notes are therapeutic to me somehow - they're so soothing I usually wear this right after taking a shower before I go to bed. It's like wrapping yourself in a beautiful mediterranean dream... Hermés was spot on with this one!"

I smelled them first time at a department store here in Jakarta with the usual uber-cold air-conditioner, it didn't project and longevity is minimum.

It works wonders, I just take a deep breath from my wrist and feel at peace for a while.

I think it must be the fig leaf and the rest of the base notes. Even though we don't have fig or cedar trees in Finland, I think about the woods in here when I smell the perfume. (We have a lot of pine trees, and of course junipers, so it's not that much a long shot!) Forest always calms me, and in Jardin Mediterranee I detect that dry and warm feeling of it.

It is ideal for summer and warm temperatures. It is a true spring in the bottle. So aromatic herbal and fresh with slight spicy accords. I would never discover the pyramid without viewing it first. I would say there are green tee leaves, mente, basil, bergamot and some spices like black paper. But the only note mentioned in common is bergamot, no pepper at all. This spicy note should come from juniper or red cedar and should be associated to woody notes mentioned in main accords. It is not sweet at all but surprisingly aromatic and green without being sharp. I can understand why it is unisex but I just adore it and think it is more suitable for women than men.

In this perfume, fig is the dominant note in pyramidal scent. Fig lovers should test this perfume. As you can see in the pyramid scent, fig is the base note, but whatever you see is that fig is detectable from start point. Mr. Ellena mixed fig with cypress so good. If you tested L'Abre de la Connainssance, by Jovoy Paris, you detect a smell like stainless color when it doesn't dry. But the scent of fig in this perfume is so better.

As time has passed, the Hermes has gotten a bit grassier, less citrus, but the resemblance is undeniable. The bottom notes are different than in 4711, yet the top and middle are the same, and that seems to be where my nose stays. Since 4711 is one of my all time favorites, of course, I love this.

As you spray this perfume you smell citrusy fig with a green background and this will stay like this for an 30 minutes and then you see floral note kicking in and now fig is sweet which is combination of pistachio and musk. Thing to note here is that fig in this is not just the fruit part however it's the whole tree with it leaf and roots which is been blended quite well . In whole this is a very easy fragrance to wear and you can see the touch of jean claude ellena magic in this perfume however all is not honky dory with this perfume

My issue with this perfume is two fold one is that it does not last beyond 6 hours and projection is quite subtle I would have preferred more specially considering it cost around 130$ for 100 ML which is not justified however good part is that this is quite easily available at discounters so you can get it for half the retails .

I have extensively tested original Hermes un jardin line and in my opinion this is second best from the line after un jardin sur le toit which is another fantastic fragrance .

This is a gloriously salty musk. The opening is a wonderful herbal burst of Fig and evergreens with a hint of floral. It is beachy and breathtaking, like a more complex wood sage and sea salt.

As it settles the green disappears and a soapy floral mixes with the saltiness. An hour in like there might be some of the lily of the valley that blooms on my skin in many ozonic fragrances. It doesn't seem to bother me after a while though.

I was looking for a green garden scent for fall and this is going straight into the summer pile. If I hadn't just ordered my main scent for the next season I may have had a delemma.

I do not get anything floral, aquatic, sweet, or citrus on my skin. The only way it could be aquatic is if you meant rotting seaweed on the beach.

It opens to vinegar drenched woods. The acid is palpable. If it is not pickling vinegar with bitter herbs, it is a tomato based dish or overripe vegetables rotting in the sun. After an hour it briefly dries down to fig leaf before becoming a peppery fig leaf with woods in the background. This is not a feminine or unisex scent on me at all.

This is a very hot scent. I believe it made me feel even warmer on our hot, humid day. In the heat I need a fragrance that compliments it or is cooling, not a scent that makes it WORSE.

Un Jardin En Mediterranee has so much depth! The opening is so unique and quite frankly draws you in. You'll literally pause after spraying to take in the fig leaf, cedar and juniper waltz that occurs in the first ten minutes. The citrus is present in this scent but ever so lightly. When the florals kick in we get another layer of richness. The oleander is opulent and when juxtaposed with the orange and the citrus, just sings. The orange blossom is the bridge to the sweet pistachio and musk base, its all so beautiful and elegant and very Hermes! This scent is clearly unisex and it is a very green quality that makes it so. UJEM veers in so many directions scent wise. One whiff and you get fig leaf, another whiff later and it is oleander. After a few minutes you may take in a rich cedar and juniper and then a few minutes later citrus, musk and pistachio. My point is there is a progression with this scent, but it is not predictable and very green and in line with its name ... a garden, but a garden in mid spring and in full bloom. This scent has sentimental value to me. UJEM transports me to the mediterranean maghreb, more specifically my mother in law's garden. It is filled with vervain, a lemon tree and of course a fig tree. This scent encapsulates her garden beautifully. Like I said, this is unisex, but the musk and cedar give it a more masculine vibe, but that means nothing because my wife steals this scent from me regularly in spring. UJEM is perfect for spring days, and should be worn when you are meeting an old friend that you haven't seen in a while over tea and preferably in an outdoor venue."

Cool, green, aromatic and aloof. Dressed all in white and sipping a cool drink somewhere in a marvelous restaurant in Portugal (or wherever really).

I also agree with nero77 below. I've read CB book about the creation of SJP Lovely and Un Jardin Sur Le Nil and it made me explore the rest of the range. So well crafted and different. I'm not a snob when it comes to fragrance but this screams quality and class. On me the citrus notes, cypress and fig leave are the most dominant ones. A few hours in the pistachio lends a creamy touch and a tad sweetness. At least that's what I assume. I could bathe in this, really. Huge thank you again to my swap partner!"
Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']","The scent of green figs...

Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of the Un Jardin series of fragrances. I love the work of Jean-Claude Ellena and find that his work is nothing short of superb in every aspect. I had been wanting to try this perfume for a long time.

Finally, I've been wearing it recently and have enjoyed it. My initial preconception was that it would be a sweet, juicy fig type of scent, much like Acqua di Parma - Blu Mediterraneo: Fico di Amalfi, however here is a green figgy scent which is more in keeping with the same style as Un Jardin Sur le Nil, another green fragrance. I must say that as a fig perfume, I do prefer the Acqua di parma version. However this one does make me feel that if you didn't like Sur le Nil (ie you found it ""too green"") then you woudl like this instead.

Overall, this is well worth a try in my opinion, if you like fresh, spring & summer fragrances with substance. A masterful effort from Jean-Claude Ellena."

It reminds me of gardening, I get a very strong impression of tomato plant (not the fruit) but I believe that may be the fig leaf as other reviewers have stated.

Wow, this thing makes me want to cry with joy.

I don't know why, this is a surreal summer scent a la Calvin Klein, but with tons more depth and I guess it reminds me some perfect summer day where I and my beloved girl were lost in a summer city where everything is green, everything in bloom. Quite honestly, I can't even tell if that memory is real, but that's what this fragrance brings to mind.

Absolutely mind-blowing.

*** After wearing this for a while, I find it has average projection and longevity, has a bit of a sweet vibe to it that I did not notice at start, but is still such a great pleasure to smell. It's 100% feminine, I don't see how a man could wear this."

I loved that smell in my teens. It was this intense, indescribable spice unlike anything else I could find. I still have a small bottle of fragrance oil that I must have had for over 10 years.

There's a spice note in Un Jardin En Mediterranee that is reminiscent of that for me. It's much cleaner, and very fresh. The aquatic and green notes are there, but along with them is that intoxicating spice. Trees, lush foliage, fresh air, and a nearby coast line all come to mind. It really does make me think of walking along the Mediterranean. There is nothing synthetic about this fragrance, and I am incredibly impressed. I definitely smell the fig leaf and cypress. Clean, sophisticated, lush, and green. There is something ethereal and living to this smell.

I was so blown away after receiving a tester of this, that I was convinced to blind buy a bottle of lotion in the Un Jardin Apres la Mousson fragrance, as I've been looking for a cardamom fragrance and Jean-Claude Ellena has thoroughly impressed me with his mastery in creating perfumes."

All I want to say is ""Natural"". It has a nature aura, very natural, bitter and green just like a garden or forest. No synthetics, no artificial. I am so much fond of natural smelling perfumes. This one stands on top. So much relaxing, soothing. Reminds me of a walk in a garden and sea shore. Its a tranquilizer."

This one has the most dominant bitter green fig leaf note, which is very nice and refreshing. Caligna highlights the milky fig fruit, Ninfeo Mio, is citrus dominant, Fico di Amalfi has the best balance of green fig, fig fruit and citrus.
I thought I smelled something synthetic, but it may be the white nerium flower which has a talcum like smell that I never smelled befor.

The opening blast is the best, it is dry with a small bit of sweetness. You get that stark green fig leaf. I love natural, earthy green fragrances, and that fig leaf is wonderfull. It's rather sharp in a fresh way in the opening, with the coniferous notes and citruses. It is a bit woody, the floral note, which is powdery sweet balances the bitterness of the fig leaf.

Update: I'm liking this a lot more. I think this will eventually replace my Ninfeo Mio, and Fico di Amalfi, which are shy and soft with there fig notes. Hermes Mediterranee, the fig leaf is strong and sharp makes a beutifull accord with the fresh aromatic juniper and cypress, and well blended citrus.

PS: My favorite and most natural fig fragrance has become Diptyque Philosykos.

I was sniffing some fragrances and i decided to go on the women section to see if they had the ""un jardin"" line. I like ""un jardin sur le Nil"" but for me it's not that masculine and i found it too sweet for my taste, but i like the scent. So i found this one and i tried. Man, the blast of citrus on the top punched me in the face and after 10 seconds, the fig leaf and cypress apeared like a storm and wowed me. Made me smile, seriously. Man, i love fig and the only fig based fragrance that i tried was Womanity but i didn't dig it. This just makes me feel good, happy and complete. I'll buy it as soon as i can. Great scent.

It is not just a ""smell"", but feelings, memories and pictures caught in a bottle. When you spray it you open a little box of joy of summer on the seaside.
Fig leaf and woody notes are prominent surely. It is spicey, but not like peppery, but like rosemary and laurel. Really when you walk along the shore and crumbling rosemary in your hands.

وقتی رو پوستت عطر رو اسپری میکنی بوی بسیار طبیعی برگ انجیر رو احساس خواهید کرد که طی چند ثانیه رایحه برگ درخت کاج هم باهاش ترکیب میشه و رایحه بسیار لذت بخشی رو ایجاد میکنه

این عطر منو میبره به یک رویای زیبا

روی یه قایق چوبی وسط یه رودخونه باریک ، وسط جنگل
همه اطراف این رودخونه رو درخت و چمن و کلی پوشش گیاهی دربرگرفته . بیشتر درخت ها انجیر و کاج هستند و بوشون همه جای رودخونه رو گرفتن

نورخورشید از لابه لایه شاخه ها میتابه به رودخونه

با قایقت خیلی آروم داری روی آب حرکت میکنی که بعد از مدتی هوس لیموترشی که تو کیفت هست رو میکنی . پارو رو رها میکنی و لیموترش تازت رو از کیفت برمیداری ولی یادت میوفته که چاقوت همراهت نیست پس وقتی گاز میزنی همون طور که مزه تلخ و ترش رو میچشی ، بوی ترش و باطراوت لیمو همراه تلخی پوستش که گاز زدی رو حس میکنی

همین طور که داری لیموترشت رو نوش جان میکنی ، چون تو راهی که داری میری به دریا هم نزدیکی ، یکم بوی شور نمک دریا رو هم حس میکنی

بعد از تمام کردن لیموترش پارو رو برمیداری و به سمت باغ نارنگی که بیرون جنگله و کم کم داری بهش نزدیک میشی پارو میزنی و کم کم رایحه غالب برگ انجیر که از اول راه همراهیت میکرد ضعیف تر و ضعیفتر میشه. تا اینکه به باغ زیبای نارنگی میرسی و بوی نیمه شیرین نارنگی ها و بوی ضعیفی از باغچه گلی که کنار خونت داری رو احساس میکنی
---------------------------------------------------------------
بعد از 1 ساعت بوی نارنگی رو با بوی ضعیف گلی متوجه خواهید شد و بعد از 1 ساعت دیگه بوی خیلی ضعیف نارنگی همراه بوی مشخص مشک و کمی هم بوی گلی این عطر فوق العاده رو به پایان میرسونن

طول عمر عطر حدود 4 ساعت و پخشش 2 تا 1 ساعت خوب و بعد از اون ضعیفتر میشه

ولی پخش و ماندگاریش به هیج وجه برام ارزش نداره

هروقت غمگین هستید از این عطر استفاده کنید چون وقتی بوش میکنی ناگهان احساس خوشحالی بهت دست میده"

On my skin, this is a fairly linear green scent done the pleasingly transparent, overtly spare, modernist style of Jean-Claude Ellena. Nice, unisex, neutral and unlikely to offend, but also similarly unlikely to inspire."
Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']","Opens quite spicy, a bit bitter, that quickly turns into a sweet green sweetish mix. I smell fig leaf, bergamot and then a hint of fir and juniper appears creating a certain freshness. Lastly, a very light musk appears. The drydown is a sweet but still fresh and green mix, with a balmy feel to it, on a base of cedar.

Sillage is moderate, longevity moderate.

A fresh scent for spring or summer. A happy scent that reeks of freedom. Unisex due to the sweetness and the cedar/greens. I don't really like the balminess, that's not really my thing and occasionally the fir/cypress notes get stronger and a little bit acrid. Then it changes back to sweet fig leaves, very refreshing.

Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']","I have two Un Jardin fragrances, this one and Sur la Nil. Both are very good. Some merits to this one:

Hermes is very good at making a light, airy fragrance that lasts and lasts but never loses its gossamer appeal. If you like the scent of flowers on fresh breezes, in between earth and sea air, you'll love pretty much any of its fragrances.

This one has a distinctly sunny, fruited tree grove on maybe a craggy cliff overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. You get a little trees (apparently that's cypress and juniper but to me it just smells rather sunny and scrubby), you get a bit of floral (perhaps the orange blossom, though whatever it is isn't distinctly orangy) and a whole lot of tree fruits. Some may even say tomato plant. But I say it's fig tree. I really hesitate to say ""oh it smells of fig leaf"" since I've had fig plants and the leaves never smelled. I think honestly it's fig fruits, which are sweet and succulent and woodsy themselves.

But I don't sniff this and say right on, I get this or that particular note. I think it's really a garden, including the fruit, plants, earth, sun, air, wind and light all kind of giving you a dapply sense of a bunch of things going on. You're not going to smell of fig jam or bubblegum with this.

I do get a really bright summer garden image as well, perhaps tomatoes, zucchini and giant pumpkin blossoms, maybe some bees and flies and more sunlight. The colors would be green, blue and maybe even bright green/yellow/orange and glossy brown or green fruit.

Both the Un Jardin frags I have really do transport you. I liked reading the stories of what places these folks had been to, and how it reminded them of Tunisia, Italy, etc. (all on the coastline of the Sea) and the Egyptian who discussed Un Jardin sur la Nil.

This fragrances is no exception to the above. Reading below, each person's review had a bit of travel guide in it, which is fun, and I really do feel for me, I don't get to travel but I can mentally travel when I wear this. I think for that reason, this must have truly hit the mark the designer intended. I think I may like sur la Nil a bit better overall for me, but I definitely think this is masterful work."
Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']","Un Jardin En Mediterranee is a very elegant and ladylike perfume for the summer; and unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend it for people who have trouble with citrus, green accords and their skin.

On my skin, this opens with a burst of fig leaf, which really is very refreshing and green, and I was enjoying this paired with the woodsiness... until my chemistry just turned the green and citrus accords to soap. It really is a lovely soap that's very refined and subtle, and I do sense that the notes used are of a good quality; however, my skin does have a tendency to draw out the synthetic nature of these particular notes, so this also smelt quite synthetic on me.

Overall, it's not my favourite from the Jardin series because it wasn't really what I was looking for. Sillage is soft; lasts for about 4-5 hours."
Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']","Fruity and floral, with grapefruit as the main note to start with more of a figgy sweetness in the dry down, UJEM fits, as other reviewers have said, into several genres: sweet, fruity, floral, woodsy. And in that respect, it's versatile, but it does not impress, project, or last, at least not to me. It is certainly a spring and summer day scent, primarily, and does speak to the outdoors in its fruity/floral/woodsy balance.

Longevity is a little disappointing, as it's a skin scent within the hour and lasts only maybe six hours after that (as a skin scent). And while it's described as unisex, it leans toward the feminine side on my skin, and this isn't surprising since many shops list this as a women's perfume.

Not for me but worth smelling if you're looking for something off the beaten path and contrasting most summer aquatics.

Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']","This is my favourite fragrance from the Jardin series. It has the right balance between sweet, bitter and floral. As a fragrance aiming at the Mediterranean, it strikes the right balance among herbs-fig-florals. There is always the risk of being too heavily sweet or floral, but it succeeds in maintaining a bitter-fresh smell, perhaps due to the fig note.

It is my favourite fragrance when going to the beach, even here in the tropics. It works wonders in the hot climate and never becomes cloying. Love it!"
Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']","To me the whole Jardin series is an exercise in cut vegetation and spice. In evey Jardin fragrance but especially in this one - fresh wet celery and clear plastic hum throughout.

It is absolutely contemporary and 'transparent'. BUT, at a distance this fragrance takes on a different character all together. When I'm writing I always have the urge to put my nose right up to where I applied the fragrance. I am thinking this is not the way these Jardin fragrances were intended to be experienced.

When you sniff Mediterranee around a foot away it is so much more natural, humid & floral. The celery is barely noticeable and the vegetable notes blend and become moist and less supermarket sterile. It manages to capture some of that pungent vegetation and spice reminiscent of an open window alleyway in a salty seaside village in the evening before dinner time. The florals really come alive and the spices wafting through the windows mix to create something unique to place.

I was so happy to smell this on a friend yesterday and it just taught me that I don't have to bury my nose in a fragrance to really appreciate it. This one is best at a distance and tells an interesting story if you don't get too close."
Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']","You don't need to book a holiday when you can buy this. For me, many fragrances embody a certain time, situation or place, this one has all of them at once.

It reminds me of my times in the Mediterranean. The moist, fresh fig leaf element is in the garden in the morning, when you've watered the plants and droplets form on the fig leaf. Later that day as it becomes scorchingly hot you find yourself walking down towards the sea through the woods. The smell of the woods are lifted by the fresh salty sea breeze that brushes gently through the branches. You know it's the middle of summer but the soothing air is there to cool you down. By now youre thirsty from your leisurely stroll, so you sit down and gulp down a refreshingly juicy orange, lime, basil and lemon drink that's been freshly squeezed from fruits just picked nearby, their rinds have been rubbed along the rim of the glass,, no ice, it's just ice cold. It quenches your thirst.

Not many fragrances have made me see colours or taste something. But this one made me see a dark green that was juicy and quenched my thirst along with a very rich deep azure blue. It will no doubt be my summer fragrance.

It's certainly woody, but it's certainly aquatic too. There is a floral note but it's by no means a floral fragrance. I'd like to know if others get the salty sea air note as much as I do or whether this just reminds me of the Med so much that I assosciate it with that back of the throat sea salt note.

Truly impressed!"

Smells earthy green, aquatic, exotic, and a little unusual. I think this is much more green-aqautic than floral-aquatic. There's little to nothing floral to the nose here.
How odd. I love it and I don't even know why.
This is the best fig as far as I know, especially given that it doesn't have a coconutty accord that so many of them tend to have, such as Philosykos.

Not sure if they changed something about the formulation, but now all I get is a huge hit of unpleasant harshness up front that I just can't deal with.

I can see that the top notes might not be pleasing to some, but I find them to be unusual in a good way. This is very green with woody notes as it warms, I find it to be more herbal than aquatic, at least on me. I don't think it will replace eau d'orange vert as my favorite Hermes fragrance, but think it may run a close second."
Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']","I really enjoy Hermès because they have created a fine fragrance with unquie aroma's covering a wide range. I have fair size collection's to name a few Rocbar, Bel Ami and last Terre D' Hermès perfect as fall/winter fragrance. Recently I picked up Terre D Hermès eau Très Fraiche, Un Jardin Sur Le Nil and finally Un Jardin Mêditerranée.
My review on Un Jardin Mêditerranée,
Every time I wear this fragrance I feel like I'm in Italy going through a vineyard/garden. In the first 2hrs the aroma of orange blossom and lemon gives it a real zesty aromatic aroma. The main notes of fig leaf is so intense you get a green vib which lasts well past 4hrs. To balance this GEM both cypress and juniper berry gives it a hint of herbal/woodsy undertones. Floating is a floral aroma giving it a deep warm/sweet aroma.
Longevity and Silage is very high lasting well past 6hrs.
Finally thoughts,
Out of the different fragrance's from Hermès this juice can be worn from early spring throughout the summer months and till the end of fall. What's nice about this fragrance is that every time you wear it gives off a calm relaxing happy vib. I enjoy using it and several co-workers complimented me because it wasn't a heavy fragrance which has a cloying aroma. This fragrance has a delicate balance between green/earth notes topped with floral aroma. I recommend to those who know Hermès, if your not sure test first....if it's not for you I'm sure there's something else that could be substituted. Rating this fragrance 7.5/10"

The scent does not want to be with me. After the initial blast of citrus i get the drydown of juniper and fig.

Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']","Un Jardin sur le Nil was my favourite perfume for a couple of years, it was the only one I wore before I got seriously interested in perfumes, and I still love it. So when I did get the perfume craze, exploring the other Jardins was an obvious priority, and I got a sample of this mediterranean version first.
It took me several months and the whole sample to finally form an opinion, though, because I seem to react to this fragrance differently each time. Roughly though, I gradually liked it more and more. At first, there were a couple of times when I found the smell slightly nauseating. That was in spring, when it was colder and I was experiencing a lot of work-related stress, so either or both of those factors might have contributed to that. Then during the hottest summer months I wasn't drawn to it, preferring the lighter Jardin sur le Nil, which seemed to fit those hot and restless days better. But now, finally, in the cool late summer/early autumn weather we're having here, I've fallen in love with Un Jardin en Mediterranée at last.

I love the fig leaf in this; it must be my favourite note and I'd say about half of my loved scents have it. So you might think I don't need another one, but I think I do, because this is different: the other fig scents I've tried are all either sweet, brightened by dominant citrus notes, or so realistic they're almost boring. This one is none of that: it's very natural, but the combination with the cypress and the juniper works very well here for making it more complex. It's very green and quite aromatic; woody in that coniferous way that I like, beautifully balanced out by the natural milkiness of the fig leaf.
So it is lovely, but only as long as you don't overspray. That's extra important with this one, because it has a tendency to become harsh in that case.
I also think it's a bit weird that this is classified as ""aquatic floral"", because I don't smell any of either of those accords.

For me this is perfect for late spring/early autumn, so I'll be on the lookout for a small bottle."

I'm normally a fan of Tom Ford's Jasmin Rouge during the summer, but I wanted an alternative to Jasmin Rouge and this was perfect! On me it tends to change and several people have said I smell a little bit vanilla-lemony-minty (which is definitely the scientific term...) but that makes it great for hot weather, close-quarters and not wanting to overpower people if you reapply, and it's moderately long-lasting. (This also makes a great hair perfume!)"

Un Jardin Mediterranee definitely smells very much like freshly-squeezed Hermes citrus rush . That said, in lots of pizzazz.

I like this unique style of fragrance of course. No one can go wrong with being unique. It is not overpowering and not offensive, as it smells very natural.

Great for wear during the day, in the heart of summer and late spring. It does have a nice staying power when worn with your sunscreen !"
Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']","Perhaps someone more educated than I can explain what it is that makes almost all of Jean Claude Ellena's fragrances smell so very ""Jean Claude Ellena"" I suppose it's just the same way you can tell the difference between Listening to a classic 80s hit and hearing the Glee kids sing one on TV. His signature is so specific but I am not educated enough to put my finger on what it is. Anyway it's the reason why my ex used to gag and snicker ""ugh you reek of Hermes""
Unlike my ex I happen to love that ""I-don't-know-what"". It's fresh a little sour, woody, so stimulating, and unique like Stevie Nicks' voice. It doesn't matter what she sings, you know it's her and not Bonnie Tyler. The Garden Series has it, mostly everything in the Hermessence line has it, the colognes have it, and so on and so on...
Whatever it is, I like it best in THIS fragrance because I find it more consistent here than I do in the other fragrances.
Un Jardin en Mediterranee though it starts out with quite a punch is beautiful and juicy from start to finish. It fades and becomes a bit lighter with time but doesn't disappoint. I love the transition of old Guerlains. Whether they change from beginning to end they don't disappoint by turning huskily dry or sour like many of Jean Claude Ellena's creations. Un Jardin en Mediterranee changes quite subtly if at all and I appreciate that much more than say, Sur Le Nile which becomes a dry boring oriental, Osmanthe Yunnan which turns into dryish leather, or Terre which becomes peppery vetiver and sour juice. Un Jardin may not be groundbreakingly unique, but what it lacks in originality it makes up for with juicy straightforward beauty and the undeniable presence of that ""Jean Claude Ellena smell"" my ex despised. It is my favorite in the line, hands down.
So, SO perfect for the summertime in Japan."

However, with time this scent mellows a bit and starts to be pleasant. I can wear its middle and base notes. Not in my style, but acceptable."
Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']","I have a love-hate relationship with Un Jardin En Méditerranée. On good days, I'll like it enough, but on bad days, I steer clear of it like a plague.

It smelled absolutely perfect on paper, but somehow it rarely ever works well on me. It's overwhelming, dizzying and I feel like I'm being enveloped in a cloud of sea salt and sweet figs even with just a spray. This is by far the least-used perfume in my collection because of that reason.

But I can see how it works on some others. Objectively speaking, it's very charming and I remember how much I really loved it on paper: pure magic. It's intriguing. It commands you to smell it again. The best way to describe this is something that has very distinct personality. You can really love it or really despise it.

Overall, a very magical and mysterious perfume, but sadly it rarely ever works for me.

I have not smelled such a rich, complex, airy fragrance like this before. Sure, I have tried rich ambery vanilla fragrances with spices and incense, but nothing like this. The fig in this fragrances gives me a rich leathery feel almost like dried figs, and the woodiness of the juniper makes everything more robust. I am going to burn through my sample so fast that I really think I should purchase a botle within the coming days. Longevity is around 6 hours, projection is mild, but I don't care! This fragrances smells so good that I cannot dismiss it due to the performance. This is literally the first fragrance that I have smelled that put a smile on my face the second I smelled it.

Un Jardin En Mediterranee Hermès (unisex) ~ 2003,"['woody', 'aromatic', 'citrus', 'green', 'fresh spicy', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'floral', 'white floral']","I am very picky about perfumes. Even though I like a lot of them, I find there are very few I can wear without feeling ill or head-achy after a while. But I don't just want to wear citrusy smells all the time, even though those are generally safe for me.

So, I still love to order and test samples. And every once in a while, one in the lot I've sampled makes me go, ""Whoa, this is special"". It happened with Diptyque's L'ombre dans L'eau and Philosykos and Chanel's Les Exclusifs Sycomore, Bois des Iles, and No 22.

And now it's happened with Un Jardin en Mediterranee. I LOVE this. It's fresh but rich. I just get the sense of something syrupy and thick, but NOT in an overpowering way. I don't mean syrup-y like overt sweetness, but more like tree sap. Naturally sweet tree sap.

Actually, as I wore this throughout the day, I kept getting more of the woody notes, to the point I almost felt this is what a Christmas tree in the Mediterranean would smell like. Don't ask me why. It doesn't make much sense, but that's the image I kept getting.

It's sweeter than Philosykos, and to be honest, I don't know which one I like more. Philosykos is greener and sharper (EDT, haven't tried the EDP), and this has the fig smelling riper. I love both and I can see myself craving both of them on different days."

But I couldn't see myself, 21, wearing it. The smell would fit great for someone from South America or Southern Europe like Italy- somewhere warm climate with someone who has dark skin. I dunno, that was just what I thought-- just like heavy oud reminding me of people in the middle east and india, since a lot of people I know from those area would not buy any perfume that does not smell heavy.

It smelled like.... scent good for use only if I were to visit the beach, which I totally hate. And smelled like a scent good for someone 30 and up.

Last month I smelled it again...smelled too strong and yucky.

Today, I smelled it again at Hermes boutique...and I liked it! I was given paper sealed in small plastic bag so I could smell the middle and base note. I came home and after 6 hours and 12 hours later, I am smelling this and I really like it. I think in the past, I was never interested in woody scent since I never walked into any teenager or women in 20s wearing woody scent. But after roaming niche perfumeries and smelling all sorts of scents, I got used to woody scent :D:D

I know it is so odd that I initially thought the perfume was okay, but not a fit for me, then it smelled so yucky, then finally today it smelled good. But I might try it on my skin a couple times, and perhaps it does fit me."

The citruses are lovely at starters, the oleander is a new note for me but orange flowers I love.

the woods and the ffreshness of the citruses .

will make it very wearable this upcoming summer too !

Somehow it's not at all what I expected it to be and yet now I can't think how I could have thought it would be anything different. It's exactly how I would expect a Mediterranean garden to smell. It has a sort of balmy quality mixed in with the cypress, fig leaf and cedar. I haven't gotten much citrus in this wearing, though - I'll have to see if it shows up the next time I try this.

To me it's very much a unisex scent, perhaps leaning a tad towards masculine. As temporalgrace said, it's not so much a perfume as a concentrated version of the smell in a garden. I adore it, I find it very striking.

This is definitely going on my ""must buy"" list."

Warm musky vanilla then appears before settling down with the juniper and cypress. Cypress is a note that for me always immediately conjures up images of italy. It just had to be in this scent.
This scent amazingly manages to be clean, fresh, warm and deep, all at the same time. The sum of these different notes successfully recreates for me a sunny walk along the sea shore somewhere in the med. Bliss. I was also very impressed on its sillage and longevity.

This is a in your face leather scent with raspberry and florals supporting it. I love it but cannot wear this one no matter how I try.

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']",Smells like leather. Awkward. Like wearing a gourmand that smells just like Hershey's syrup. I've never liked a Tom Ford fragrance yet.
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","Nobody likes it around me when asked (have asked many times)..., but I do. People find it too offensive. I love it, and going to wear it anyway.10/10"
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","Some years have passed since I have tried a sample of this wonder for my first time. Now, I have finally decided to take the big step, and take this beauty in a full bottle.

Where to begin...
first consideration: I think reformulation and Estée Lauder acquisition took 'minor' reformulation to this beast, since I remember a very similar scent, compared to few years ago. This is the only TF I have tried by now, but I already have the sensation it could be monumental and one of the best - if not the masterpiece - of the entire Tom Ford Private Blend line.

This fragrance is quite linear and eternal - at least for 6 to 8 hours, where the breakpoint of drydown begins. It will last hours and hours, so you will have to love it, although I suspect it is hard not to love a quality product like this. Could be offensive, though.

Second (and very unusual) consideration: I don't know if it is the reaction with my skin or a recent formula, but I am quite sure the leather note is artificially re-created here. An illusion.

I can detect suede, a lot of raspberry (sweet note) and it settles in a thyme - woody background that is gorgeous during drydown, all accompanied by a pinch of saffron mixed with the omnipresent 'coke' freebase mark (maybe a little depowered, but still here in all its splendor).

An irreverent punch in the face!

The amazing thing is that these elements combined together contribute to give a raw, rugged and dry quality leather - that, in my opinion, should be a somehow 'harsh' note.

The bottle itself is a work of art, reminding a solid and strong Doric order column of ancient Greek's architecture, unveiling the vision of Mr. Tom Ford back in his glorious heydays.

Ultra masculine, fills a room and takes no prisoners. Two atomization will likely last for an entire day or even longer... God have mercy if you spray it on your dresses. A bit overpriced, but still it is one of the most wonderful lines in perfumery world (at least, it is possibly the highest end in the designers frags world).

When you smell it, you can smell success, richness, the Hollywood world, fake-plastic-surgery-rich superstars, luxury... I can figure very easily a lot of actors, models, directors in the jet set to wear this to their parties or formal events.

It is an otherworldly fragrance, a godlike perfume.

Maybe I will radically change my judgement in the future; by now, indeed, I thank Heaven made TF to dream bigger than anyone else during his times - and becoming such a visionary!

Chapeau!"

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","For some reason the raspberry note is not very pronounced on my skin. I just get strong leather, suede, resins, amber. It is very potent, It has strong projection and longevity. I can't wear it, it is too masculine. It is amazing on men.
I have MAC Ruby woo which is somewhat similar but is much more feminine (the fruity and floral notes are in the center with the leather) and I recommend it for females who enjoy leather scents."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']",Many years ago this use to have a herbal gasoline crispy leather opening that seriously reminisced pure real cocaine. This lasted for hours and the raspberry note was a lot less sweet and prominent. These days it’s still the beast it used to be but more like a jar of raspberry jam thrown over a leather jacket.
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","Super realistic leather with a hint of raspberries. In what it's trying to do, its easily 10/10. Sadly this is not my cup of tea at all. But if you like the description of the smell, you should blind buy this. And i usually dont recommend anyone to blind buy anything.

EDIT: I feel in love with this one. First try i felt like this was too much for me, a little too raw and smoky, but now i love it. The genius combination of raspberry mixed with the high-quality brand new Ferrari interior is my weak-point, i cannot wait for colder weather so i can wear this every day. Mr. Ford, hats off to you for this one, cause this will permanently stay in my collection."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","This is one of, if not the best leather centric fragrances on the market.
Opulent Leather with a hint of raspberry sweetness.
The drydown has some animalics lurking in the background to give it further depth.

Picture this: You are sitting in the interior of a brand new Ferrari while eating raspberries and petting your pet tiger cub. 🐅

Leather, Raspberries, Animalic = Tuscan Leather
Another masterpiece and a masterclass in perfumery from TF"
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","This is an enhanced Ombre leather, when it dries it gets better rather than stronger like Ombre leather. If you spray Ombre and Tuscan side by side they will last the same amount, but Ombre stops projecting faster, and has less character, pure leather. This turns the raspberry into less sweet more smokey scent. If you smell it really hard it will give you a burnt tobacco smell very deep down. It's brilliant."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","Drydown separates this from ombre leather, it gets better as it dries, unlike ombre leather imo"

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","Tuscan Leather is everything you'd expect from Tom Ford's Private Line - high quality, audacious and unapologetic. Along with Tobacco Vanille, Tuscan Leather was the first Private Line I ever smelled, and I was shocked by its boldness and depth. When you first spray it, it smells overwhelmingly like leather, like the seats of a new car or a leather jacket. Obviously, the presence of leather didn't surprise me, but having only smelled designer fragrances at that point, I guess I expected it to be combined with other accords, like in Spicebomb for example. In the opening of TL, the saffron gives the leather a spicy touch. While leather is the predominant accord throughout, as it dries down, the raspberry and amber become more prominent, giving it a little bit more fruitiness and smoothness. It's got a definitive ashiness too, almost like when you smell cigarette smoke from a distance.

As you'd expect, the projection is heavy, and the longevity is incredible. I can smell it on me after showers, and on clothing for days. Its boldness makes it more suited to evening wear, especially if you want to have an impact, and its heaviness lends itself to colder weather.

People say it's either love it or hate it, and for the majority of people, they may not like it, or at least would prefer more mainstream fragrances. It's my most expensive fragrance and definitely the least likeable by mainstream standards. However, I don't think that is to the detriment of this fragrance. There is no reason whatsoever to spend this much money on a fragrance just to smell nice to those around you - if that's what you want then buy Dior Sauvage and be done with it. The only reason to spend this much is for yourself, if you are interested in fragrance in more of the artistic sense, and want to push the boundaries further than is possible with designer fragrances.

Ombré Leather from the signature line is definitely more palatable, and if you just want to please those around you, the Signature Line is definitely a better bet, but if you're bold and want to experience something more impactful and 'out there', TL along with the rest of the Private Line is very much worth a look. Don't blind buy it, though."

Fast forward a few months and I grew to despise it! No doubt this is part and parcel of the olfactory journey.

Initially I loved that I could pick up leather and suede that is sweetened by notes of raspberry. However now all I smell is industrial gears, with industrial oil smattered across an animal's hide with a highly synthetic raspberry note that sits awkwardly on top.

Please - do not use my review as a basis to buy it or not. Go smell it yourself - many people seem to adore it! I did at the start and overtime grew to hate it. This bottle will definitely be on my shelf for many years!"

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","Tuscan Leather is not what I expected, but in a fantastically alluring way. I have heard some comparing it to the signature blend Ombré Leather (I own a bottle), but personally cannot see them comparing in any way. I really like both, but for completely different reasons and I think that they are certainly both worth having.

Perhaps somewhat strangely, I don’t get a massively strong leather note in this one. To me, Tuscan leather is an intoxicating blend of smokey, tart and sweet spices, that dries down to a gorgeous rounded out layer of suede. I reckon the name ‘Tuscan Suede’ might have suited this one more. The leather note I get from OL is much more of a dirty, badass leather jacket. This is more refined and dressed up, as if you rode your motorcycle in the day and wore OL, you would transition into TL for dinner and drinks.

A stunner of a fragrance for colder weather. I have purchased a bottle.

EDIT: I had heard that this fragrance was reformulated and the cocaine note has been toned down, so I was cautious of batch variation. The original review was based on a decanted sample that I assume came from a newer bottle. The full bottle I purchased is a discontinued 30ml size and hence an older batch and let me tell you: the older is MUCH closer to what I expected. Sharp, gasoline-like raw leather in the opening and less sweet in the base. Still, no doubt in the smoky, tart, supple suede dry down this is fantastic and unique to OL. If you really want to ‘smell like brick’ like Drake says, try to find an older bottle. I love it."

Must be sniffing fakes... They simply cannot have their noses on the real deal... or maybe they are suffering olfactory fatigue or olfactory adaptation to it?..

It is now 5:45 in the afternoon and I can still clearly smell it wafting off my inner elbow.

This is an absolute powerhouse and it actually smells better as it fades... the first hour, even with one spray, can be overpowering and quite possibly headache inducing..

I wore two sprays of it on my day off last week and nearly choked to death on it..

Burying your nose in it and smelling it up close isnt really that pleasing to the nose.. thats not to say it smells bad, its just too strong. It smells bloody nice from a foot or so away.

The cocaine smell probably comes from methyl benzoate, the smell that cocaine releases in moist air, and what drug dogs are trained to sniff out. I have heard that the newer formulations are not as cocainey (not tried the old ones).

I *love* Tuscan Leather, though. All of my favorite notes (Raspberry, Thyme, Leather and Suede) in one downright addictive tiny vial. I don't know if I would want to wear it work, as it feels explosive and impolite to other's personal space. Longevity is impressive for my skin, around 7-8 hours.

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","Here's my question (and long story) to all of you regarding this fragrance.

The first time I came across TF TL was in a Nordstrom in Toronto, a few years ago now. I knew right away that I had stumbled across something special and I'm not going to be able to add anything about the fragrance itself that hasn't already been said by all of you.

I showed my wife and if you knew my wife, you'd know she could care less about my fragrance obsession. But even she agreed that this was nice and she'd be all right with me buying it. But there it sat on Private Blend row with a Private Blend price tag. No matter, the sales woman gives me three 4ml samples to take home, so now I have 12ml's of TL anyway.

Every once in a while I'd put it on and think, I need to get this. Then one day my wife and I are back in Nordstrom and we see something called Ombre Leather from TF. We sample it, she loves it more than TL and it's $100 less. SOLD! So now I have a leather fragrance in my collection. Yay!

Then one day I'm in Sak's and the sales lady loves me (they love anyone who will talk to them about fragrances) and she shows me (and gives me) literally a bag full of Clive Christian samples. So I try on ""C"" and I think ""man... that smells familiar!""

Then I come across a guy named Alan who's trying to unload a bottle of Velvet Oud Rose from Jo Malone. I go to meet him to to potentially buy it but he brought some other frags with him, including a bottle of Oro 1920 from Bois 1920. Once again ""man... this ALSO smells familiar"" so I bought that instead of the Jo Malone.

There's no question that Tuscan Leather is the best I've smelled from this particular leather/fruit smell. Clive C is very smooth. Oro 1920 is extremely smooth, long lasting and perfectly unisex, probably the closest to Tuscan Leather. Ombre Leather is dirty, strong, has a bit more edge but underneath has that same TL scent.

And then you look at the long line of fragrances above under ""This Perfume reminds me of"" and there's currently TWENTY different ones. So then I start to think ""is TF even the original of this fragrance or did they just copy someone else?"" ""are there better ones out there I haven't even tried?'

Tom Ford is so popular and for someone like me who lives in Toronto Canada where choice is actually limited, it's easy to assume that Tuscan Leather is the gold standard for this scent but is that actually the case?

So the question I have for you is this. Is it worth it, to pay Private Blend prices for 50 ml of a fantastic fragrance when you can likely get something extremely close somewhere else for less?

Don't get me wrong, I'd love to have this in my collection but since I already own Ombre Leather which is from TF and Oro 1920 which is fantastic and even my little samples of not only Clive C but also TF Tuscan Leather, would I pay nearly $300 CDN for 50ml's of the Private Blend?

Especially knowing there are 20 other fragrances out there that smell similar?"

I spray it on my arm just to be able to sniff it.
I didn't get the raspberry at first, but then after wearing it a couple of times, l get it immediately, hiding in fresh clean suede and leather, along with some smokey vibe.

Sure, Marquis de Sade 1740 and Naomi Goodsir Cuir Velours is two great leather-scents also, but they come ""with a twist"" and thats fine - sometimes....but in the cold winter, when i just want that brown, browner, darkest leather, it´s Tom Ford i reach for.

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","To me this smells like pure, rich leather. I don't get much of any other notes except to prop up the leather and make the composition. The type of leather is new and expensive- it really reminds me of the smell of a new leather shoe. It's definitely polarizing and not for everyone, but a must try if you like the leather note. I find Ombre Leather to be a bit more mass-appealing and less polarizing, however for people wanting a pure strong leather, Tuscan Leather is where it's at."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","What more can be said about this beast that has not already been said. It polarizes, yes, for some, it is heavenly and for others the smell of a burnt out car. The fact there is no middle ground is testament to its strong character. I adore it. I don't know if enough attention is given to the summer-berry top note - perhaps Drake's cokey homage has drawn attention away from that. It reminds me starting out of the raspberry fondant filling you get in those dark chocolate creme bars from Frys. Though the insanely powerful leather/suede engine soon pulls away from the raspberry note, it never quite goes away and leaves the lingering (boy does this stuff linger) remnants silk smooth and never too basic. As for projection - only wear this to work if you are a show off, or want to impress one person in particular - hah, but even that might be a crap shoot. Finally seasonality. Possibly a bit sickly in hot weather, but absolutely perfect for ur winter wooly scarf. Yum."

Smells like a very sophisticated Leather all the way, sort of what I smell in the houses of my rich friends. Its a very good smooth scent from start to finish -- no harsh openings, no overpowering drydowns. Very nice, and its well worth the price IMO.

My only gripe with this is that it smells too close to other Leather fragrances with better prices. I feel its too close to Godolphin or even Fahrenheit for me to justify the higher price tag, even if it IS a lot smoother and more refined. Its the best of the 3, no doubt, but not by much.

Its a pretty good performer on my skin too -- lasting around 5 or 6 hours as a detectable aura. Projects really well in the first 3 hours, is always present, but is never overpowering. Overall, a classy Leather that's completely safe to blind buy, if money is not an issue."

If you're afraid of pulling the trigger on a bottle then PLEASE try a decant or sample of this scent. You will not regret it.

This baby opens up with a strong deep leather/suede with the gentle sweetness tones of raspberries underneath. After about 5 - 6 hours of fruity-leather accords, you're left with a smooth leather-suede scent throughout the dry down which lasts for a whopping 12 hours on me. I kid you not, I sprayed this on my sweater and my friends are just looking at me like ""Yo, why the hell you still wearing that scent today?!"". I'm just over here trying to explain to them it's just stuck to the sweater! Hah!

Uniqueness: 10/10 (My first spray, this BLEW MY MIND! It also turns heads, including my wife's, and she's not a big fan of leather.)
Price: 6/10 (This can be a bit tough for many people to pull the trigger on. Yes it IS expensive, since it's Tom Fords private collection. However, I swear this baby is worth EVERY penny!)
Overall: 8.5/10 (If you don't have this fragrance in your collection, I implore you to try it at least once in your life. Even if you hate leather, this may be the scent that changes your mind!)"

A dry, sweet, artificial berry gives you a bright dentist-poster smile, not natural, but effective. Heck, if one can be beautiful, who wants to be natural?

What ensues is a heavily tar-like leather (I was thinking both Suederal and Isobutyl Quinoline, but what do I know?) with a hint of high-pitched saffron (Safraleine), mixed with Tom Ford’s trade mark dry powder base, which smells half cocoa, half coke.

This composition is crafted with a lot of exclamation mark (!) in mind: very pleasant ! very straightforward !! very...in-your-face !!!

A rather linear scent, it rejects nuance, juice, or unnecessary sentiments: it is what it is.

Gotta admit, the scent is superb, hard to NOT fall in love with it, because you know It won't take no for an answer."

The opening smells like a luxurious leather jacket/bag. Then after 5 mins the sweet raspberry kicks in. The leather takes a back seat here. It is one of the most beautiful scents I've ever smelled. I couldn't stop sniffing myself. Damn that smells so freaking good. After 2 hours you can smell the smokey leather notes mixing with raspberries. It's super awesome and it might come off as a bit feminine in the first 2 hours but then it's a manly scent. This thing projects and projects off my skin. I got the 2019 batch with the old bottle? No idea. Anyway people telling this has been re-formulated or whatever have a fake one I guess.

This thing keeps projecting like the oldskool Dior Homme Parfum.

You can seriously drive women crazy with this one.

EDIT: received Ombre Leather today. OL is less sweet and it smells like a burning leather jacket instead of sweet smokey leather.

I havd them all in full bottles or original testers, so I am happy to compare herein. They all share the same backbone despite the claimed difference in note composition.

The difference between all 5 above is the performance mainly and how thick they smell. There might be a minor difference in sweet vs leather strength in each, but to me they are all replicas of each other, regardless of which one preceded the others.

Graded from strong to weak are: TS and la yuqawam, aoud leather, pure leather and oud saphir."

Suprisingly the rest development was pure sexual flirt, I never smelt anything like it. The scent makes female toes curl up. But yeah, I believe, you must be smelling like cookie to pull this perfume off. On someone with healthy pleasant natural skin scent it should be delicious.

To sum things up, it has really nice fruity tobacco and leather scent, with time it becomes perfum-y leather jacket and it has some kind of sexual atmosphere.

Super animalic leather kind of reined in with saffron and reaspberry. What sets this apart from all of its subsequent clones and inspirations is the smokiness of this fragrance. TL smolders for a while before it settles down, sort of settles down i should say.

If you are an alpha male, or at least want to portray one, this is it...This scent lasts a lifetime. It is not versatile, it is truly best in cold weather, formal. Wearing this in heat, or the office and even a SLIGHT over application would suffocate the room. You need to wear this with confidence and assertiveness in my opinion.

The fake cherry air freshener ruins it for me. He should have chosen a higher quality ingredient to represent the cherry. The leather is a new car/leather couch scent and is very strong! So strong, that one should consider mainly wear this during evenings only.

Strong, solid longevity, linear.

Ford's mind works where he wants to recreate scents that he experienced in some random extraordinary moment of his life. I can only imagine the story where this idea spawned...lol Slightly edgy. Sadly REFORMULATED with poor ingredients, no longer cocainey.
As an Italian, I love it as it's my favorite leather scent discovered to date next to Ombre Leather.
Warning! Out of 25 girls tested, not a single girl has said they like it, in fact, most are grossed out by it. I guess it's too strong of a processed newly made leather couch scent.
Sadly, this frag will be only for me to wear by myself.

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']",A very strong perfume. I am currently experimenting with leather dominant perfumes and so far my fav brand is Hermes (Eau d'Hermes being my favorite). This however gave me a reminder of heated tobacco.
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","A leather jacket, raspberries and a line of coke. Perfect.

Although there are so many similar leather scents out there this was the pioneer.

This and Widian London are my two favourites."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","There's a reason why so many people love this, and why songs are written about it. It has an air of sophistication but also an effortless cool. It is smart, dark and sexy - reminiscent in attitude (if not exact smell) of a black leather biker's jacket and a cigarette. It never feels too dark or heavy - it's just right. However, even though it's the closest thing I own to a signature, I have never been able to describe it or 'get inside it', such is my love for it and such is its exquisite blending. Finally though, it has revealed its secrets to me in warmer weather (24*C).

It still opens with a deep hit of new suede and leather, but after twenty minutes or so when the suede makes way, the frankincense reveals itself so much more. It appears as a dry, smoky leather draped over a smooth rounded frankincense. Together they still pack a punch though. The frankincense just gives it that extra bit of class underneath the edgy leather. Later on, there also feels like there could be two facets to the leather accord. A sharpness from the smoky note, and a dryness from the leather and the woods - all contrasting with the roundness from the olibanum. There's also a caramelised burnt toast note, which is often confused as plastic or cocaine, but it's far too nice to pass off as either.

If it seems linear, that's just its genius. It's just tightly composed. Everything sits roughly in the same place - nothing ever too dense and never cloying. Maybe that's the source of its power - and why it held such mystery, such allure, and why I was mesmerised by it - I couldn't separate out its colours.

It occupies a similar place of perfection (but not smell) in my head as Amouage's Jubilation XV. Simply stunning. A modern classic."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","This is bold, dark, dirty and fierce. My wife hates it, so of course I like it even more ;)
The only subtlety about TL is the raspberry note, which is delicate and sweetens the smell of a bikers garage just a touch. I have an 'inspired by' type beard oil from a boutique place on Etsy called House Of Handsome which has more of the sweetness and I actually slightly prefer it, its easier to wear without the olfactory punch in the nose of whoever you meet!"
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","This fragrance is like the Danny and Sandy of the perfume world. Bad boy meets good girl.

When I first put this on I instantly didn't like it. To me, it smelt slightly like sweat,all be it a sweet hint of sweat. But then after about twenty minutes, I fell in love with the smell which turned sweet and powdery on me, but with a slight hint of masculineness.

It conjures up images of getting off with a handsome bad boy in his old but cool car. Old leather seats, he smells of tobacco, any tobacco he may come across, and when you get up close to him, you can slightly smell sweat. Then the scent changes to that of a naughty sweet smelling girl who's been up to no good with the local bad boy! That smell gave me a high once it arrived. And it lasted on my skin all through the night and I could still smell it faintly this morning when I woke, reminding me of the high I'd had the night before.

I liked it eventually, but I'm slightly scared of it at first (rather like a bad boy!)

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","To my nose, a sweet, heavy raspberry explosion. It stays this way for about 3 to 4 hours before the leather comes off the base to dance with the sweet raspberry. Above average projection throughout the longevity of 20+ hours."

You are your own boss. You please yourself."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","Tuscan Leather opens with a moderate to a strong projection of just leather. The leather is an intense accord but it feels as white, leather as opposed to animalic or pungent, yet it has a soft gasoline-vibe. The leather accord overpowers all other notes. The saffron and raspberry create a very faint sweet touch. The thyme is more noticeable and it adds a warm and spicy touch; the olibanum also accents the leather notes with its balsamic and spice tones. Towards the dry-down, the suede and leather join their notes in one that comes across as just leather; finally, amber and woody notes add a woody and resinous touch. The fragrance is linear, there is little change from the opening to the dry-down. Once Tom Ford Tuscan Leather has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a strong projection, bold leather and suede fragrance with woody and very faint fruit touches. The fragrance bold, dry, elegant, casual, formal, exotic, high-quality, leathery, masculine, mature, modern, refined, and very pleasant.

BATCH REVIEWED: 2020
WOW RATING: 9/10. This is an impressive bold leather and suede fragrance.
DISLIKE RATING: 6/10. The leather note is strong; it has a soft gasoline-like vibe that some people are likely to find it offensive.
UNIQUENESS: 6/10. Leather is a very common note, although Tuscan Leather is a great one.
MASS APPEAL: 4/10. Leather fragrances are not among the most crowd-pleasing fragrances. The combination of leather and suede creates a gasoline-like vibe in this fragrance.

LONGEVITY: 5/10. About five hours with 3 consistent moderate projection.
SEASONS: Fall, winter. Colder nights and climate-controlled environments.
OCCASIONS: Formal events, outdoor gatherings, office, casual, holidays, clubbing. In moderation, this is an office-friendly fragrance.
VERSATILITY: 5/10. Moderate, somehow limited by seasons and occasions.
GENDER: Masculine. Traditionally leather is a masculine tone.
AGES: 30 and above.
RECOMMENDATION: This is a great fragrance for casual and formal wear. However, its cost/value isn’t favorable, for $325 for 100ml. Consider alternatives.
BLIND-BUY: No, sample it first.
SIMILAR: These are examples of leather fragrances.

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","This is one of the most unique leather scents I’ve ever smelt. I originally smelt it at the department store – It’s very intense for the first 1-2 hours. If you are indoors, it can be unbearable at times. It is best worn if you are out doors before stepping inside. But after that it smells absolutely divine."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","A rendering of the smell found in a car with leather upholstery. A leather car upholstery suggests luxury, so the inclusion of such a perfume in Tom Ford's prestigious portfolio cannot surprise anyone.

I smelled much more complex and attractive leather-based perfumes than Tuscan Leather, but I understand very well the attachment for this fragrance. I like the smell, but I find it hard to associate it with a perfume.

It is intended exclusively for cold weather.

The projection is initially high, after which it becomes medium, and the longevity is exceptional.

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","On first spray my senses embraced the thyme note which is reminiscent of childhood and thyme-picking hikes through the mountains. And when the leather came in, my memory jumped to my grandfather's store-room in which he kept his leather boots and rubber gloves that he used when going to the fields to harvest.
What I mean is that it is very masculine and got that working man vibe to it; not office-like or soft gentlemanish type of fragrance..this needs a beard, some heavy jeans, boots, rings, strong arms and definitely an outdoor-work environment.
Hell, this even needs a horse!! Imagine a nobleman on a horse riding through fields of thyme with his breath a bit alcoholic while carrying back a basket of raspberries and holding a classic hand-rolled cigarette in his mouth riding like he don't give a damn about anything.
It got me compliments and the waiter at the coffee-shop asked me about it. I quickly gave him the sample because I had already oredered a bottle, so let him enjoy it a bit.
On my way out a woman stopped and looked at me and froze then asked about the perfume. BUT...not everyone will like it, definitely not young girls...only women will like it and definitely above thirty. If you're into older women then go for it, it's your guaranteed bait.
Rugged, dry leather, earthy thyme, smoke, alcohol, and finally comes the sweetness of raspberries just to ease a rough journey of harsh, solid display of sweaty masculinity in a Mediterranean environment.
I don't think it's for women, yet, I would recommend ombre leather for poisonous, sociopathic women who love dark fragrances."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","This is a plain and simple stroke of genius.

This scent smells like so many things, places, memories, emotions at the same time that is hard to review at all.

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","I really like Tuscan Leather!

The leather it makes me think of is of a well loved leather chair next to a bright window in a personal library. It is smokey and woody but the fruit and floral accords brighten it up to be suitably unisex. It feels like idealized old world academia.

a woman wearing this has some power behind her and a man wearing this is very approachable."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","Very dry and very earthy leather. That's basically all it comes off as to me.

It's every so slightly softer and sweeter than Ombre Leather, but to me it still just smells like dry leather and basically nothing else.

There's an earthy, greenish, musty feel that almost borders on smelling like an old wet towel that wasn't dried properly and has started to smell a bit moldy... Or like old soil... Or like a tobacco pipe that hasn't been used for a long time.

This is clearly not for me."

This is another smashing scent form the TF private blend line. You can get very strong leather notes from this, with a small aroma of raspberry lurking in the background. This is probably number 2 to Tobacco Vanille in my book. Girls will love this I’m telling you, people are going to love this. You’re going to love this. I wouldn’t recommend this for a blind buy, it’s definitely a required scent, but it’s one of those fragrances that you need to smell if you’re into frags. For me this is also very long lasting, but for me it didn’t have as great of a sillage compared to tobacco Vanille.

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']",I keep trying different niche fragrances in hope of finding something that I love more than TL and I keep being disappointed. This remains the best fragrance ever made to me. It's true that it is not the beast that it once was but modern reformulations are still great.
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","As I mentioned in my Oud Wood review, very early into my fragrance journey I went to a department store to smell fragrances. The names of this and Oud Wood intrigued me so I sniffed each. Both were love at first smell, but for different reasons. While Oud Wood is a luxurious woody delight that sits on your skin like a silk blanket, Tuscan leather is pure opulence. I could not pick out the notes at the time but it smelt like ‘wealth’. It captured my imagination for months until I saved up enough to buy it. Now I’m more experienced with fragrance I feel that I understand this beast more, but still not completely.

I’m not going to bother talking about the listed notes, but to me this doesn’t smell like ‘straight leather’ like a boot, I’m assuming it’s the raspberry but to me it’s a completely unique smell. This uniqueness is especially apparent in what can only be described as a ‘blue-centric’ town in terms of fragrances. I wore this to a concert I was playing in while dressed in all black and for some reason everyone wanted to talk to me. I had sprayed very lightly so I assume the effect was subtle, but it is an extremely unusual and alluring scent.

Speaking of which it’s a monster of performance, in winter I go with 1 spray on the chest only, and I wouldn’t dream of wearing it in any other season. But it’s nice to have in my cupboard just to sniff everyday, it’s that good. It smells like ‘the man I want to become’ if that makes any sense.

Anyway this is a solid 9 for me, would be a 10 but the fact is it is very hard to pull off in most occasions. It’s not casual by any stretch of the imagination, especially for someone in their early twenties. But come this winter time, if the quarantine ends, I will be rocking this in parties as it always gets a reaction. Not compliments thusfar, but people do treat you differently.

EDIT: A few days ago I wore this (3 sprays - arms and chest) on a warm spring day c.18-20 degrees centigrade. It’s different to the deep winter smoky leather, the raspberry, saffron and thyme poke through more. It’s really shockingly elegant, the dry down is possibly better in the warmer weather...? I will test this on a summer evening in a few months for sure... I have a feeling it could work. Either way it smells extremely luxury and exclusive."

As I put my nose to the used cap my nipples instantly went hard and my entire body was covered in goose bumps.

Three sprays and you will smell like a a candy coated brick of Columbian gold. Rough, powerful and sexy this is confidence in a bottle.

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","Tuscan Leather introduces the good'n'old paradoxical formula of uniting tradition/conservatism (intense suede) and youth and openness (a simple and almost linear raspberry). Very pleasant and youthful suede (a bit older age than Bleecker Street suede though - BTW, if you like TL formula but happened to find it a too ""old man"" smell, try or go with Bond Bleecker St, it's the same thing but younger, despite it's another berry there - the blueberry). The raspberry here refers to candy smell, it's that very simple sweet. A shy WOW comes to mind when you realize that the raspberry coexists with the suede for the entire life of the perfume in the skin. It's slightly ambered and muskied. Forget the frankincense: in no way it gets in the way because it ain't there. A double-edged sword: manly and hot, but also sweet and cheerfully inviting. A proposal that always delivers high versatility and, here, some radioactive performance, projecting beast mode for 2h30 and slightly above skin for another 4 hours."

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","This is like Slipknot's Psychosocial: a rough, rugged and raw opening (synthetic frankincense, thyme, oud), that transitions to a beautifully strong and melodic bridge/chorus (raspberry, saffron, jasmine).

then, like the song, it goes back and forth a bit, but the initial shock is muted by the elegant complexity and emotion behind it.

on my skin, it often morphs into a strong cedar accord, which is latent but not omnipresent.

Ive never done cocaine, but ive tasted it, so i can see how this has at least some similarity. it does have a harsh, chemical and wild personality, but that is tamed by the structure and sequencing of the composition. the duality between rough smoke and smooth tart sweetness is a masterful gambit.

this fragrance has serious presence. it is dark, bold, haunting, muscular, untouchably alpha. imagine a Russian mob boss in a Brabus G-wagon, smoking a hash-filled blunt.

in my experience, many women don't like it. but if you wear fragrance to impress women-or anyone- good night and good luck."

Over time I found alternatives which I now prefer because they are more wearable: Godolphin has a greener opening and a ""sexier"" dry down, Aoud Leather has also a ""sexier"" finish with its Ambergris.

The closest clone of TL for me is La Yuqawam, also the best deal if you want that strong dark leather note."

From precipitating itchy noses to borderline anaphylactic reactions, I no longer dare wear it if I’m going to be in an indoor milieu. I really like/love the smell but the adverse physiological reactions it risks triggering in all too many of the people I cross paths with makes it a no go.

Whereas ombre's leather is black and rubbery, this is tan and dry and definitely more bitter. Thought I'd pick up on the raspberry more than I did but wasn't like that at all. I'm sure the saffron and thyme played a part but I forgot these were in the picture. In the background hangs the jasmine and elemi but to my nose had that aventus jasmine-rose vibe. Obviously, the floral pleasantly smooths things as time goes on and things become balanced and less offensive. What I like about this one is that it's more linear than ombre. OL evolves into a powdery sweet mess which kills its badassery. This is coherent, although, does sweeten up and mellow down due to amber and suede.


This puts in my mind a steely-eyed Clint Eastwood-like cowboy/bounty hunter type that the movies try to depict. Rugged as dirt. Dry as Death Valley. Fearless as an inanimate rock."

First of all the leather is very muted and the raspberry is very extreme intensive. But what shocks me the longevity and performance sucks!!!! Honestly sucks after 2 hours there is nothing!!!

I usually pass everyday by House of Fraser and Smell Tuscan leather from the 250ml decanter they had, and it was very potent and beast mode performing juice. However, what I bought from heath row doesn't smell or perform the same.

SHAME ON YOU FORD FOR ROBBING US WITH THESE PRICES!!"
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","I am pretty new to the fragrance world, but am not interested in mass-appealing boring fragrances such as Acqua di gio or Dior Sauvage that smell like anything else. I bought a 30 ml bottle after reading positive reviews everywhere on the internet and having a love for the smell of leather already. Upon first spray, I absolutely hated the small. Really Harsh chemical smell and the leather note was overpowering for me. However, as TL dried down on my skin it became a masterpiece. As time progressed, it lost the thick invasive smell and transformed into a beautiful sweet leather smell mixed with floral and vanilla notes. I instantly became hooked on the smell and find it extremely comforting. Lasted at least 14 hours on my skin and the projection was incredible. I was not expecting the fruitiness before buying TL and it was a pleasant surprise that adds so much depth and character to the fragrance profile. This is the real deal. Tom Ford TL is pure luxury and sophistication. I have not tried wearing it in public yet as I just received it in the mail yesterday. But, I know not everyone will enjoy the smell. Definitely made for those who do not care about receiving tons of compliments, but rather appreciate the uniqueness of a scent and how it makes them feel when smelling it on themselves."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","Tuscan Leather does share some similarities with Ombre Leather, but TL is richer, fuller.

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","Beautiful scent! Oily leather mixed with petroleum and gasoline. Very masculine in the opening. In the mid, the leather meshes with that bright, sweet raspberry note which gives Tuscan Leather some balance. The dry down is where the leather dissipates and the raspberry note becomes more creamy along with some floral notes. One of the best cold weather scents ever made!"
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","A rockstar! in my top five favorite fragrances i've ever warn or got my nose on. Never found another leather fragrance that comes close. The opening can be a bit much but the drydown is sexy, long lasting and projecting just as this type of fragrance should. Beastmode no doubt. The raspberry is the scent that ties it all together. I can't think of a better cold weather lady killer.

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","Hands down my favorite fragrance so far! I purchased a 30ml bottle after receiving a 4ml sample. Longevity is beast, base notes stay on my skin (which I have dryer skin) for at least 12 hours if not longer. Silage is hard to say. My girlfriend says she can smell it at about arms length but not much further. Someone I work with said he smelled it about 6 feet away or so. My favorite part of this fragrance so far is the opening/middle. I think it's the frankincense/olibanum but not sure. It's just amazing, although I love the base notes also! My 30ml bottle should last me a while but I will definitely buy a 50ml bottle or bigger next time. Just picked up a sample of TF Tobacco Vanille and I must say I may have to purchase a bottle of that also, very good, although I like Tuscan Leather a bit more!"

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","The best leather fragrance I have experienced so far. This one honestly took a while to grow on me, as when I was only a couple of years into the hobby of perfumes I managed to get my nose on it, and really didn't care for it much due to it both being a little challenging, and primarily only getting the leather note.

Fast forward a few years, and i'm now in love with it - the way the leather / suede plays off the sweetness of the raspberry, the underlying and more subtle notes swirling around that beautifully masculine leather, all with an edge of smokey ash.. it really is a masterpiece. Performance of this one is phenomenal too, as anyone who has been lucky enough to own it can testify to - 10 hours minimum, it really feels like it lasts forever. If you initially didn't like this fragrance (which is completely understandable) do yourself a favour and revisit it when you've had exposure to a wider range of scents - you won't regret it."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","This is one of about 3 fragrances I've experienced 'love at first sniff' with, having sampled over 200 fragrances.

The dominant notes are leather/suede and raspberry. The intensity of the sharp raspberry peaks initially, and rolls off as the scent dries down, revealing a warm saffron amber sweetness that slowly bubbles to the surface.

Scent: (5 / 5)
Love at first sniff, an empyrean deeply masculine head turner.

Performance: (5 / 5)
Detectable on skin within a foot for about 7 hours, a skin scent for about 12, and will last on clothes until washed.

Versatility: (1.5 / 5)
Nauseating in heat, so stick to cold weather and cool nights. Would only wear with masculine & non-casual clothing as well.

Overall: (5 / 5)
No criticisms, if only fewer people knew about it."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","I smelled this and, honestly, my girlie parts did a double-take! This... THIS! This smelled like a first date, when I was somewhere between a teen and mid-twenties, with a guy wearing a leather jacket in the autumn. It had a toned-down masculine scent with a leathery scent RIGHT UNDERNEATH it, and a slightly perceptible smokey scent beneath that.

I was so shocked, I had to smell it again! Yep, same reaction."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']",Cigarettes and leather with a hint of hair spray. Like you went to a bar the night before and woke up wearing the same clothes. Worldly. Not peaceful. Not calm. No thank you.
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","I know this smell! I know what it replicates. Back in the late 1960s and 1970s, when you were taking a cross country trip with the family and checked into a Las Vegas hotel with a lounge and bar and pool, this is exactly the smell that you would get when you walked into the lobby, all excited to be in Las Vegas and in air conditioning. This is the smell of the leather banquette seating and spilled liquor and a million spent cigarettes still lingering in the air of the lounge off the lobby, plus a hint of gasoline from the pre-unleaded-era cars outside. This scent contains all of it: leather booths, stale cigarette smoke, drinks and drinks spilled, carpet cleaner (faintly fruity), wood and leather bars, air conditioning and the slight staleness of an interior that never has open windows, and the wild West and excitement. The minute I smelled this, it brought back that lost era of Vegas hotels that have all been torn down to make way for the new mega-casino hotels. What makes this so genius, in my view, is that Tom Ford is replicating a scent from a place that no longer exists. Anyone can make a perfume based on leather notes. But there are only a few perfumers who can actually replicate something, like a Vegas hotel lobby/lounge smell from the late 60s or 70s, from decades ago that you cannot smell any more. The nose that created this perfume has created a kind of time machine, and that is genius. Honestly, it is not really a straight up leather smell. It is leather mixed with stale cigarettes, stale ladies perfume still in the air from 2am last night, old hairspray, all the scents that linger in the air from the lounge show and activities of the night before, all circulated with the old air conditioning. I like this perfume because of its ability to recreate the past, but I also like it because it is unique. It is also strong enough that it lasts, which I value a lot. Plus, it does not activate my allergies. One down side to recreating a smell from the past is that people too young to have smelled it in real life are not going to recognize what this is. Ford was born in 1961."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","I get why people peg this as a masculine fragrance. It’s got all the elements of a great masculine fragrance, yet I feel this to be absolutely unisex. The sweetness, smokiness and leather combine into a perfect blend of sex and luxury. I love it on myself and I do consider myself very feminine, but I am also a lover of leather and smoke in my fragrances. It has very meek sillage on me, and in that sense it’s definitely a *private* blend. I’m addicted."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","I love this stuff! I have been sampling for years and just recently made it to the niche stuff.

On first spray the leather is intense, almost too much but in the next 30 minutes it will transform before your very nose. It settles down to a perfect mixture of suede and sweet. The notes say raspberry but I get a very sweet note that is hard to describe. After an hour is when it really shines. Sweet smokey leather that projects moderately. Not too much to offend, but something people close to you can smell with no doubt. A prefect blend that transitions as the day goes by. This one is done well. Bravo, Tom Ford."

It has a heavy leathery and suede smell. It's very animalic and dirty. It smells like sex. It's actually not bad and I would definitely wear it. A good sexy night cologne...
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","You really need to develope your nose to fall in love with this one.

I am into the fragrance game for 4 years, and I got into the niche world this year.

When I first tried Tuscan Leather it was a clear yuck for me, and my girlfriend as well. Then I got a 5 ml decant of Acqua Di Parma Colonia Leather, and I was blown away. Somehow I understood the point of these crisp leather fragrances. I was wearing that AdP with my leather jacket, leather boots, leather belt, leather watch strap, kinda daring outfit.

3 months later, I felt like something changed in my nose, so I went back to the department store to give TL another chance. I immediately knew that I need this fragrance...

I am writing this review wearing the 2010 batch of Tuscan Leather...

It is my clubbing, going to a bar fragrance, it overpowers those ""pear bubblegum boys"" ""sweet vanilla coca cola boys"" anywhere, and it absolutely turn the women's head. Sometimes in a good way, sometimes not, but this is why it is so beautiful... Pure masculinity, and confidence in a bottle. Whenever I wear this one, I feel like I am the alpha...

Scent: 9/10 (at least for me, with only 1-2 sprays as far as my nose as possible)
Masculinity: 10/10 (no further questions)
Versatility: 4/10 (only cold weather with the darkest rough denim leather combo outfit)
Performance: 10/10 (projecting for 6 hours at least)
Longevity: 10/10 (10+ hours)

You need at least a decant of this."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","I bought a 100ml bottle from Sephora this week. Unfortunately, I'm having performance issues with this one. It only lasts for 2-3 hours with low projection.

Is anybody also having longevity problems like me?

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']",This does smell quite anamalic. Maybe it's an indolic jasmine.
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","This...is a masterpiece. This is a MANS fragrance, definitely not unisex, I don’t care how manly your haircut is, how many piercings you have, or how big your gauges are, if you are a women, this fragrance is not for you!

This is Tom Ford himself in a bottle. If Chuck Norris sweats, this is what it will smell like. If the smell of confidence could be captured and put in a bottle, this is what it would smell like. This is for the guy who does not care about anything. If you are not the most bada** motherf****er you know, do not attempt to wear this fragrance, because IT will end up wearing you.

This is a night out fragrance. A red carpet type fragrance. A guy sitting in the VIP area sipping on whiskey while smoking a Cuban cigar type of fragrance. Those are the vibes that this fragrance gives. It is not a versatile fragrance. Do not wear this while dressed casually.It does have a scent that is reminiscent to a certain drug, it certainly gives off those vibes.

This is a very strong leathery fragrance. It is a night time fragrance for sure, and preferably cold weather. 2 sprays and this is the only thing that you will smell for the next 6+ hours so go very easy on the trigger with this one. It is a great fragrance to layer with other fragrances. I love to layer it with Aventus. It really emphasize that smokey, leathery smell that Aventus has and tones down the sometimes overbearing pineapple. Another surprisingly good combination is Tuscan Leather with a little bit of...JPG Ultra Male. The sweetness from the ultra male can tone down that leather note in TL and help to emphasize the sweetness that TL has in its background. This makes TL a little more wearable and versatile and will get you tons of compliments.

Overall a very good, manly, intense, and not-so-versatile fragrance. A bottle will last you a lifetime or two due to its lack of versatility, and it’s sheer strength. When you can pull this fragrance off successfully, it is bada** in a bottle and it is a beautiful scent. Definitely recommend trying it out."

It's clear in it's identity what it's trying to be without all the supporting accords for more depth. This is straight forward leather that doesn't evolve into anything else, just smooth leather from start to finish.

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","This is the very first niche fragrance I had ever smelled. Previously, I had only worn fashion and designer colognes. I happened to walk by a Tom Ford display at Dillards, and curiosity struck me. I had heard of Tom Ford in songs and wondered what the big deal was. I saw Tuscan Leather and recognized the name from a Drake song, so naturally, that was the first fragrance I asked the man to let me sample. The first whiff was something I had never experienced before. It was primal, dark, and hit me like a ton of bricks. I was caught completely off guard, because I had never experienced anything like it. The leather note was intoxicating, I had to keep smelling it, I was addicted to the scent. I took the sample card home with me and could not stop smelling it. Then the sweet raspberry note crept its way through the powerful leathery scent. I did not know fragrances could have such complexity to them. I could not stop thinking about this fragrance, I knew I needed it. This fragrance has a playful arrogance to it, wearing it gives you a sense of confidence that is inexplicable. It is definitely a very polarizing scent, it can sometimes be a bit offensive, but it is by far my favorite of the Private Blend collection."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","This is one of the most unique leather scents I’ve ever smelt. I originally smelt it at the department store – It’s very intense for the first 1-2 hours. If you are indoors, it can be unbearable at times. It is best worn if you are out doors before stepping inside. But after that it smells absolutely divine.

I can smell rich leather and saffron – This is the ultimate leather scent for men.

Be warned, it’s quite strong and remains this way for a few hours. 2-3 sprays of this will last 8+ hours easily. It staying on my clothes for days.

It is definitely a night-time perfume – Preferably in colder seasons (it could get over the top in hot temps)

It’s a heavy leather with a piercing raspberry accompanied by thyme and saffron.

I can definitely relate this to a night of cocaine which I’ve heard this is supposed to resemble. Spot on there mr. Ford

Combined with Tobacco Oud or Oud Wood this become a totally different experience though. The piercing raspberry mellows out and the whole composition becomes more balanced and actually is my favorite scent for a cold winter or autumn day"

If someone is interested in this scent I suggest to test out Byredo Black Saffron. They are very similar but Black Saffron is more smooth and does not have that benzine smell."

The leather perfectly mixes with the sweeter notes to make something truly addicting.

Like Dior's 'Fahrenheit', I enjoy pushing this scent during warm/hot days and in more casual settings -- makes for a completely different vibe.

But for most people, this will work wonderfully as a fall/winter, formal kind of fragrance. The raspberry keeps this from being stuffy on men, while the leather would really make this stand out on a woman."

Iran is famous for it's Saffron and I assume Cyrus the Great's Kitchen must've had an abundant supply of Saffron and his court and hallways must've had Saffron scent lingering in it before and after lavish banquets , Regal fragrance , period. And then there's definitely the ashtray note but.... no complaints, it's an ashtray in a meeting room full of expensive leather furniture where you have just been handed your multi million dollar contract after a narrow competition. If you want to feel dirty rich get a Tom Ford Tuscan Leather!"
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","The fragrance that makes you think you are a billionaire even if you are not.


You will smell sexual, confident, badass and wealthy.
Wear your black suit and tie, slick back your hair and spray tuscan leather, now you will get all the attention from ladies, people haven't smelled anything like this before in their life, They will think what is that amazing smell.
Unique, polarizing, luxurious and rich.
Tuscan leather is the fragrance I imagine gangsters would wear, Someone like al pacino in godfather or tom hardy in legend movie.
Extremely masculine, I have no idea why it's labeled unisex.!
unbelievably long lasting, like it stays for ever on your suit or shirt, and it projects for a good 4 hours and everybody will notice you, not so many compliments like aventus but compliments are intense, like I want to smell you all night.

A masterpice from tom ford's Private Blend. My favorite so far from the line

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","I remember killing time one day at a local department store and, out of the many private blend fragrances by Tom Ford, I picked up Tuscan Leather. It was love at first sight for me, and after waiting a day I went back and bought a 100ml bottle.

I'm going to make a comparison with Dior Homme Parfum because for me, they're in essence a sweet leather scent. The two are world's apart however in their own good ways. DHP is feminine in nature but smells masculine, whereas TL is very masculine despite being unisex. DHP is smooth and creamy whereas TL is abrupt and in your face.

Tuscan Leather to me is strong and forthright, but not flamboyant. It's a suave, charming, arrogant and wealthy man that knows they've made it in life. In fact I'd picture Tom Ford as Tuscan Leather itself.

The leather note can be a bit strong for some, but then the raspberry and florals kick in ever so slightly to calm everything down. When I first tested this, I got a little bit on my fingers which I got strong whiffs of over the next 12 hours. This stuff is strong, so go easy on the sprays. Even still, you'll get a whole days use out of this lovely smell.

I'd probably recommend a 30ml bottle unless you're an absolute die hard fan for it, because this will last you a long time!"
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","Im a big fan of Oud Wood. Wear it all the time. Can’t get enough of it. So my curiosity for TFs other private blends naturally grew with every review I consumed. Tuscan Leather seemed especially promising. But I must say it’s not what I expected.

The first note that hits you is this intense leathery smokiness, where the smoke and leather sort of blends together. The second couple of notes that stand out is a little bit of the thyme and the raspberry, which work pretty well in tandem with the leather. These, to me, are perhaps the most prominent notes. There’s also a sweetness buried somewhere in the smoke and leather, which might be a combination of the raspberry and the amber.

The scent is quite mineral-like and lacks much freshness, in the conventional definition of the word. It does however have a kind of distinct sparkling sharpness to it. It sort of goes beyond what I previously though perfumes could smell like.

Edit: The scent has grown on me a bit since. It´s quite addictive in a strange way. Sort of like it more and more.

Edit 2: Ok. Love the scent now (after 2 months). Some people says it smells like cocaine. Maybe there’s actually cocaine in it?

Scent: Addictive and luxurious
Sillage/projection: Above average
Longevity: Good

Visual projection: Sharp / high-resolution white particles on top, with a gradient towards gray, a hint of beige and brown leather towards the bottom, with a stroke of pink in the middle."

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","Although nowadays it’s very much a mainstream fragrance (that has garnered huge celebrity status), it still manages to convey this edgy, outlaw vibe that gives the wearer the perfect illusion of individuality. It’s the hip hop of the fragrance world! I should hate Tuscan Leather, but I love it. It smells addictive, sexy and confident, it evokes all manner of misbehaviour and is deliciously off message. No wonder so many people elude to cocaine when describing Tuscan Leather; it’s almost as much a drug as it is a fragrance. 10/10"
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","Petrichor, the terraqueous ""rain smell"" that briefly alerts one to a coming storm: that was my impression of this scent, probably my favorite of the Tom Ford brand (not saying a lot, but what the heck, why not do a little review of this!). His other scent releases are unabashedly derivative, lesser imitations, always relegated to the bottom shelf of the small town Sephora. I owned some of this once about four years ago but gifted it to a friend. There are so many different perfume releases these days, its so hard to choose. I really think you have to follow your nose to the best possible option, avoid collecting a million different perfumes, the sex appeal of salesmen and flashy
branding."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","Beautifully blended rasperry and leather. Elegant, intoxicating. That said, quite expensive.

Tonight, I am wearing Tuscan Leather on one arm, and Nabeel Macho Man on the other. I have a pretty developed nose, and honestly, I wouldn't be able to tell which one is which in blind test. Macho Man may be slightly less defined in terms of notes, but honestly, it's really hard to discriminate one from the other.
I am impressed on how Nabeel managed to create a perfect clone of TL, not only in terms of scent, but also performance (Macho Man may even perform slightly better. For your info: 1.6oz of TL retails for approx $180, while an oil stick of Nabeel MM retails for approx $5. Feel free to spend your money as you want, but the $175 difference in expense is like throwing money in the toilet bowl. May I suggest we buy Nabeel's Macho Man and give the $175 leftover to a charity? (or buy other frags with those!). If it's worth, I spend the money, but here, really, the price difference is NOT justified.

As far as I'm concerned, I'm not a fan of that strong rasperry note, and prefer leather fragrances like Tom Ford Ombre Leather, or Gucci Guilty Absolute. Just a like for me.

Fall/Winter evenings, 30+, unisex (slightly feminine IMO)

Edit: 5 hours in: TL has become a skin scent, Macho Man still projects at 3-4 inches... just saying...
Edit2: 12 hours later, TL is dead, while MM is still there as a skin scent."

The leather and raspberry absolutely an eye popping good combo that has sillage to die for! While I normally don't put age on most fragrances I truly believe this is for a confident handsome man that is over 25. The performance is wonderful and the projection is solid for the first 2-3. Absolute timeless classic that never get's old. Tom Ford Private Blends are subjectively over priced but this one is worth every penny. Beautiful, seductive, and smile inducing masterpiece!

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","I think I am a fan of leather scents, since I enjoy dior parfum, le male essense, and other fragrances that have a strong leather note. For some reason I never was a huge fan of this. It's not that I don't like it, it's just something about it that smells dated to me or something. I can see why people like it however. Its a refined leather smell with this light berry overtone. It has it's own DNA that is unique to this scent. I think the clones out there are REALLY close.. There was a scent by Mac, I forgot the name but it was pretty much identical to it. Plus everyone knows about la yuqawan whatever. That one is pretty close too.

I respect the scent and why people enjoy it, it's just not really anything that grabbed me. Definitely not worth the Tom Ford price for me. Then again no fragrance really is.

For me scent 3/5

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","This is a very bold, loud, yet refined and complex beast mode fragrance. It has the allure of Drake naming a song after it, and the bad boy rep of not only smelling of high end leather (like in a brand new Rolls Royce or Bugatti), but also smells a bit like cocaine! I guess there is also a subtle raspberry note which adds even more slightly fruity complexity.

The combo of the actual juice, and all the above folklore def makes you feel like a successful boss who doesnt play by the rules when you put it on. Having said that, it might be too strong for some people to like, so I think it could be a bit polarizing. But I personally think its amazing, especially for night time, or cooler weather."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","So I have tried it and got it as a present for my dad. On me it is horrendous. It just smells like strong leather on my skin and stayed that way and I hated it on me but on my Dad it smells great. His skin reacts very well with it. it retains the leather which softens and there's berries and some vanilla. It's also reasonably ageless although I cant imagine many men in their early 20s managing to wear this well. Its strong, its powerful and it blasts presence."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","One of my first loves and probably my first ""adult"" signature scent. It was also my first TF fragrance and responsible for opening my eyes to the world of niche.

There's still some on a bottle in my collection and I'll spray it every so often. It brings back memories.

There are now similar fragrances on both sides of the price spectrum: more sophisticated and (even more) expensive (I love Clive Christian's C) as well as cheaper clones. I'm not looking forward to the day it won't be in my collection again... but that day will come."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","This is a MASTERPIECE. It's famous for a reason. Try it, let it sink in and try again. Often copied, never replicated. They say this for a reason too. The first time I sniffed it, I got a severe headache. A week later, I could still smell it on my shirt. Top quality product for a premium price. You're paying not just for the perfume inside but the brand name and of course the presentation as well.

Every time I have worn it, I have had at least 1 woman compliment me. Every single time !!!

It's that good and not just any sleazy, average compliment but people actually come tracking you. It's a beautiful scent you'll more than likely not appreciate. It's not for everyone.

Classy, sophisticated, serious, toxic, obnoxious, noir, dark, posh, expensive are some words that suitably describe this fragrance.

This is my second review of it and I can't stress enough, that you absolutely need to have this in your collection if you're a true fragrance enthusiast. Average joe might skip cuz this isn't his average crowd pleasing Armani or Paco Rabanne. This is Niche Quality product. None of that Creed BS. You get what you pay for. Smells like a man and performs like a man. No more no less. This is not your average western perfume. I can easily compare it to the quality offered by Amouage.

Liquid gold is what I call it."

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","This is my favorite Private Blend, this and Italian Cypress, are rich, manly, close to masterpieces. They are not so perfumy or gimmicky as other Private Blends, that are often spectacular on first impression, and then later don't feel too wearable.
This is very wearable, as in signature fragrance.

I think masterpieces mix and blend contrasting notes. This does it by the dark and oily leather, contrasting with the rasberry and a touch of Jasmine. The safron is great and plays an important part."

Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","This is not just any leather. This is not like showing up at the pot luck smelling like your new chaps and donning a trusted whip, heaven forbid. This is what Grace Kelly, Sophia Loren, or Audrey Hepburn would probably smell like in their mink coats, showing up for dinner at the Hotel de Paris in Monte-Carlo, with a tuxedo clad accomplice at their side, smelling like the inside of a Bentley that has been bathed in jasmine and incense. I see Frank Sinatra singing at the back of the restaurant. Tom Ford must have had some great dreams after creating this one, I'll bet.

Projection is a lot stronger than you might think and sillage is just enough to have the waiters watching your every move. For winters only (keep the Bentley in the garage until then)."
Tuscan Leather Tom Ford (unisex) ~ 2007,"['leather', 'fruity', 'animalic', 'sweet', 'amber', 'smoky']","It took me 6 years to appreciate this fragrance. Recently I tried it again and I loved it instantly. Tuscan Leather is a simple composition but classy and quite manly. I believe that women can wear it but it leans to masculine scents. Suitable for winter, fall, spring and cool summer nights. It's not so heavy as many reviews say.

It opens with a mild gasoline vibe with a tiny essence of tires. In the air, from a distance, the only I can smell is leather. The leather in TFTL is safe, refined and the combo with the other notes makes it elegant. The leather after some time feels more like suede than leather. Smooth and refined. After that emerges the raspberry with a tiny jasmine somewhere at the background and mild olibanum which exists only to support the dominant notes, it doesn't play big role. Then comes the thyme along with the saffron which becomes stronger as time passes. The thyme stays at the background. I also get faint traces of black pepper. Dominant notes are suede, leather, raspberry, saffron and thyme. The rest notes are mild.

I'm quite pleased from its performance although I didn't found the monster I was expecting. Sillage is moderate, projection is heavy for some minutes then calms to a moderate and it settles close to the skin quite quickly and stays such for most of its life. The longevity is good. From my first test it lives for about 8-8.5 hours which is enough for me. Of course I'll do some full wearings and I'll update if necessary.
Tuscan Leather feels luxurious and has a mature vibe. It's not old school by any means but it's not for teens imo. Better with a suit or with nice clothes..

If you want rough leather try the much cheaper Gucci Gucci Guilty Absolute niche quality imo

If you want a more playful version of TFTL with an oriental twist try Arabesque Perfumes Kohel

If you feel that the raspberry is too much in TFTL and want a more dark/masculine version try Bois 1920 Oro 1920

If you want the King of leathers try The Spirit of Dubai Meydan stellar performance compared to the other scents mentioned here."

Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","This one is nice, and indeed a (gentle) masculine musk, IMO. I don't know why but this reminds of a male version of J&J baby shampoo, should the original J&J baby shampoo scent be for girls. It is very wearable for either a man or a woman, but I would prefer smelling this on my man. I get more musk than vanilla or spice. Not a FB interest for me, but a well done aromatic musk for those who prefer such scents!

*This one does not at all remind me of Shalimar perfume, though I see lots of ""smells like"" for this one..."
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","Update:

The 20 yrs limited edition seems to have the concentration of the older version. Hope this doesn't change."
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","Chose a sample of this to go with my bottle of Lys Méditerranée, as I am pre-emptively searching for a deep winter scent. The orange and vanilla notes come to me, but most striking is the aroma of a Catholic church with a light but palpable whiff of incense and inviting dampness. It is absolutely beautiful, and has gone straight onto my wish list. Almost makes you excited for winter to come."
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","Lush. Amber run riot. An unusual and spectacular brace of clove makes this a unique mid note to an otherwise sultry composition. Lasts forever. Although I identified this as female, I also can envision this on a Middle Eastern or South Asian man. I am still sampling this to determine if this will be another addiction. Regardless, it's definitely a no at the dentist's office, or any mundane place. This is something Icwould wear for me."
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","Hey! Im the Modern Shalimar!

This smells like a modernized Shalimar without those Animalic facets, it has indeed a Musc that might come across animalic.

But its way easier to pull then Shalimar! If you own both of those! Do make a comparison!

Back on the Fragrance! I Wish i loved Clove! If i was i would love this Fragrance!

I Understand its constant nature for change and development! This fragrance has many faces!

Its a masterpiece Aight! Just not for me!

Solid 9!"
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","6.5/10. Immediate: what I want to smell on a man. Then fruity musk, red fruits and rosewood/red cedar. The woodiness is strong with rose water. Cinnamon comes 8 hours later and I prefer this part but have to wait a long time. True to other Frederic Malle scents, smells natural and not chemically. This one is not my favorite."
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","This is how I remember one catholic convent chapel smelled like. It's odd, there is no lily note listed, but as I smell it all I can think of is this particular chapel with fragrant lilies on the altar. Absolutely lovely."
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","Has this really been reformulated? Because to me this perfume is both striking and potent. My review is based on a sample I got this month.

It’s the sexier, naughtier brother (sister?) compared to Dans Tes Bras. I think I like DTB more because it’s more like a sexy intelligent gentleman sitting in the corner smiling at you but MR is more like the cocky sexbomb being the centre of attention. MR is very sweet and I personally think this leans more female. Not your average sweet, but more of a musky, thick sweetness like molasses. You know how the smell of sex isn’t particularly nice or anything but it’s kind of addictive? MR has that character.

Performance is beast. I did 2 small sprays on my neck, and really it just wouldn’t come off and 3 days later I lay in bed still getting wafts of Musc Ravageur. Mind you I had washed my hair twice. Impressive but annoying when you feel like wearing something different."
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","This is a very peculiar fragrance, that deserves its legendary status.

To my nose it has a camphor note at the very start that is somehow disturbing as it tickles my nostrils and makes me sneeze.
But, when you pass these first 5 minutes, the very heart of this spicy-oriental-vanillic scent develops.
The cinnamon note is there, spicy but not too strong, I can smell also some clove, pepper and nutmeg ; later, I detect also some juniper and balsamic resins.

The drydown is quite soft, when all the spices are gone, it's a classic soft ambery-vanilla one, that changes into something animalic, strong (=musc, and not the clean type! )
Quite a sillage and a good lasting power.

Mind you, this is not your typical powdery-oriental.
Musc Ravageur is a strong perfume, with huge personality; compelling or disturbing, it depends on you and yor skin chemistry.

I like it, as I like many orientals; it could easily suit a man (provided he has the personality to wear it! this is not a fresh water!).
Definitely a must try.

It's sweet, spicy, sexy and stunning.

I wore it as my scent of the day yesterday and as I was moving around this morning, preparing for my day, I was still catching wafts of it, though much fainter and I first sprayed it almost 24 hours ago. Sitting here typing this review, I am still smelling it quite strongly radiating from my neck up to my nose.

The citrus and lavender give it a very fresh and clean opening, but on my skin, that is very short lived and enters into a spicy vanilla, almost gourmand scent profile pretty quickly. Then, the musk and woods come out to play but never take center stage, instead the amber dances with the spicy vanilla for many, many hours. It's sweet but never cloying, it's woody but never dominated by the woods. It's musky but always somehow still fresh.

It projected extremely well for me for the first 5-6 hours before settling closer to the skin. It radiated a good 3-4 feet out and was leaving wonderful sillage trails for about the same amount of time. Performance is stellar and for the price, I really wouldn't expect any less. This fragrance delivers, beautiful scent, excellent performance, artistic uniqueness. I've never smelled anything quite like this fragrance.

I really love it. I'm so glad I finally pulled the trigger on a bottle.

Scent : 10/10, so well blended, so seductive, so beautiful. I feel it leans more masculine but it is unisex.
Longevity : 10/10 almost 24 hours after spraying, I can still smell it radiating from my skin
Projection : 10/10 it's not a beast but it really radiates from my skin extremely well, again about 3-4 feet.
Sillage : 10/10 if you're still still leaving an intoxicating scent trail 5-6 hours after spraying, then it's doing it's job extremely well
Overall : 10/10

Final thoughts ...
I don't know about reformulations and all that stuff because I've only sampled 2020 batches and my bottle is a 2020 batch but I can't complain. To me, as it is today, it is a masterpiece. Maybe if I had smelled previous batches or original batches, I might be able to complain but I can't since my review is for the fragrance as it is today and in my opinion, it is a perfect 10 all around. I love this stuff and I am so blessed to have a bottle in my collection. This fragrance is really something special. It might not be a fragrance for everyone but I do believe everyone should smell and sample it, just to experience it at least once."

My preference leans towards Mandodari. Musc Ravageur has no lasting power in my opinion. So disappointed in my blind buy. Musc Ravageur is nice however it’s not as nice as other Frederic Malle fragrances I have.
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","What can I say about this legendary perfume that hasn't already been said more eloquently by others? I've only smelled very recent batches of Musc Ravageur, and my bottle is from 2019, so I can't contribute much on how this stacks up against past formulations. I can say that I couldn't be happier to finally have this in my collection, and that it's truly masterful.

While the musk in question isn't hugely animalic, it's far from neutral. Rather, it's just dirty enough to make things interesting and balance with the other primary notes. The blend is exquisitely smooth, warm, and rich thanks to the dry, naturalistic vanilla, finely spiced cinnamon, and more intensely spicy clove (I could swear that I smell mace here as well, but it may just be my imagination). The sandalwood and tonka diffuse the density of the vanilla, spices, and musk, imparting powdery and woody notes that jive particularly well with the cinnamon.

Now, all of this is quite dark and velvety, so it would make sense to add some more luminous tones for contrast. Hence, the lightest brush of crisp lavender and what I consider to be the master-stroke: fabulously pungent, juicy tangerine. I don't pick up on the bergamot or other woods, but that's probably a personal olfactory failing and the result of such a well-blended composition. The cleverness of tangerine is that it's tangy and slightly tart, but not as acidic or sour as other citric notes like lemon, lime, or orange. It thereby serves to soften and saturate the spices, provide dimension to the vanilla and woods, and add a kind of polished twang to the musk. It's an ingenious perfume, steeped in decadence, and seductively structured. It beckons to you, but never overwhelms—ravishing musk, indeed!

Despite sharing a few notes with Shalimar, the proportions are totally different in Musc Ravageur, which is overall less animalic and sassy. I perceive very little resemblance between them; one does not recall the other. And while I understand the associations with the holidays—mulled cider and baked goods and all that—it doesn't feel especially ""Christmassy"" to me, or very gourmand, despite some of the built-in vanilla-amber sweetness. It's its own beast, one partial to curling up luxuriantly by the fire, elegantly négligé. I see some reviewers complaining about performance, but on my skin, it excels in both longevity and projection. Perfectly unisex but far from sexless, and better in cooler weather, in the evening.

This and Carnal Flower are my two favorites in the Malle collection, and they're both quite sexy, but differently so. Where Carnal Flower is the botanical embodiment of flesh-bound desire, Musc Ravageur is carnality itself, channeled into the suavest, most sumptuous vessel. If CF recalled the debaucherous greenhouse of Émile Zola's La Curée, MR is the poignant warmth of the coulisses in Nana."
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","Musc Ravageur, to my nose, is warm Xmas spices, sweetened with vanilla and rounded by gentle musk. The slightly herbal and sour opening fades very quickly on my skin, with punchy Xmas spices dominating within the first couple of minutes.

An exquisite gourmand with peppery nose feel.

It is delicate for a spice scent - more elegant but somewhat underprojecting as far as cinnamon and vanilla scents for men are concerned.

Musc Ravageur smells masculine to me - a niche and softer version of 1 Million Prive, etc. Durability is good, but projection is average.

In my humble opinion, however, Musc Ravageur is not significantly better than most cinnamon and vanilla focused scents to justify its price tag. Its delicate and rich blend will not smell too different from masculine designer spices to the average person.

This is a Xmas scent for perfume lovers and niche collectors."

Like others have said, quite similar to Caron Pour Un Homme -- but with more depth. A blast of lavender, vanilla and musk is what I get. But the lavender is livelier and complemented with some soft spices, transitioning seamlessly into vanilla, transitioning into a musk note that is also more animalic. So, the main notes are similar, but meld together better than in Pour Un Homme."
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","Lovely, warm, fuzzy vanilla whose tooth-achingly sweetness is cut short by powder and musk.

On my skin this perfume skipped the lavender intro and went direct to the base: spices, tonka, amber, but everything is delicate, almost hinted, while the dominant accord is musky and vanillic. It is sexy and evocative, not in your face sexual, no indoles nor animalic notes whatsoever.

I expected Valmont but I got Danceny, this musc has nothing of the ravageur; it is a comforting, sweet chap who will cook you dessert, keep you warm on the sofa, and will have vanilla sex with you - eventually."

I vehemently disliked the opening, as the musk-lavender-cloves combo was harsh, clashy, and somehow too animalic, like an aftershave gone bad. However, a couple of hours afterwards, it morphs into a delicious citrusy, ambery, woody, cinnamon-vanilla fragrance. I even like the tonka bean in it, which I tend to dislike as a note. This phase is the perfect cold-weather perfume: it smells cosy and envelops you softly, without taking over your space. Nonetheless, the opening is just a big no for me, so I'll have to pass on this one.
Oh, and if anyone was wondering, this one is 90% similar to Mehareés by L'Erbolario. Mehareés opening is less clashy, but its dry-down is not as well-blended as MR. However, given the 200€ price difference, I'd get Mehareés over MR any day.

Not sure what the reformulation complaints are about, to me this smells maybe even better than it used to. I feel it's more complex than in the past, and maybe that's because it's not as heavy or dense and allowed the notes to open up a bit more.

Sometimes I get a very plush, fuzzy musk with tons of cinnamon, or sometimes the lavender is far more noticeable and the fragrance is highly aromatic. Other times I get a very anise-styled bready smell due to the cloves, or a real smoky, dark Shalimar come mid. I haven't even mentioned the fact that I also tend to get an almost chocolaty vibe in the dry-down depending on the mood of the fragrance.

Call me crazy but if there was a reform, it's better than it was because as much as I loved it, I recall it being a very linear fragrance. Now, it's like 6 fragrances in one depending on how the notes decide to play on my skin.

It smells divine - vanilla and cinnamon and freshly baked goodness - it's almost boozy it's so rich. You want to lean in and take a bite... but you know the minute you do the lion will devour you.
Musc Ravageur.

Hmm. No, perhaps there's a better way to describe it...

You're a tangerine, but also a cinnamon role, but wait, no, YOU'RE A WILD ANIMAL running through the woods!

Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","Blind bought this fragrance, upon the first use I was a bit unsure of the scent however once the scent settled down into my skin it became heavenly. An absolute masterpiece."
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","I just don't understand. I do understand, like I get it, but I don't get it. There *is* a funky sebaceous musk in there, and it's more prominent in Helmut Lang EDC (minus the ugly vanillla, plus hairspray) and especially Helmut Lang EDP (plus heliotropic baby oil). But this does not smell expensive or covetable to me, and curse whoever once wrote that it smelled like vanilla-scented dollarstore dog bone toy, because the truth is fierce and heartless.

There is a definite, deep similarity to Meharees and also Safran Troublant. But the Meharees is just better in my opinion (very good actually) because its layered notes are more real-smelling, not so wacky-wonky-chewy-plastic. Meharees gives you dates and spices and vanilla and black musk simmered and swirled together. MR is a laboratory smell.

But that musk in there is good, I'll say. I do dig the Helmut Langs very much. But I'd love Roucel to make a perfume that just goes whole hog for that musk, because sometimes I crave it without all the other stuff."
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","A beautiful fragrance. While it centers heavily around vanilla, the other notes do two things. First, they make the vanilla less intense. Vanilla fragrances can be very sweet and in this one that gets toned down. Making it more wearable. Second, and this is more difficult to describe, they make the fragrance more unique. Yes, there is vanilla, but with such a twist that it's different and unique enough to not just be another vanilla fragrance.

It's not animalic to me, although I can imagine some people get that element from it. I think it depends on how it dries down on your skin. There certainly is a nature, earthy type of element to it, which is the counterweight to balance out the vanilla. It's quite genius since it works really well. When smelled on the application spot, both sides are very recognizable. In the air they blend and this is where, in my opinion, the fragrance really shines.

I've read cozy, comfort, addictive in the other reviews and yes, I would agree. This is one you would wear for yourself to feel good. While it also being pleasant to other people. It's not extreme, though it does touch on being polarizing slightly. Its uniqueness makes it something that does either fit your taste or it doesn't. In that regard it's not a safe blind-buy, so make sure to sample it.

Performance is excellent. I haven't counted the hours, but it will last through a regular day, with a skin scent being clearly there still the next day. Projection is good. It does not fill a room, which is good in my opinion. It forms a nice bubble around you and while that bubble shrinks, it does take a long time before it doesn't project at all anymore. And it has a nice sillage for even longer.

Versatility is something I find difficult to say right now. I'd wear it on all occasions. But that's a matter of taste. The hardest part is if it's good for hot weather. Maybe it's too sweet for it, maybe not. For colder weather it works just fine.

The quality is 10/10. The ingredients are of the highest quality, as you would expect from a Frederic Malle perfume. Therefore the price is justified in my opinion. It's a quality luxury item and thus appropriately priced. You don't need a lot by the way, a few sprays go a long way. So your bottle will last a good while.

The nose-blindness effect is pretty strong for me with this fragrance. It can appear to have gone or diminished greatly pretty quickly. But hours later when your nose detects it again, it's obvious that it was there pretty strongly the whole time.

Conclusion: masterpiece but do sample it since it's pretty specific when it comes to taste."

I love the warm/woody/animalic vibe, but something in it in how it comes together comes across as honey to me and honestly is kind of stomach turning. I am not sure what it is, if it is too sweet for me or the lavender or if it is the ""forbidden"" part everyone keeps talking about.

Which makes it unfortunate that I get great longevity out of this. By the end of the day I can still smell it on my skin.

So I guess for this one you really need to be looking for something sweet and honey-like. This combination here just made me nauseous."

I feel I shouldn't like it this much, but I'm hooked. This is a my cooler weather quarantine comfort scent. It's so soft and cozy and grounded. Yes, there's that animalic scent, but despite that I love it. The animalic/ barnyard vibe is really strong at first, but it does soften and almost disappear though a hint is still there. But maybe it's that hint of bad that makes it feel grounded and comforting. It's a perfume that is difficult to describe, as is my attraction to it. One of my favorite scents in the world is the smell of soft, hot cat fur on a cat that has been napping in a sunbeam for a good long while, and there's something about this that is almost as good as hot cat fur in the drydown."

This is not an easy scent to describe. This is more like a feeling and the experience! A sexy, semi gourmand, spicy, dark and sweet scent that comes alive on your skin, develops and transforms as the time passes. The opening is a little challenging but the drydown is magical! The scent interacts with your skin and some times the drydown comes more vanilic, some times more spicy and some times more musky.. I haven't encountered something like this with another fragrance!

Performance is amazing, it stays for over 12 hours and projects really good for 3+ hours, after that comes closer to the skin but it's easily noticeable. This is a very sexy, alluring scent and it's best use is on a date or night out!

Overall, this is to me wearable art, a masterpiece! You can't judge this scent only by the notes or performance etc.. This scent takes you on a journey, it's more about the experience and the overall feeling. I guess that this is a must try for everyone who loves the art of perfumery..

Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","Soft, powdery musk with an animalic undertone.

Musc Ravageur (MR) is one of Frederic Malle's best sellers, if not the best seller.

It is a musky scent, soft and powdery. It has a mild woody spiciness, and a bitter, almost animalic, floral undertone.

The vanilla/lavender combo adds a smooth and somewhat clean aspect to the musk. The vanilla is not sweet nor very gourmand; just its smell without the sweetness.

This powdery scent of musk is lightly seasoned with cinnamon and cloves, and the sandalwood mainly adds a soft woodiness to the scent. It's from here the animalic undertone comes. If there was civet listed, I would totally vote on it as ""noticeable"". Also, I thought geranium was a main player given the floral bitterness but it's not.

The citruses are barely noticeable and serve only to liven up the scent and prevent it from being too woody/heavy.

Overall the scent is musky, powdery, smooth, mildly-vanillic, clean, with a bitter woody spiciness.

While it doesn't smell exactly like it, it really is in the same category as Pour un Homme de Caron: soft, powdery, clean, non-sweet vanilla/lavender, and barbershopy to an extent, PuHdC more than MR in the last point. I'm surprised at the lack of its mention in the reviews other then Heifrank's.

It is really good and simple yet interesting scent, but is it worth the hype? Honestly, no. I was left underwhelmed when I first smelled it. Although, I do see its appeal.

Musc Ravageur is a mature, cool weather scent, that works both for semi-causal and formal occasions, but suits the latter more.

This is actually much sweeter than I thought it was going to be. In the opening I get quite a bit of musk, vanilla, and cinnamon. As it dries down the musk dissipates and it’s mainly a powdery vanilla. I didn’t see heliotrope listed in the notes, but I definitely get it, or at least that vibe.

In my opinion it’s completely unisex. I like the scent a lot, but unfortunately it becomes a skin scent on me and there is never any real projection off of my skin; I can’t smell it on myself after about 30 minutes unless I dig my nose into my skin. As a skin scent it lasts about three hours on me."

To me it isn’t even that ‘animalic’ - I get vanilla (my skin amplifies vanilla) and powder through too. It is actually quite soft, sensual, and inviting. Excellent performance, and moderate sillage with one or two sprays (which is enough.) It is my secret pleasure and absolutely a comfort scent.

I don't get the vanilla note that seems to be most voted here, but it is definitely ""vanillic"" from the amber and tonka.

It dries down after about 1.5h to a lovely warm scent with the tonka being the most prominent and amber as a support note. The musk adds a sort of humanistic/animalistic touch, like smelling someones skin. This ""skin"" vibe actually gives me goosebumps sometimes, like when you smell someone you are in love with. In the background there is a really subtle herbacous accord that I can't quite identify but it might come from the combination of the spices and lavender.

Really sexy, sensual and inviting. Above average longevity and lasts even longer on clothes."

The opening is citric-vanillic (hence the Shalimar vibe), and then other notes emerge - mainly cinnamon and cloves, mixed with tonka and musk, creating the warm, ambery, sweet, ever so slightly animalic composition. So, if you like Coromandel and/or Marocain (or Grand Soir and such), then this new, tamed, not so 'ravaging' Musc Ravageur is your new best mate.

Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","21st CENTURY SHALAMAR?

OVERVIEW: Vanilla is one of the first aroma’s we’d ever come to know, with such deep and rich scent memories. To me it has such a feminine allure. On the one hand, it’s the sexy sweet skin of your lover. On the other, it’s creamy, lactonic and maternal, with notably high doses of natural vanilla found in mothers milk. Musc Ravageur embodies both.

COMPOSITION: Musc Ravageur opens with a heavy vanilla blast, the spices offsetting the sweetness. I get images of a Victorian cathouse, or the Moulon Rouge. High class and feminine, mysterious, yet with a sleezy double life. She’s got something she doesn’t want you to know - for now at least.

On the other side, I see a proud mother lioness, fierce yet nurturing. Powerful in her own right, yet yielding to the male lion where he leads best. Separate they are vulnerable, together they are strong. Both powerful in their own roles. She as mother and lover. He as hunter and provider. Together they are complete.

AROMA: thick, heavy, rich dense oriental vanilla with heavy spices. Powdery, spicy, moody. Heavy on vanilla and clove above everything else. I’m recently learning my taste deeper and this taught me a few things. First, I prefer airy, aromatic scents - this is dense, thick, sultry, powdery. Next, I prefer naturalistic smells - woods, green, earth, vetiver - this is sticky, spicy and sweet.

WEAR WHAT YOU LOVE: this is extremely feminine to me. Wear what you love but I personally love manly scents, and I didn’t get that from the 100s of reviews who claim every single fragrance is unisex - very confusing. To me this is pretty yet powerful, like a 21st century interpretation of Shalamar. Best on individuals who embody a feminine spirit.

VERDICT: sometimes the embodiment of a goddess, sometime’s expensive oriental candle. Still undecided but will smell on the right female to FULLY make up my mind. Will update soon!"

I am not an expert.

Just received this perfume as a birthday gift - unbelievably strange. I think I love it??? It is a very strong and powerful scent; on initial application it smells fresh and vanillery but the strangest thing happens as it drys - apart from the fact that it lasts for ages it starts to remind me of unwashed hair - like a pheromone smell. It's sort of captivating and dirty but I like it. There's a smell of cloves which I love. It stays on my skin literally from shower to shower, not much will shift this scent. I wore a different perfume today but despite many reapplications I can still smell Musc Ravageur - I think I may have got some on my watch. It is a very private and personal scent; I'm almost embarrassed to wear it in public! I want to spray myself in it and spend some time with him...............just us......"

Still this is to me like a Shalimar with a bit of christmas spices and a bit more ""darkness"". It lacks the ""sparkle"" of Shalimar, and thus smells a bit more masculine. I still think it is very easy to wear as a woman.

The only other Fredric Malle I have tried is Portrait of a Lady, which performs very well on my skin (few fragrances do) unfortunately Musc Ravageur needs heavier application to last, and the sillage is lesser. I love these types of scents to waft around me, so that is a slight disappointment. I do find that Shalimar edp envelops me more in the cold, so that might be the case with this one as well.

I really like this and have no doubts I will finish my bottle. It's an easy oriental and very balanced and smooth to my nose."

I get that medicinal vibe in the opening, it's because of the clove. Can't get past that, it ruins the whole composition for me. It's like a visit in a very cosy pharmacy.
Not a fan of a perfume with the tonka/lavender/amber accord either, so it is not my cup of tea.
Having that in mind: the musk and vanilla blend is masterful to the point when it doesn't smell neither like musk, nor like vanilla anymore.
Feels like an afterglow of what a legend of a perfume it used to be before the reformulation. Opinion, not fact.
Is it worth to buy a bottle of a perfume just to learn how a good blend of musk & vanilla smells? No. Is it worth sampling for educational purposes? Definitely.

Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","I get the slightest amount of something citric in the opening. And as we all know, then comes the infamous spicy blend of cloves, cinnamon, and a synthetic civet (or musk) accord. I have a decant of the supposed reformulation and I had a sample several years back and I can assure you some minor tweaks have been made since Malle announced he had to reformulate some fragrances due to IFRA restrictions. The musk and cloves in the older sample were much more pronounced. I totally understood why some people would hate this aspect of the scent.

The recent formulation is still amazing but slightly watered down. The mid is unmistakably spicy and there is a creamy vanilla present in the background but I wouldn't call Musc Ravageur a vanilla scent nor a gourmand, at all. The cloves are very prominent to my nose, but Roucel blended the spiciness and the sweeter vanilla accords with such finesse, that the overall result is exquisite. The musk or civet is lurking beneath the spicy melange but it will never be too animalic or challenging unless you're not used to orientals in general. The drydown is a creamy mix of vanilla, soft spices, and woods.

Performance is great, it is no beast by any means, but it will last for quite some time on skin. I like this scent so much that I would say you can wear this in more casuals settings as well (office included) and even though it is perfect for colder weather, it could be worn year round if applied accordingly.

One of Malle's best in the line and in my opinion Roucel's magnum opus. A classic which will never go out of style.

I know Civet and Deer Musk is different because my hometown has a civet farm, civet is the way more stinky and fishy and you can find it in Kouros. Deer musk the way more subtle, animalic make it smell a bit like harsh urine that get rid of ammonia, touch of powdery and fresh skin."

However the last couple of weeks i have been trying to persuade myself that i like Musc Ravageur. While i have not completely succeeded, i managed to appreciate it significantly more, as i now dont hate it anymore.
It is musky, it is warm, cosy , it is strange and it is full of cinnamon. This is a fragrance with a unique character.
If it is to be worn, i think one should spray a very small quantity, otherwise victims may occur.
It is so unlike anything else i have smelled that i would perhaps even try to trace down the wearer, just from curiosity.
Overall i find Musc Ravageur to be a special fragrance, but quite peculiar and hard to wear too.

Straight up in the first seconds the bergamot and lavender give a bitter and slightly sweet combination, like being outdoors surrounded by bushes. Within a couple of minutes the woods come through and the feeling of being outdoors is accentuated. At about five minutes the spices are discernible along with woods, lavender and bergamot, and at this point there are wonderful relaxing notes in the air around you. Soon the vanilla joins in the dance and for about three hours you will smell fabulous.

- Opens up with a heavy does of mostly clove plus spices, sharp and strong. The longest opening you can think of, about 90 minutes of clove. If you don't like clove, this will bug you!

- After these 90 minutes you will start getting the musk, vanilla and oranges, now this bit is identical to Meharées. The dry down is stunning, IMO.

- Performance 10 to 12 hours, on my t-shirt, two days!
- I love the scent but people around me were rather ""meh"" about it (brother, friends, a date), it doesn't ""smell like sex"" or anything like that.

- MR and Meharées are identical in the drydown, Meharées doesn't have the clove opening, costs 22 euros, but I am allergic to something in it!! MR is expensive, performs 3x or 4x times better than Meharées and the quality is higher (no allergens, presentation, performance,..).

All in all, I find Meharées a safe blind buy and if you are not allergic like me, I would say value to money, get Meharées."

When the vanilla dissapears It turns Aldo more animalic, It smell a bit like dried saliva, a bit like the dry down of perfumes like kouros and, depending on the moment, that could be addictive or a bit annoying... The smell at opening makes me remember a lot when my grandmother cooked vanilla flan... It is a very similar scent!! Or something like flanin el niño! ;)

Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","Update:

I know Esteē Lauder bought EDP Frederic Malle back in 2015. I've been wearing Musc Ravageur, my signature perfume (and I mean, I wear it everyday, day and night, all seasons), for approximately 8 years (3 years or so before it was included in EL's portfolio).

I must say again, I love the perfume and wouldn't think about wearing any other as my signature perfume, even though I wear 2-4 perfumes layered under Musc Ravageur sometimes.

That said and coming back from a cosmetic retail background, I know EL always changes formulations and/or dilutes them (wether it's perfumes or makeup) in order to maximize profits shortly after acquiring any brand. In my opinion, they respected Musc Ravageur's formulation for a few years. But I've noticed a difference in my last two bottles. The scent itself has not been compromised, but the concentration has.

I don't know what the original concentration was as many perfume houses do not disclose that information (if any of you know such information, I'd appreciate it if you share).

I will still keep it as my go to, signature perfume, but I have to change the numbers in my previous rating:

Lasting power: 6/10 (it used to last so long, that after washing my clothes, whenever I had to iron something, it still smelt like Musc). Not the case any longer, but I must say, after 6+ hrs, I can still get a faint whiff every so often (as some people around me can, as well).
Sillage: 7/10
The sillage was enormous. I know this is a turn off for many people. Not for me. I am confident enough to enter a room and have people notice my presence before they see me because they can smell me. Some of them are a bit too sensitive to the scent. I truly don't care (I do not work in an office environment).
Now, I've noticed the projection is approximately 8-10 feet max.

The only thing I'm thankful for is that the formulation has not been compromised, albeit, it's diluted.

I didn't try it when it was launched.

There's a WOW factor here in the proposal to use ingredients present in easy-to-wear perfumes (above cited), but here finely tuned to assume their most natural and organic form possible, without aromatic disguises of pleasantness, sweetness or roundness: a nirvana for connoisseurs of high-level aromatic organicity.

Nothing skanky or body odor either. Very spicy/herbal amber/cinnamon. This is my only experience with MR, so I can't comment on reforms/orig juice.

Has a rather ""barbershop"" drydown. Maybe I need to wait until warmer temps if I want the unique skanky weirdo MR.

Formal wearing UPDATE- WOW!! Ok, so apparently the best day to test this was last night, lol.
A foot of new snow, 20-30 mph gusty winds, 10 degrees-- and Musc Ravageur. Shoveling snow creates sweat/body heat, but the temps are insanely cold, and I LOVE MR!
This is like L de Lolita plus armpit man sweat- IN THE BEST WAY. A spicy masculine sweat- kinda like the way I dig the hot body odor in Dune.
The next morning, I still had MR on my shirt and it smelled like L de Lolita sprayed over 2-week old Angel (patchouli)- and I liked it!
But... I found sillage to be sad/weak. Sure it HAD sillage and longevity, but not nearly enough for a $250+ perfume. I was heavy with the sprays which I suppose is what you have to do.

I got more cloves than lavender on my skin- which is good. My skin wearing wasn't Jicky-like at all (and I like Jicky!). My proper body test was skin only. I also love the WARMTH from this perfume, even if it's in my imagination from the cold Michigan winter.

My yesterday tissue test is all L de Lolita.

It hits you throughout the day sometimes intensifying and then going back to being subdued. Best time to wear this is during autumn/winter as the cold carries the fragrance and also makes certain notes stand out. I also had really good experiences when wearing this in air conditioned environments.

This is a beast mode performance fragrance therefore you don't need to apply much, I get between 10-12hrs where it projects for the first 6hrs and finally dries down remaining close to the skin.

This fragrance is not versatile making it only wearable for certain specific occasions. Essentially if you don't wear this right... you could potentially have a bad experience :)

Musc Ravageur to me will always be in the top ten best fragrances of all time, it is so far above others in the genre making it a timeless classic.

Please sample this before purchasing, not for everyone."

After 10 min it became sweeter and musky then dissapeared....so I thought. I must become nose blind because people keep telling me I smell sweet and I smell good. The next time I wore this the opening smells almost identical to Tom Ford Black Orchid . it really does. After an hour the dry down smells like the opening of L de Lolita. It's not as sweet and it's a little musky. ..a little dirty but so addictive. I don't know if I have an older bottle but it smells a lot different to me than what a lot of the other reviewers were saying. I smell it longer than normal now and don't become as nose blind to it as fast which is strange to me. Sometimes when I get wafts of it it smells like Black Orchid other times if I smell it from my clothing it smells like l d Lolita..it's different and it's beautiful. I wish I could smell it all the time instead of in wafts."

I always have issues picking the right occasion to wear it. The dirty aspect might offend some people, but I usually wear it during intimate moments, and it seems to be working just fine.

It might be gamble to wear it in crowded environments, unless you seek attention (not necessarily positive).

Actually current Shalimar is very modern and more complex than Musc Ravageur in my opinion. Musc Ravageur is not musky or animalic as well. This is ambery oriental (patchouli, vanilla) with the bright citrus blend of bergamot and mandarin. I remember first time I smelled years ago there was an animalic musk inside but current version is not anmilic as before."

I actually perceive Meharees as more musky! Which in my book is a good thing!

Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","I have had decant of this unusual masterpiece for past month and a half but whenever i start to write about it, i often am out of right words.Musc ravageur is not a fragrance but an experience. If category of niche fragrarances can be defined by a single fragrarance, i would vote for this one.

I may fail to do so but let me try painting an olfactory image of musc ravageur. Think of it as a pheromones excreted by a male animal to attract its female counterpart or a scent of man when he is at its most sensual.

So how has perfumer achieved this unusual scent? I'm no expert but i think cloves and black musc are key players. To my nose, this starts of with cloves (lots of cloves) which can be deal breaker for many like the note of cummin. Black musc must be the ingredient responsible for that pheromonic smell. There is certain bitterness to it which can attributed to use of citruses. After a while bitterness subsides leaving a pretty linear scent until a late dry down where vanilla lends a semi sweetness to whole concoction.

Kind of scent it is, i did not expect it to be loud projector. It remains close to you with above average longevity. To be really honest, i always wash it after few hours as this can be quite cloying in hot humid weather. But I'm sure this would be a stunner in cold weather. Occasion wise, it is neither a casual scent nor an office one but i could see it working well when you are suited up. Truth be told, i might not even dare wearing it even suited up.

This is ultra niche, there is nothing like it and i doubt there ever will be. No one should blind buy it but if you see fragrarance as a form of art, this is a must try"

Not liking the cinnamon and cloves, burns my nose, then the cloyingly sweet comes up, an hour later it’s all gone, no it’s just no good. I will finish up the 5mil sample but i will not be buying a full bottle. I will stick with my beloved Tom Ford, Amouage, Chanel, Guerlain and Dior. I have tried to like FM perfumes, I have sampled about 15 of his perfumes and I either really hate them or just don’t like any. Im not into crazy overpriced perfumes that are not worth the high prices. Some of these perfume houses have some nerve charging the exuberant high prices they do for the terrible perfume concoctions they put out. They should not be allowed to get away with it. But as long as ignorant ppl will pay their asking price, they’ll just keep ripping u off. I don’t mind paying $$$$ for a great Niche or Brand name perfume but it had better be worth it and none of FM perfumes are worth even a fraction of the price they charge. Ughhhh they’re as bad as that other overpriced terrible brand Bond #9. Or that incredibly awful gorilla perfumes. I have learned long ago the hard way to never blind buy a full bottle of perfume based on other ppl great reviews. Always get a sample first and get it from a Dept store or from the brands website, never from eBay or even those sites that sell decant 2mil perfume samples, they too are huge rip offs, they water it down or add alcohol to it . You will know as soon as u compare the sample u bought from them to one u get from any Dept store such as Saks. I’m in NYC so I get my samples at Saks or Nordstrom. If you do not get your decant sample from a legit place then u can never be 100% sure what u have is authentic."

It then dusks with dregs of some really good vanilla setting the mood for a toffeed-up version of the amber of Shalimar humming a noir version of Tainted Love to appear and meet a ""bow chikka wow wow"" musk. Then they run to let nature take its course. A modern woods and linalool spice accord takes away the 70s gold chain over chest hair vibe for a black tie over a loosened collar. Sexy? Yes. But not nearly as dirty or sexual as I thought it would be imo, this isn´t Jim Morrison in black leather pants sprayed with MKK but still great."

The manufacturers muted the Cinnamon & Clove and almost removed the animalic facet of the Musk. As a result, current formulation of the fragrance appears to be more citrusy, which by nature is fleeting. Therefore it is more airy and lower in performance.

In 2018 I finally pulled the trigger on Meharées from L'Erbolario along with Dolcelisir from the same brand. In my humble opinion, L'Erbolario is same in the air, as the current formulation. Love it even more coz I saved a ton of cash.

IFRA killed fragrances & continues to do so.

Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","This fragrance is not linier. There are 3 distinct phases: In the opening, you do not get the listed top notes as much as the musc, cinnamon, and cloves, that are the strongest. This is the most polarizing phase. It's the one that many don't like, calling it medicinal, mothballs, and urinals I've read.
It was challenging for me at this point, as it seemed the musc was too harsh, before coming into balance.

The second phase is the best, and is the heart of the fragrance. It's when the harsher notes of Musc and spices, comes into balance with the gourmand aspects of the sweet vanilla and tonka.
The overbearing top notes of Musc and cloves settle to reveal the lavender, woods.
You get the gingerbread, or caramel taffy, together with the musc and spices.

The. 3rd phase is when the musc and spices fade, and you get mostly a creamy smooth gourmand scent of gingerbread, tonka, woods, and a bit of lingering Musc in the background.

So the middle and last phase are most enjoyable. I still like the challenging opening. It's an acquired taste in the opening.
I can see this becoming a signature fragrance. I've noticed my favorite fragrances were challenging at first, then I acquired a taste for them. So it is with Musc Ravageur. The blending is tight. It's strong and aggressive, but everything feels in balance. It smells like a great timeless classic, which it is.

It is more gourmand than Labdanum 18, yet darker and more aggressive. Labdanum 18 is very similar, but it's a soft Oriental.

The fragrance is the most Classic smelling of all the Malles. It is my second favorite after ""French Lover"".

PS: My 100 ml from eBay just came in. I was reviewing from my 10 ml. Maybe the bottle I got is more vintage. The opening has a rich, more natural and anamalic musc.
It has a bit smoother opening, I like it. Got a good bottle:)

It is created for a man as i see it, cant really imagine it on a woman. Roucels picture with great mustache is exactly what this scent is about. Opening to me is very much star anise. its very strong at the beginning, and as it was a blind buy of mine - i was a little put off. as perfume shifts - in around 5-10 mins, all other notes start to come out. main players here are cinnamon, musc, sweetish vanilla/amber. probably woods as well, since there is something masculine about it. when you read notes, you might think its too simple but its not true. this does turn to warm/dry/spicy cashmere like aura of the wearer without any gourmand, cinnabun parallels. it is sexy i would say, but there is nothing skanky. it doesnt smell old, but it is for a confident man. you cant be a shy tender flower and wear this. compliment getter, excellent blended, long lasting. i would say around 10 hours on me, which is excellent. Silage is not enormous, but you will be noticed. batch that i have is A28. never tried the original, but this one is quite good in my books :)"

Later the coumarin is sprinkled with some dry warm spice powder, which secretly steals the show. Still, it’s a sweet show.

Although I’m glad they took out (or toned down) sticky vanilla which I absolutely hate, but now this is ...too monotonous. I mean, why pay a few hundreds dollars for a bottle of...coumarin (or musk)?"

They all start like pretty much different perfumes, later in the drydown one can spot some similarities with MR.

Meharees - initially heavier on the citruses and lighter on the spices, a softer and ""thinner"" scent with moderate projection, yet good longevity, the drydown is closest to MR;

Labdanum 18 playing the odd one out in the beginning, obviously with more detectable labdanum, resembling more Shalimar than MR at that stage, not spicy, least sweet from the bunch, soft projection, good longevity;

L de Lolita showcasing lots of gorgeous vanilla, vanilla and more vanilla, the sweetness is balanced well though, amazing projection, good longevity, the drydown resembles MR+vanilla;

Initially Musc Ravageur is undoubtedly the winner, being deeper, more complex, richer in spices (more cinnamon than cloves), projects as well as L de Lolita.

However, after around 7-8 hours the differences between them are not that obvious. Still my favourites are MR because of how intoxicating it smells in the beginning and L de Lolita because of that yummy vanilla top note and amazing projection.

If I had to keep just one, having all four, I'd choose MR. If I didn't have any of the four and had to buy one, I'd buy MR if money allowed or Meharees if I were money conscious."

If that's what you're after - and it is often what I'm after, then this one certainly delivers - right on the doorstep!

I do realise there's other notes in this also; but it is really all about showcasing the musk, in this one.

I realise there is a reasonable manners ethic towards other reviewers on this site, but I'm afraid I've just been pushed beyond bursting point - & also how is it that there seems to be a culture of sending perfumes back on none-other grounds than not liking the perfume - caveat emptor! + some of it has been used!! ... and someone buys a perfume called Musc Ravageur and proposes to send it back to ebay™ on grounds that it may cause them to smell reminiscently of a furry animal!!?

I made a blind buy online, and I'm on the fence about it I have to admit.
What stands out to me, some 15 mins after applying, is an earthy animalic outdoorsy undertone, with wafts of lavender, vanilla, tonka and a bit of cinnamon on top. Imo when just applied it's not as nice as from 10 mins onwards, only then it gets to radiate a true scent harmony and becomes a bit powdery, which I like very much. Animalic musk, vanilla and lavender keep occupying main stage on my skin, can't help being reminded of vintage Jicky a bit. A great reference to some probably...
And as well as Jicky, MR to me doensn't confess to gender.
Is MR for me though? I have to say no. Just how Jicky isn't for me either. If anyone is interested in swapping an almost full 200 gr pot please PM me."

Musc Ravageur draws the bone structure from Shalimar EDP, cuts off the citrus and leathery note, then blends with some specific resinous and semi-fougere note a la YSL Opium Homme.

I like it, not sure if it is full bottle worthy yet.

Okay here’s the deal.. it has ingredients that invokes an older smell.. but the good sweet older smell that’s intoxicating.. only with superb ingredients and quality blend. More importantly what is considered “old” is not really the case here... it is not an old smell but invokes imagery settings of older times! This is unique and in my eyes a brilliant idea for future fragrances.

Beyond the blended foundation.. here’s what pops out:

• powdered sugar (funnel cake)
• Apple cobbler
• baby doll

Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","Musc Ravegeur is my first introduction to Frederic Mall. I love it! I had tried several musc-oriented fragrances in the past, but often were hits-and-misses. I am not sure whether my skin chemistry is not quiet compatible with musc-based fragrances or some other reasons. However, Musc Ravegeur behaves so well with my skin. It opens with a huge blast of spicy musk, probably due to the presence of cloves and cinnamon that are so obvious to me on the top notes.Some may find the opening is very challenging. After about half an hour, the magic begins. It becomes so warm and comforting. The spicy notes still present, but much calmer, and in fact, adds a nice touch on the overall scent. I find Musc Ravegeur very comforting to me. It lasts throughout my working day, but becomes much closer to the skin. On clothes, it will last for a long time. I feel this fragrance is more appropriate for colder season. I would not wear this in the heat of summer. I believe women can wear this with confidence as well. Overall, Musc Ravegeur is a very alluring musc-based fragrance, and a very comforting one. This is a real fine offering by Frederic Malle. The asking price is steep, but indeed matches the quality of this fragrance."
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","The great thing about Musc Ravageur is..theres no white musk at all. Anywhere. Thank the GODS. No laundry scent. No clean, cold sharpness. This is warm..it has a heartbeat. Its heartbeat is masterfully pared down into its basic components of some of the most classic oriental spicy amber accord made famous in the past with icons such as COCO, Opium and Shalimar.

Its warm and cozy as cashmere and a easy wear in the fall and winter if you have worn some of the oriental icons of past decades. Its a gingerbread warm cookie and a chai latte by the fireplace. It leans almost silky gourmand to make this a new way of an classic idea. Bravo Malle. Just lovely."

Fuzzy and a bit dusty. Some vanilla, gently sweet. A hint of baking spices...

Can't believe I've waited so long to get with Musc Ravageur. Was on a shortlist of fragrances to try years ago, during a brief obsession with animalics, but I never ended up sampling it. When I finally did, a few days ago, it exceeded my high expectations. Was an easy purchase decision to get a full bottle.

This is essentially a slightly civety musk cushioned in a pillow of spiced, milky vanilla. The longevity is rather good; projection is low after the first hour. More of a sexy skin scent vibe.

It's great stuff - I'm hooked :)"
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","Very oriental. Lot of cloves and cinnamon; some vanilla, musk, wood and maybe a floral. Spicy, medicinal vibe from the cloves. Drydown smells kind of like Jovan Musk but less floral.

MR is unisex leaning feminine with an 0ld lady vibe. Mature and for cooler weather. There are better scents for work but worse ones too. I don't find it sexy. Lasted about five hours with average sillage and projection. I swear I could still smell it faintly after a shower. Notes are natural smelling as expected from Frederic Malle but I just don't care for the composition. MR uses clove and cinnamon too heavily for my taste but I suppose this is an Oriental style perfume. It should perform better for this price imo. Musc Ravageur doesn't do much for me."

The Beast from tale of ""Beauty and the beast "" is the best way to explain how feelings of this fragrance, you can run away from it at the first sight because the raw beast but you will falling in love when you know him.
This fragrance open with raw dry vanilla and raw musky.
I personally like this fragrance, but I hesitate to say I love it (at first). This is combination of old fashion and classic way, the ancient powdery scent combining with animalic in the background reminded me of "" Shalimar ""(not similar but same feeling).

This is sexy? Maybe, it a kind of dark side of sexiness.

Scent 8/10 (I hate it at first, a month later I just can't stop thinking about it!)
Project 8/10 (Arm length on my skin, and middle project better than open!)
Longevity 8.5/10 ( About 8-10 hrs )

The musky note in this fragrance so fierce like the tiger at the open and dry down to dried raw vanilla and sweet ( clove in this fragrance not dominant the scent, but mixed and blended seamlessly with other very well to make it darker and dense.)

""Don't trust what the eyes can see and judge it at the first sign, spend more time to know this beast than you might falling in love... ""

Open as Beast/Dark/Raw/Ancient , dry down to Gentle/Sweet/Romance"

2009 version review: this one starts off with cloves and cinnamon. the cloves starts to decrease leaving room for the cinnamon, musk and vanilla to take over and transform the smell into a border-line gourmand . it is also powdery. this fragrance lasts very long. i could still smell it on my skin almost 24 hours after application as a creamy fragrance.

9.2/10"
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","2009 formula on skin: This is considered dirty? It's a soft sweet amber gourmand that invites me to come closer. Faintly powdery, although not in a talc kind of way. Feminine rather than masculine. I guess my nose reads ""animalic"" musk as ""skin"".

Very strong in the summer heat, so I apply it very lightly and I think it works in the air conditioned indoors. I wouldn't wear it outside though. Some heavy scents like L'air du Desert Marocain work outdoors on a summer day despite the heat, but IMO Musk Ravageur is too sweet.

Edit: Wow. This worked on its intended target; let's leave it at that. ;)"
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","Frederic Malle should have named this fragrance 'Cinnamon Ravageur'! I was expecting loads of animalic musk, but when I sprayed this on, the strongest notes that emerged were cinnamon, cloves and vanilla, with some tame musk in the background. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I am testing this frag in a very hot and humid weather, and it might work differently when it's colder outside. Still, I didn't expect such a Christmas-like, almost edible concoction. So, if you're looking for a festive treat that projects strongly and lasts for hours, buy this fragrance; on the other hand, if you're looking for a dirty musk-bomb, look elsewhere."
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","I have a weird bond with Musc Ravageur. One where I am ambivalent about it, don’t know if I love it or not but for some reason I keep using it and smelling my wrist when I do. It reminds me of an unhealthy relationship with a woman, where she is married and you have an affair. You know it’s wrong, you know it’s never going to go anywhere serious and each time you are done having your raunchy and dirty session, you leave feeling guilty and confused but you keep coming back for more because you can’t help it…

It opens very spicy and earthy (cloves) also with an orange note and an aromatic lavender giving off a kind of medicinal vibe to the top. Could be the smell of a cinnamon/cloves ointment for sore muscles. In the background as the name implies you can find an amazing dirtier musk for a more carnal, sexual side with a “hairy” feel or texture to me. As time passes by the musky cinnamon stays and is joined by a smoother vanilla giving off a strong Cinnabon aura. So in the end I get a warm, very spicy Cinnabon with a light chocolate vibe and covered with vanilla while laying on a farm goat or a sheep’s clean hair. Does it sound weird to you? Yeah to me too, but somehow it looks like it works and I own a bottle of it. Why? I couldn’t tell you, but it lures me in. Damn you Musc Ravageur."
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","This smells exactly like one of those vanilla-scented plastic dog bones you find at the pet shop. It even has a note of animalic raunchiness. My pipe aficionado uncle used to have a mean little dog named Mugsy, and the house smelled like Captain Black pipe tobacco and Musc-Ravageur-scented dog toys. All pleasant memories, but I don’t want to smell like Mugsy."
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","First I smelled this olfactory decadence on a friend, then I ordered a sample. I wore the sample out, then dove in for a 100ml bottle. Not the 50, the 100, because I will be wearing this frequently. Velvety Oriental notes, deep, warm vanilla and spice layered with wood... I'm all in. As a middle aged woman who can't stand wearing florals, this fits the bill in so many ways. Gourmand without being foody or cloyingly sweet. Sensual, earthy, and as others have stated, easier to wear than Shalimar (which I still appreciate).

A single spray makes for a pleasant skin scent I can enjoy all day while working at my desk. Two sprays and people around me start to notice. Three and I think I'd have to leave the room. Longevity is excellent, especially on clothes."
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","Lovely in winter and straight up sex in summer. I wear it in both seasons and it brings completely different scents. In the winter the clove is more dominant and I get more cinnamon. In the summer it is sweeter, more animalic and somehow fresher, IMO. I know many people think this cannot be pulled off in summer, but that is not correct. Regulation
of your sprays will make a huge difference. Try a spray or two on a summers evening and embrace the magic!

Compliments are many, but I wear this for me and my lady."

And I'm not even that much of a fan of strong oriental powerhouses. I don't get that much of vanilla and cinnamon... Jut throwback 80's sweetish musk (similar to civet), elegant woods in the background (sandalwood and guaiac), and a little bit of fruity/sweet and herbal soapy notes in the background for a balance. Non cloying vanilla is dancing around somewhere there all the time. It's strong but still fresh at the same time.
It has a yin, masculine energy and gives you confidence, but is definitely unisex. Overall gives me an Italian vibe. :)"
Musc Ravageur Frederic Malle (unisex) ~ 2000,"['warm spicy', 'vanilla', 'powdery', 'musky', 'cinnamon', 'woody', 'amber', 'sweet', 'aromatic', 'lavender']","This is just so addictive, so sexy, so heavenly..just everything in a bottle! When I first sprayed it on paper, I wasn't so sure I liked this scent. But after I put the paper on my desk and came back to my room an hour later... The whole room smelled like heaven! I bought the 100ml bottle right away the next day, and it's still the best thing I have ever done..

On my skin it smells very smoky. musky vanilla, like vanilla burning and surrounded by smokes and fumes, and musks lingering in the background. I can't even explain how beautiful the scent is, I'm just so happy to have this scent in my room. Now the weather is changing to hot, humid summer, which sadly means that I wouldn't be able to spray this for a while. Waiting for cold weather so that I can spray this again soon..

Although this is my favorite scent and I can't express all my love for this, I wouldn't recommend a blind buy. To me, it definitely smelled much better on my skin than on paper, but this might depend on each person's skin chemistry and tastes. But if you like oriental, smoky vanilla, this probably would easily become your favorite too.

Edit: Most people seem to think of this as somewhat masculine.. To me it's just totally unisex. I'm a tiny young woman and I really enjoy it on myself. Goes well with both genders. And what does masculine really mean, anyways? ;)"

Trying it now, I kind of love it. The difference may be due to either me knowing more about fragrances or a reformulation - for the better (which is unusual). Perhaps it is a combination of the two - a perfection of the blend, as well as an improvement of my nose.

The notes are well known, with musk, amber, vanilla being in focus. I am sensitive to vanilla and cannot stand too much of it. Fortunately this vanilla is not very sweet and not too domineering, though I could still wish for less.

It is extremely well blended and is a 'sexy' skin fragrance, one of the few original and among the best in today's world."

My skin kils it every time, I swear. For an hour or two it's spectacular and then it's just plain musky slightly spicy vanilla for another two and then... nothing.
